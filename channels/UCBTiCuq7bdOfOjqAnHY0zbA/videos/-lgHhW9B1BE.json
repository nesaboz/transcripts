    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the september 8 2021 regular council meeting of the city of delaware beach before we do the pledge of allegiance um [Music] i have some horrible news that i have to give everyone um on august 25th my dear friend josh hollis passed away from building he's 39 years old meets his wife and his son buck and my heart goes out to you guys josh was a very dedicated uh citizen of our city he served on our board of adjustment and he was about the best friend he could ever have there is a service on saturday the 11th [Music] at 2pm this saturday at the country christian church that's at 1850 north mcmullen booth road in clearwater the city is invited to it's a celebration of his life um it's gonna be tough with them but we're going to try and make it through the back of my heart that's out to your family please join me in a moment of silence for josh please stand he's done like fourth place councilmember robin hockey and councilwoman banker brother councilmember glenn dunn yeah councilmember leslie ontario here council member rita squad here vice mayor david davis here mayor joseph banzo yeah city manager lynn reeves yeah and city attorney fred wright here okay thank you so the first item of business is the approval of the agenda do i have a motion moved by um leslie monterro second second by dave gaddis on the question mr chairman sure i'd like to amend the agenda for tonight regarding an issue which happened last thursday september 2nd my amendment for discussion with boston beach and parking access along with safety and possible detriment to our lot of 12th street i asked last thursday for this to be put on the agenda for tonight and was referenced by your questions not timely because the agenda items need to be placed by wednesday while i'm not disputing this requirement even though this council meeting was set six days later the incident where amendment i request directly impacts our residents and other residents which have addressed this past council units therefore mr chairman my request is now timely since the adoption of the agenda has not taken place and my request for the amendment falls under the rules of robert's rules awards thank you um before i ask for a second on that first let me ask for a second on that do we have a second on that second okay second uh city attorney and i'm going to be asking for a change on this agenda also typically you have to pre-advertise the uh any agenda items or to be official this does not i do not believe this incurs an expenditure of money but it is something that was brought up i believe by mr van gogh earlier um there is no rule that you know that's that's our role our house rule here that a thursday afternoon and has to be done um it has been as early as wednesday it can be later there's no real rule from florida as to when something can change on an agenda so i'll certainly entertain this but first i have to seek your approval as to whether this would be an appropriate amendment i know certain ones wouldn't be but this one's different [Music] the question is whether you should allow an amendment to address an issue at this point if it passes yes this amendment that mr uh that council member has proposed i'm having all sorts of trouble hearing you because you're a mask sorry i'm you know i'm trying to understand this thing it sucks and i don't want anybody else getting hurt so fully understand that the what i understand the situation is i the agenda was finalized and then was sent out is that correct i can't hear you it was sent out the next morning i think what patty's sent to councilmember was what it says okay well my response is if if a item comes up and especially if it's not requiring an expenditure of funds you're not entering into a contract you're going to discuss something that is uh a very relevant thing then i think if the council wants to allow it to be discussed then you ought to let it be discussed with that i'll open up the council of discussion this is in play any discussion this is only on the amendment on bankruptcy i would like to hear the amendment one more time service remember uh my amendment goes to beach parking beach access and possible detriment to the lot of 12th street and the safety accessing the beach on an issue that occurred on september 2nd would this be something that we're voting on no okay eventually will it come up to a vote you think i on this amendment no i don't believe it will come up to a financial mode it's just a very good channel i don't believe so okay i got a question to you you stated this is the 12th street beach access correct correct okay so that's dollar short property and i'm not sure that that would be considered bella beach's city business to discuss so i'm not sure why we would even be involved in that discussion i uh beg to differ whether that's bella or shore's property according to the three deeds that are recorded in this office and this county of canals which clearly says i believe i can read i can read the lot in question and i want to quote from the commands of february 12 1948 states that said parties are the first part and for consideration of the sum of one dollar to them in the hand paid by seth said party the second part and a quote that's bellerin peach receive aware of is hereby acknowledged at granted morgan sold conveyed and confirmed an easy presence pr due grant morgan seldom ban confirmed unto said party of the second part against our beach and its successes forever the following parcel of land and situated in the counties of canelo state florida i'll help you out a little bit i know a little bit about this um city bellar beach every citizen east of the center line of both boulevard has a perpetual easement that runs with their land and utilize those lots to be conveying purposes and if i i i'm not positive that i know what i'm speaking about but i have a pretty good idea what it is and uh that absolutely impacts the ability for the citizens to u4 so it is city business no disrespect i'm not sure you actually know what this is about but um again it's a safety issue it's our resonance our residents were impacted directly i was impacted and i just would like to explain to council [Music] any other council comments this is just on the important question yeah did you say a september second incident correct okay so there's we know i mean i know nothing about the september second amendment it sounds like maybe it's something more appropriate for council comments at the end than putting it on as an agenda item well i believe it should be an agenda item because if it would have fell if the incident would have happened september 1st i would have been on the eject but because it fell on september 2nd it was a day later then the agenda was written i would have been it would have been timely submitted but because we have that rule the wednesday before is am i the only one in council that has no idea what the september second incident was so i feel you know it's hard to try to discuss something on the agenda that you well can you remember what it is i can briefly discuss it right now if i'm allowed we have to get an approval to at least add it to there because we're still in the approval of agenda so vermont um to the council you're going to have to trust councilmember bangkok that he says this is important it's something we need to know about if you don't think that that's the case then vote it down it's the banker i'm telling you right now council going to members a little session right after the next budget i have a number of issues that i'm going to deal with i'll be speaking about tonight okay i'm done with this and i have a number of issues that i'm going to be speaking about tonight and they're gonna be handling the work session we're gonna be doing stuff so that is the secondary option if for some reason you don't get this opportunity but if it's an emergent manner i'm with the city attorney i want to hear it the only the only reason i would like to put it on the agenda item is because the people in this room are here now the council speaks about their personal agenda or whatever most these people probably home and in bed okay where i'd like to be sometimes but because of the fact i see some people that this impacted directly so i think it plus what i what i want to bring up is people already assigned the council and addressed the council about i this let's let's agree to put it on the agenda because in the future one of us may bring up another issue that we feel is important and just to extend the courtesy to frank like we would like it to be extended to us in the future so on the sense of good faith and trust and and i would do this for each and one of you if you felt strongly about something i support them council comments my recommendation would be to move it or to add an agenda item 22a that does move to the end but if it makes it an official agenda item ten minutes later five minutes later he's going to be able to speak anyway let's go ahead and give him the benefit of the doubt and uh and put it on as an agenda it's the 22 amended 22a okay um citizens any comments on that just on that done back to here leslie detero you had the last word if you'd like before we call it for a vote just for frank's amendment you you move the motion so i did the motion of the agenda myself i'm sorry so yeah so frank you actually have the last word no more word no more word okay so um let's do a uh let's now you know what let's just call it i'd rather just just go through call the role please okay so this let me call this question so this is to amend the agenda as item 22a for the proposal of frank bancard regarding uh 12th street access and some um observations and information that he has that he wants to give to council he'll show up on regular agenda item 22a yes vote gets it on the agenda novo keeps it off i'm clark council member aki aye california banker yes gunn aye councilman ontario hi happy member school hi thanks for your guidance all right all right so seven to zero frank you'll leave that at 22 out of that okay thank you thank you okay so um with back to the regular agenda leslie didn't even have a chance to speak you did bury that motion regular attend any comments because i do i do want to make a proposed change to the agenda which now includes a 22a okay and i'm going to have one more for you okay so um items number 12 through 16 are authorizations for the city manager to act on various contracts if you total up these contracts they total almost three about three quarters of our annual operating budget and they're going to be passed on a consent agenda without discussion without discussion by the city without discussion by the council that is not what the state of florida envisions this is supposed to be a deliberative body so i'm going to make a motion that items 12 throughs and i'm making this motion and i'll tell you why i'm gonna pass the dabble if i get a second on it um i'm making this motion because i don't want this council to get themselves in trouble we cannot blow this stuff by without discussion there's three quarters of a million dollars of expenditure going down here and we are not passing that without discussion i don't care if there's no discussion ultimately on it we want to have that discussion out here and if we don't do that then woe to us because i do believe that we're violating several things including the sunshine law the public meetings law and allowing the citizens to have the opportunity to speak this should never be in the consent agenda so items 12 through 16 is my motion do i have a second and i will pass together second second thank you dave daddy's you're the chair of this part just for my emotion i'm first because i was the one who prayed who proposed it so it's this simple okay as i just said we basically have items 12 through 16 on here item 13 is a 52 000 contract item 14 is a 58 350 contract um an inner local agreement is number 15 there's no dollars attached to that item 16 is a 304 thousand dollar contract and i skipped item 12 which is a 522 000 contract that's almost 900 000 on a 1.2 million dollar budget what are we thinking that we're going to pass this without allowing you the citizens to be able to speak there's approval of police in here there's approval of new garbage fees in here and you deserve to be heard on it and so does this council i have questions on several of these some of them i have absolutely no questions on this is not consent agenda consent agenda is for recurring ministerial items it's national breast cancer awareness month don't laugh you don't understand it it's from ministerial items that's what the state statute says and fred riley has that statute i serve on four boards and not one of them tries to ram through stuff under the consent agenda including the minutes i have a problem with that these minutes in my opinion happen to be excellent there's not a problem with them but sometimes that's not the case we need to have the ability to deliberate this stuff and not ram it down your throat nine hundred thousand dollars worth of expenditure so please let's do the right thing and get this right the first time because if we don't then it's void abneto which means it's completely void contracts that's all i have to say about dave dennis back to you would any other council members like to make a comment yes i would um i'd like to ask the city attorney how does this violate any sunshine law or any other laws i don't know i'd like to ask the city manager have we not spoke about every one of these items in different work sessions and at other council meetings where everybody was allowed to say and speak about it at that time yes uh with the exception of the interlocal agreement everything else has been it's it's standard contracts for each year that we do any other council members yeah let me help you with that law i didn't have the opportunity to speak okay um mr reilly did make a recommendation that um basically would give the public the opportunity to speak on all consent agendas and that would that would resolve the issue so they could pick any one of them uh to uh to discuss um just throwing it out unfortunately that doesn't resolve the issue of the council which is also part of the public speaking so let's cut right to the chase folks you're going to find out some information about your police contract that maybe somebody doesn't want you to know i got that information but i can't give it to you right now because it's not going to be a discussion but we're going to ran through ran through without your discussion 522 000 expenditure the biggest single contract we have all year that doesn't merit discussion let me tell you what the city manager thought meridian discussion a 280 dollar bill from juventus for records requests that married in an hour and a half discussion a 320 bill from me that merited an hour and a half discussion but a 600 000 500 300 000 nah let's just rub or stamp it we could be out of here by seven o'clock it's not what our function is as a council as for consistency let's go back to last year 2020 every one of these items was in the regular agenda consistency i've been preaching it since i swore in as mayor so tell me what changed from last year to this year because the law certainly didn't change florida doesn't envision you passing three quarters of your budget without the citizens and council talking about it and no we didn't talk about this contract for the police it just came out i just found something out about this police contract that i want everybody in this town to know about it but i can't tell you because i'm not allowed to talk mr riley can you advise us what's the best course of action say that again i'm sorry can you advise us what's the best course of action whether or not these items should be put into the regular for discussion like what's the proper thing to do yeah i i made a mistake today and the mistake i made is i wrote an email and in the email i should have said and in hindsight i would have would have done this but didn't want to write another email when i said members of the public i should have said and city council members the easy solution to this predicament is to have anybody that is in this room that wants to comment on the items comment on the items and that way there's no issue whatsoever about whether there's compliance with the statute so that's that's my recommendation i had to do it over again this morning when i wrote the email i was said members of general public and the city council i thought that was implicit in what i said but i i i guess it was not so sorry for the confusion the object of doing this is to have transparency in government and to have people have the opportunity to be heard which means an opportunity to give input and whether you as the council want to take that into account in any way shape or form is up to you as the council okay yes uh with that said by our city attorney you rather get ours ourselves into a legal bind it doesn't look like there's a you know roman empire out there audience so let's just move this and let the people speak anyone in the audience like to speak on these topics just on these topics just on the agenda get us yes you're you're in the middle of addressing the amendment so i would suggest you complete that task and then go to the next step correct the amended amended [Music] amendment i have a couple of questions that i don't understand from your comments and what i'm reading on your agenda you mentioned an interlocal agreement is one of the items on this agenda can you how do i find out exactly what that entails what are the details of that there should be in the back um on the presentation table patty's nodding there's copies of the agenda there yeah and they're online police contract that you mentioned is there another way of finding out what's in that contract it should also yes it is in there if you look at the uh the consent agenda item numbers there further back in the agenda you'll see that there's an item number there there we have them tabs [Music] the agenda has been published for about six days now it's it's been available online be me that um it because i did look for the agenda for the budget yes mayor if i may um ms rodero you will have if this passes and these are moved to the regular agenda i will call each one of these for comment and public comment so you'll have that opportunity but we're going to move in there pretty quickly because it's going to come right after the minutes okay do we have any other citizens that like to comment on the manzo agenda agenda mandated agenda yes sir mr anger john hansig 22nd street the only comment i want to make about the mayor's motion amendment whatever is i would encourage you to seriously consider voting in favor of it we're all everybody in this room basically we're all taxpayers okay and i was a little surprised to hear for example that there's an issue in the sheriff's proposed budget i didn't have time to look through that you know i'm supposed to be retired and have all kinds of time and just get a paycheck but besides that um it's important that we all have the same information okay so i would just ask everybody on the council give it the benefit of the doubt there must be something there that's important enough that he brought it up just like mr banker did earlier and you gave him the benefit of the doubt it's all about us together as taxpayers thank you very much could anyone else like to comment back to council mr gunn out of curiosity the agenda items that are being questioned in the budget have there been any revisions i know we had two budget provisions but the concerns about the share budget there have been changes to that budget in those two divisions so i mean all these items have been discussed that we've had what two or three workshops to discuss the budget and none of these issues were brought up at that time no the the sheriff as an example gave us his budgeted number uh i submitted they submitted the contract which is it's pretty standard contract as they met with the city attorney he looked at it and said it was fine and i put it on the agenda so i just want to i just want to clarify that there haven't been any changes or any conspiracy theory here trying to slip one through at the last minute there's been adequate time in the budget sessions and reviews to discuss all these issues that are being brought up there's nothing secret and while i appreciate the ability of residents to make comments the process is working you've asked to remove things from the consent agenda i support that but i want to clarify that there hasn't been any sneaky or conspiratorial things taking place in the budget at the last last minute so while we can draw this out it's routine business for uh council to discuss lengthy intricate business details and finance debt work sessions and approve and get a consensus of those work sessions and then you come forward and in the interest of timeliness you you prove it on a consent agenda so i mean it's nothing new it gets done by large municipalities all the time but i fully support the process it's working here you've asked to remove uh items from the consent agenda and pull that into regular agenda i have no problem i have the same uh feeling basically um if we don't move this we're gonna get into quagmire where we just will never be able to move on with this agenda so i'm uh i'm for the man so agenda um thank you both for your support i i will have the last word here um not saying there's a conspiracy theory but as there is new information that came to my attention after our last budget meeting so uh i want to share that with the city and we can do with it what we wish um and i have some questions on some of this other stuff because it's the first time i'm seeing some of these contracts just to understand budget process okay and i describe this to someone today you all make a budget at home you budget for a vacation this year that doesn't mean you're going to france okay you might go and you might not you might have to stay home and paint the house there might be bad weather and you can't go you might have something come up that you can't do it it's in the budget the budget doesn't mean everything is rubber stamped go ahead and spend it it means we've set money aside for it and we're going to be talking about the approval of the budget later on tonight so this has nothing to do with the budget i don't want to interfere with these two things these are separate items we spent more time talking about it right now i could have probably ran through about every one of these and had them approved by now because i don't think there's going to be lengthy discussion on most of this but there may be some stuff that when people hear it it gives them pause and if it does then we'll come back and prove these things later that's all i want the opportunity to have full disclosure with everyone we don't hide the ball here yes i'm gonna play it mr gundam i i agree with the transparency and full disclosure and i will go back to my comments at the previous award session we spent more time discussing a 30-page sign of witness and then we spent 30 minutes talking about a budget when we could have spent the time talking about budget again so that's my point here is all of a sudden this is a dire consequence of getting focused in on and distracted by a possible supreme court case involving a side when we could have been discussing a 4 million budget of the city so it's you can stay here all night we have been we've been here one o'clock in the morning i will stay as long as anyone needs to stay i've got no place to go i've seen every coomer pile so i don't need to be home at nine o'clock to watch the reruns we'll stay here as long as it takes so don't ever say that we never tried to rush anything through because you have the floor anyone has the floor you've made 45 minute presentations sometimes on traffic and stuff we listen maybe we got in the first 10 minutes but you know what we listen you had the floor you put a lot of work into it we want to hear what you have to say this time sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get the point across to some people my point is is we did not take the time at the budget time to discuss it with you instead we we spent so much time talking about assignments everybody was weary and that's it that's that's call it a day declare victory and leave thank you any other council members okay i'm going to call the question one question all right this is to amend the agenda uh to move which items 12 through 16 including through 16 into the regular agenda uh do i have a motion oh you have to guess i already used to call it yeah call the question how do you can um how you can call it go ahead member banker yes councilwoman aye councilmember otero i will pass the gavel back to you sir i'll announce it for you past the seven to zero so if the manzo amendment or the manzo amendment amendment is uh passed item 12 through 16 will move straight in order onto the regular now with that we're still on approval of agenda does anybody have any other comments on the agenda citizens leslie and tara last word and i'll call the question as amended twice okay um i'll do a voice vote on this all in favor aye anyone opposed 7-0 the amended amended agenda is passed amen and we move to citizen comments this is item two so this is citizen comments and just uh for anyone who might be new any items that are not on the agenda you can comment on this is the time if there's something that's on the agenda we will get back to you later on and you'll have the opportunity to comment again on it so this is anything that is on your mind that we did not list on this agenda with that said um please come up here to the front podium give us your name and uh and give us the information you always come in in motion over here so you'll learn darrell will be first good evening um you're leaving over 113 12th street and i will have doreen's three gray and very great minutes in case i need it nine minutes total patty on june 7th um this year this board this council passed uh after much heated uh can i just ask you to speak right into that mic about it discussion uh you passed a worthless resolution stating that better beach is not part of a lawsuit that was founded by mr manzo and the interviewers i am one of the interviewers uh it was published in the newspaper and that big koopa was made about that to make sure that the world knew that belair beach was not part of this lawsuit yet a month later as a result of the freedom of information act i have it would before me some invoices from the attorney city attorney of federal shore which i will give to this uh clerk uh for your review and uh afterwards and of these invoices there are three entries that kind of trouble me although i think one may have been answered in our earlier discussion not as hinted at but these three entries really concern me the first entry is july 2nd it's a preparation of correspondence to beller beach regarding settlement negotiation and interlocal agreement now we mentioned interlocal agreement a little while ago and i'm going through the big thick packet to see if i can find out what exactly it means i have yet to see what it really means so i'm curious as to what is the change in the intra-local agreement but this particular [Music] entry i'd like to see what that letter was she prepared a correspondence to this city regarding not only the inter-local but also the law the settlement of the proposal settlement all right negotiation now this settlement negotiation only applies to the lawsuit does not apply to the city does not apply to anything else it's the lawsuit which the city has no business or interest in and whoever that party was negotiating with her which i think is the city manager based on the other two entries i want to know why because that person is not authorized to discuss lawsuit negotiation of that lawsuit any kind of settlement negotiation with the city of bellaire on july 14 there was a telephone conference with uh regina karnash and our city manager regarding settlement proposal what settlement proposal would that be during that time period is when the parties of the lawsuit had submitted a proposal to the city of ballard of the town of feller shore for consideration of the lawsuit so why city manager discussing settlement proposals of a lawsuit of which he's not part of and the city is not part of with the attorney of the town of elliot shore which by the way is not the attorney on the lawsuit all right there is another attorney she has no business discussing that either and then on july 22nd there's a third entry telephone call to bellar beach city manager now july 22nd is very important because that's either the day or the day after the town of bailey ashore decided to reject our proposal maybe the thumbs up was given i don't know but i want to know what that discussion was now concern is why is the city manager involved in this and either i'd like to have a really good reason or i'd like to have some reprimands because that you guys passed this resolution saying you're not part of this lawsuit and that means you stay out of the lawsuit you stay out of commenting of in negotiating or giving information about the lawsuit to the other party i'd like to see that better mr reeves the one that she's prepared for you also um mr daryl i'm going to hold time for a second point of order information are you making the public records requests for that item yes sir thank you i don't know that is a public records request time back in okay um to me this is a waste of our city manager's time and monies on items that are not in his job description which at the very minimum should require reimbursement to the city as a private citizen i'm sure he's free to talk to anyone just like all of you are free to talk to anyone about the lawsuit but when you're talking on behalf of the city after you pass that wonderful resolution there's a violation there somewhere and i like to have someone look into it and i do want to point out that it is the city manager's position sometimes to be contacted first for example this might be closely related to mr banker anyone asking for permission to park in our access lots be it film commission construction workers they'll come and they'll call the city manager first and i believe his response would be no you're not allowed or if he wants to make an exception for a particular [Music] issue or person or company then there should be a process by which that should be done an application a sign of waiver of liability for damages and accidents that can be caused plus a hefty fee for parking in our lots but no the city manager has been known to to respond i don't know call bella shore pass the book to bel air shore and let them do what they're not allowed to do because their ordinance specifically says they are not allowed to give permits and yet they consistently do and why because we have abdicated our responsibility to control the parking so i will give these invoices to this party for you to see i will ask for the freedom of information uh request on that letter and if anyone can tell me what this interlocal agreement discussion is about what does it mean because i haven't gone through the entire agenda yet so i would appreciate that thank you thank you mr darrell are you going to be here until the end tonight i will address most of this because it's not lost on me what you just said and there's plenty more beyond that so if you can stay and all of you can stay i'm going to open your eyes to some stuff that maybe you don't want to see a long time the resident brought up some issues that could be between tv i didn't want it's not i mean here's what we did mr banker last time we said um we had a discussion with tiffany so what our rule says is when a citizen comes forward we thank them we can refer it to the city manager so you currently have that option um or we can deal with it later on during our period of time or we don't have to deal with it at all last time we suspended the rules so that we could have discussions with the individual so that they don't have to wait till the end of the night that's what we did last council session so um you know if i'll entertain a motion if somebody wants to do that and we can discuss it well mr cass made a very good point at the last meeting when he did that to get these get the citizens and get the council members interjection back and forth while they're still here she said she may not be here so i'm making the motion that we opened it up i'm sorry my comment was to hear not to respond i never said that it was a back and forth it was more of a the citizens deserve the right to speak and to be heard they shouldn't have to wait till the very end of the meeting to be heard uh doesn't necessarily mean that i agree with i want a back and forth conversation every time someone speaks that's nice can you uh did you open it up for discussion last time we did open it up for discussion yeah is there anyone who wants the second mr banker's emotion open this up to have a we discussion now second now we have a discussion well i don't know if you want to get into this line i am because she knows hang on this is just to sell your idea of let's open this up so you can talk about opening it up some issues that are in 22b that are i think critical to the city and i think it should be discussed while everybody's here and i would like to say what i have to say right now i don't want people to trickle out of here when the reporters tape recorder runs out i want the reporter to hear what i have to say tonight about what happened a year ago with this city and the city manager i want you all to hear this anyone else on council yes i just have a question for the city attorney and the city manager i have no knowledge of these the first item that this rotaro brings up about the issue but when she uses the term interlocal agreement it does raise a question in my mind because who are the only people who can negotiate or discuss an interlocal agreement i mean in my mind it takes place between the council or the city manager or the city attorney between the municipalities not interveners or parties to a litigation so when you use a term an interlocal agreement that raises my interest well yeah there is invested interest in the city manager discussing an interlocal agreement with another municipality so i mean to me that's no surprise again i have no knowledge please allow me to finish sir claims around me to finish please the again the interlocal agreement of order this is about whether this is going to be put on as an agenda item to be a back and forth not a discussion of what your feeling is legally about an inter-local agreement which i might add has nothing to do with the one that ms rodero is talking about so let's stick to apples to apples this is a question of mr bangor councilmember bancard has made a motion to open up a two-way discussion yes or no we want a two-way discussion there'll be ample time to talk about whether your city manager did a good job or did a poor job that will be heard tonight whether it's hurt at midnight or it's hurt at seven o'clock it's going to be heard so please you have the floor to talk about the about whether mr banker should or should not get his wish that's all i want to hear about right now and i was just merely asking for a clarification of the issue for ms rodero before we proceed okay we'll move on anyone else on council citizens just on this motion back to council with frank bangard having the last word i believe we should uh while the citizens are in front of us they bring up some issues i believe we should have them back okay so the motion on the floor at this point from frank bancord is to open up a two-way dialogue between the citizens now we're not going to have the citizens come back up and back we're not that's not the way it works mr rodero said her point this council will respond to it that's that and the next person can come up and we will have back and forth with them during citizen comments and yes vote we'll make that happen a no vote will stick us to our regular stuff and we'll deal with it later on patty please call councilmember aggie aye councilmember banker aye council member guy aye councilmember ontario uh council member schwe aye two-way discussion now ms rodero you had a number of questions for this council allow me to knock one out real quickly because it's the easiest one we're using this inner local agreement um there's several interlocal agreements i can assure you the inter-local agreement you're familiar with as part of the lawsuit which has to deal with the arrangement between bel air shore and bella beach is not the inter-local agreement that's on the agenda for tonight okay that's actually an interlocal agreement between us and the pinellas um i think code board or pinellas building inspector to do building inspections and stuff for us so two different same term two different things and i'll bring it back to the council then if anyone else would like to respond um frank banker i know you had some items and i'm gonna bring some stuff up later well can i go absolutely on the floor all right the resident brought up construction morning lots uh parking on the lots and one of the things i wanted to bring up that passed in 22p was last thursday september 2nd i was going north on gulf forward about 9 00 am and notice at our 12th street lot two tractor trailers and 130 ton crane was parked in the lot all part using up more than one half of the lot on my way back the crane was being built right when i mean being built counter weights installed outrigger pads put on i'm a certified crane operator whole license is in other states so i'm not i understand cranes pretty well all right anyway so on my way back the crane was being built which was now improved 80 percent of our life all right for the insulation block removal maneuvering of trailers the access path to the beach was further blocked during the time which two residents and myself try to use now i have a question right quick are we discussing 22b now we're discussing what she brought up about construction i'm wondering if she brought up an agenda item and that's what i brought up well that's what i'm asking we're not supposed to be discussing agenda items during citizen comments okay so if you have other comments on her comments thank you dave i'll call that that was a point of order yes okay so i'm gonna find that well he's correct we are getting into 22. so let's keep that for later because i'll have the opportunity to comment specifically on that one um i know it's related um but this is specifically on the city manager's actions okay okay no problem any other council members okay then i'm gonna go um this is daryl i'm quite familiar with the documents that you have uh i've been going through the discovery and i'm not gonna be talking about my lawsuit but i am going to be talking about behavior and what's been going on over here um so on july 3rd lynn reeves wrote to regina kardash please call me at three one 727-229-8431 city council has tasked me to contact bel air to try and resolve all issues before the lawsuit i spoke i had spoken to your mayor and commissioner bloom just prior to the lawsuit looking forward to speaking with you then they go back and forth to kind of get a date and then you get what you got which was there was a conversation between them talking about the lawsuit and talking about settlements okay yeah that date was uh july 3rd was when he wrote the initial letter july 3rd 2021 yes correct okay so and i'm sorry i will specify the year because we're going to go back in here and then yes regina kardash's bills which i have okay um show that there's been ongoing discussion now why is that important folks i'll tell you why it's important i'm not going to tell you anything that's private i'm not going to tell you anything that i know that you don't i'm going to tell you what was said at the bellar store council meeting as part of our interlocal agreement signed by mike kelly when he was mayor and i don't know if mr reeves was on that board or not but the city council agrees to indemnify belarushore for all legal fees related to the beach access lots yeah so you're talking to the attorney that wants to build this city for their legal fees win or lose by the way folks win or lose not a smart move not a smart move but it gets so much better that's not all see we had all this talk that there was um there was a settlement in the offing remember that one yeah well i made a freedom of information act also known as the florida public records request i asked for everything that the city manager had relating to his settlement you know what i got i'll show it to you one calendar entry that he called mayor schmidt yeah that's the settlement that explains why we never heard from bellar shore because there was no settlement there's no paperwork there's no settlement there's no nothing but there's more folks this is like a batting for infomercial there's more a year ago this council i'm sorry the previous council when i was working with mayorship before july 21st when they had first passed the ordinance i called him because no one here knew how to get him i got him in 20 minutes and i got a moratorium on the enforcement of the umbrella ordinance for one month until july 21st 2020. there schmidt said let me talk to my counsel he's not a strong mayor neither am i and i said yeah god worked for our councils the city council here on july 6th said mr prior counsel said we don't want the mayor representing the city we want the city manager representing the city i wasn't thrilled with that it's not an attorney doesn't know the issues but you know what sometimes you've got to do what the council says so that's what the council said so let me tell you how your city manager represented your city and the individuals in this city i am reading now remember the meeting was july 21st 2020. he was tasked with reaching out to them on july 6th on july 16th he made a phone call i've got a letter right here patty this is going to be put into the i will give you a clean copy not highlighted tomorrow we will give a copy to every single uh uh council member we're gonna give a copy to every single citizen in this city i want you to hear what your city manager did barbara calucci city clerk of beller short wrote this to mayor robert schmidt july 16th 11 53 a.m subject july 21st meeting meeting request from lynn reeves hi in light of the current situation lynn reeves called this morning and wondered if it would be a good idea for our town attorney to clarify jurisdictional boundaries and municipalities being able to enforce ordinances to the war also clarification of not being able to lock the gates regina spoke to me about this already that would be regina kardash just wondering if this can be done at the meeting are you ready lynn believes that the facts will shut people up with what they are rabble-rousing about he sold your city no wonder why when we went there on july 21st they laughed at us a fix was in how dare you mr manzo again you're unprofessional and you know you're so the point of order is not well-founded i am asking this council to terminate you this is insubordination unprofessional you were sent over to defend the citizens of this city and you sold them out how dare you let's just bring it down to my dog okay leslie said opponent of order but we don't know i said what i had to say i'm allowed to raise my voice this is disgusting joe everybody take a deep breath let's just calm down who wants to speak next and on top of that you got the nerve to go in the newspaper and criticize me you thought that passed me by because i was out of town you talk about unprofessional do you can i maybe suggest a five-minute recess to all collect our thoughts and calm down and my clothes are fine i'm finished speaking i had said what i said citizen do you like that you still have the floor well we have back and forth with the only rigaro that's what i wanted to tell you so the citizens still have it you only still have time she sat down in the middle in the middle while we were debating i don't know how much time she has left patty you tell us how much time she has left i can talk to you but fast you can just put a mic on though um what you just referred to was a year ago prior to your resolution the me the entries that i referred to was this year so not only was the city manager interfering a year ago and i attended that bella shore meeting as well and i saw the interactions between all the commissioners and the mayor and mr reeves so i know what happened at that time as well but the entries that i brought up today happened this year when we submitted the lawsuit a proposal to see if we can settle this and obviously that interlocal agreement as you clarify was not the same as the one i am familiar with but the entry also mentions settlement negotiation proposal and i want to know what settlement negotiation is city manager having with the town of bella shores that is at all related to this lawsuit that you're not a part of and that makes me angry and i agree that he should be terminated because of us a member of this council whether you're elected or paid does not serve the citizens of this city then you don't deserve to be here and that means you're terminated in whatever way it happens resignation recall termination whatever i for one am very angry about this and i'm trying to really hold myself back there have been homes that i have learned that have not sold when they learned there was a lawsuit heavy that you couldn't open an umbrella on the beach that is the most absurd and ridiculous thing ever but nobody talks about the property values that are going down or will go down if this continues i for one may will make it my mission to tell everyone about problem values and realtors have been notified i tried to notify as many realtors because there have been deals that have fallen through and the story yo if you want to stay up in case anybody has any questions for you i'm going to have you going up and down counsel any response i would just like to respond since i've been retired i guess people might think i have anything to do but i've been going through all the minutes and listening to the audios of last year just for correction i think july 6 this council voted on point point play i'm sorry they have an ethical resolution done by balor shores meaning one that was done on july 20th i believe it was july 20th and you wanted an answer the council went in an answer back by the 21st um if it's all today okay and the city manager was directed to go to the bellaire shores and work this out with the umbrellas i'm just talking about the umbrellas all right i got this minutes and dollar shorts mean it's july 21st it's noted in august meaning where you attended and other council members attended and spoke that you always knew because nothing was resembled now frank if i might just it was july 21st and their meetings they may have put the wrong date on it but the meeting minutes are actually very very copious and very correct i haven't done it always okay but anyway um council seemed to be very strong in support of the residents here about their fellowship right and i don't know how it got wavered okay i don't i don't i wasn't on council at the time but i've been bringing up food issues okay which were removed by this city okay as unnecessary all right and just this past weekend we should have seen some of the in my opinion trumps running their boats 20 yards all right dangerous very dangerous now i talked to lynn i mean i actually made a resolution or propose the white resolution in june to have us pay for five bullies to put back and build our shorts at the bottom all right i got called in met with the city manager he says he believes he can work out two issues the umbrellas and the buoys give them some time mayor schmidt be out of town that was in june it was i think it was june 8th this year this year okay i gave him time i've been fighting with the fwc florida wildlife commission about these buildings because right in on the buoy perm there's 14 items if any of them are unsafe that they'll be the apartment has to be rebuilt all right i've given them videos pictures and everything i got a little bit leery when i didn't hear anything back i contacted the city manager in july all right apparently we never got a meeting with the bellerin's mayor but he did talk to balor shore's council as of two weeks ago i believe and i'm wrong lynn tell me all right and she said ella shores is not in a messy but putting the boobies back which compliments in my theory that let's make it as dangerous as hell out there for sun fading and swim okay but vice mayor rosemary on september 15th and this is noted in the minutes of dollar shares when discussing the money they were getting from the pinellas for our pennies for canal is about using that money for buildings this is the vice mayor saying hey we have a dangerous situation here let's put the movies back mayor schmidt then says well that money's already been allocated for other things so i have a real hard question to believe a couple things here that i've heard i've heard for the last year that if we only would have not filed a lawsuit or you interveners or whatever this would have all been worked out excuse my french they know me all right thank you all right that's exactly the word i need to use you all right because i would have been more candid than that okay because the fact of the matter is the abilities are a safety item it's like removing that bike down here because all right they weren't going to pay for it commissioner bloom says oh it costs a lot of money it's not going to cost you a dime we're going to pay for it now those lots which i read earlier are our lives bought and paid for i was also told oh you only paid a dollar you want to pay 10 bucks or whatever how much was manhattan paid for by the dutch they gave some trinkets and uh whatever right that i think the manhattan right now you have to pay 580 billion dollars all right those three lots are our lines this council needs to stand up and say hey we're putting a buoy at sixth street we're putting a buoy at 12th street there is a buoy already at 17th street and anybody that gets fined okay that has an umbrella on those lots we'll pick up the cab and we'll provide counsel okay because it's an unsafe item all right and waiting one more day okay because you don't know when skin cancer will attack you okay waiting one more day is not acceptable thank you council member and that is exactly the story we've been hearing for a year if you had waited and i filed your lawsuit we would have settled there are plenty of signs on fifth street on the lawns stop the lawsuit let's talk about  is too mild a word it is talking from both sides of your mouth you either are with the residents or you're not and if you're not then stay out of the way we'll take care of it but just stay out i don't care what i'm just trying to say is if you drop that lawsuit if you never filed that lawsuit i've dealt with governments in the last 20 years of my career and i'm talking about federal to state missing this about governments are famous for just pushing the agenda item and making you weary and tired and forget about it i've seen people when i've been here a little over seven years i've seen people in this audience i've seen people in this audience enjoy that upbeat for years and they stopped going i was also told i'm bringing up issues that really don't impact a lot of people okay i don't give a crap and that's another good word okay if you use the beach or not it's your right okay the last word on our town is bel air beach all right i want my taxes adjusted because i was told well you're taxed this council needs to stand up and reclaim those lots okay issuing permits and we'll get into this later my last comment if you allow me is that the the the problems on those lots especially the 12th street lot only benefit two people commissioner bloom and the new homeowner on the other side those are the only two people who benefit from that 12th street law putting in any cranes or trucks commissioner bloom thinks it's his personal parking lot for his cars and his trucks of his business those are the other ones the rest of the belair town of bel air shore does not benefit from those from using those spots thank you julie i want to play bs belair shore card okay or the bella or the barbra streisand card either way it's bs you're an attorney i'm an attorney leslie detero is an attorney and so does fred reilly an attorney you know damn well but the rule is that there's settlement negotiations they're not admissible as evidence don't tell me there was settlement negotiations ongoing i did what i had to do and so did uh debbie hall and rich shock we gave the notice of lawsuit to that city i waited an extra month and a half before filing the lawsuit to see if anyone was going to do anything they didn't have that decency to pick up a phone and call me and acknowledge my letter that's a fact that's a fact and why would they my city manager was out selling me out giving bad legal advice when he's not a lawyer telling them it's okay to enforce the law which they are not okay that's our city manager the great white hope that we set across the street to save our skin yeah great job buddy i'll give you a 50 point review this year you deserve to be fired and by the way what ms rodero said about this current information there was a resolution passed by david brought by danny daddy's past four to two in this council and it said in clear uncertain terms belarus beach is not a party to manzo versus belair short now we didn't need two hours to figure that out it was in paragraph two of my lawsuit but i guess nobody made it to paragraph two but hey you got to paragraph two it's in bellar sure bellar beach is not a party to this lawsuit and i don't represent bel air beach and i don't represent the citizens and i don't represent the council and i don't represent the city that's what it says go read and after that thing passed you use city phone city email city time and a city office to contact them to settle a lawsuit that was mine you don't work for me buddy you're not in my law firm don't represent me [Music] and it's defamatory for you to speak on my behalf how dare you who the hell do you think you are point of order granted this is a hostile uh work environment [Applause] let me give you a piece of law okay you are full of law yeah right and you're full of shitty attorneys [Music] he just said it's a hostile work environment that's what whiny guys said in december very good reason very good yeah really absolutely guys thank you guys for a minute come on down enough i'd like to say something okay are you going to say it after i explain mr dad is his law and his accusation joe bring it down okay calm down again you didn't learn this in computer school but i learned it in law school when you're sitting in this chamber and you're discussing legislative stuff what's known as legislative immunity i could say he's incompetent i could say he's corrupt and there's not a damn thing he can do about it because trust me if there was he would have been sued a long time ago for the he said about me all right that one up and we'll ask you see the attorney if i'm right can we all just calm down please yeah we'll calm down city attorney you want to say something well i want to say a lot of things the first one i will say is if you're going to entertain any sort of thing related to the city attorney the city clerk or the city manager my recommendation to you is to have it be an agenda item so that in a future meeting people can come and speak pro and con and you consider in lin's case and in my case there's a contract so it would be prudent for the city council if they're ever going to consider that not to do it on the spur of the moment but to have the contract in front of them so you could have some idea of what the ram applications would be if you ever make a change so that's the first thing second thing is i i've sat here for now two years and the hostility level is has increased throughout those two years and the there is a certain decorum that has to be present in a courtroom or in a uh local government meeting in order for people to effectively do the job that they're supposed to do the the young lady came forward and shared information with you and it in essence was information that relates to the city and city business and to me i sit here uh and listened because a lot of that was news to me i don't did not aware of it and i sat here and listened to it i listened as a professional and which is what somebody should do with being presented with that information if in lin's case i have to say on his behalf he has not said a word yet concerning the things that have been said and i don't know but my guess would be he didn't know this was coming up and it is an essence and a for one of a better phrase in a situation where he's blindsided by something that he was not aware of would be presented this weekend me saying that doesn't say a word about the merit of what was presented i don't know whether that's all correct or not i'm not taking any of it as being correct although it may be a thousand percent correct but y'all can't get things done because you can't hold a meeting without there being a tremendous hostility and it is extremely difficult to get the work done that needs to be done for the city so robin asked several times for a pause i would encourage you to take a few minutes of a break and vote then come back and focus on doing the work of the city commission council and go through the agenda and address the agenda items that's my suggestion and i'm not supposed to be the referee as a city attorney i've told that to you many many times and i i sit here thinking people are expecting me to jump in and pull the combatants apart y'all y'all earlier had an issue where frank asked to [Music] put something forward and that was a reasonable request and as i think robin said you are going to in good faith uh have what allow him to do that i mean in good faith let other people have a chance to talk and bring the the hostility level down because it doesn't make it easier to do these meetings it makes it substantially harder robin you want to make a motion i make a motion that we take a 5 or 10 minute break ten minute break second second discussion all right close have it break 7 13 we'll do it make it 7 30. okay easier okay we're back in on session at 7 30 back to citizen comments any other citizens like to address the council yes ma'am from here please so we can't hear you sorry we can barely hear it when the mic is working [Music] i just need your name and i'm darlene gray at 108 12th street um just to say i'm not a rabble browser point aboard didn't you give your minutes to uh yelling yes okay oh okay point of order is well founded then sorry okay yep sorry thank you very much yeah if you give the minutes away then you can't come on all right corrected thank you sorry about that all right any other citizen comments yes i first want to mention two things thank you for that mentioning taking a break because that was very much needed and i was on city council and i've been here since kathy mortensen was on city council so i'm a long time resident of bella beach council members do not always agree with one another and that's fine because you are all individual people but i've never seen such disrespect for other council members unless it goes that person's way and then it's well clapping it's not allowed but clapping is now around or attack attack attack it's not it's not kind it's not nice and it's not acceptable our attorney talked about decorum i mean this is bella beller beach is it has become and is continuing to become for the last two years a laughingstock it's a laughing stock at the big c meetings listen to people's conversations there and it's council member glenn then wanted to talk and you wouldn't let him talk because it was something that he disagreed with you don't always agree with when i was on council i brought it heads with with mr gunn and i told him when he got her console i said you know i respect you you turned my thinking around i was willing to have my thinking turned around i'm not so conceited to think that i am always the right one i'm just saying think about what you say but you know it's like i would tell my children when they were younger it's not what you said it's how you said it i've never seen such disgusting behavior by adults this is my last meeting i know mayor you'd be very happy with that but you know i'm just i mean some of you laughed i know it's funny it's downright laughable it's disgusting thank you any other citizen comments mr hansen john hanson 22nd street um it's been several months since council reviewed a contract for audio services upgrades for this room and council was somewhat unanimous in requesting that the city managed to go back out and rebid everything to include a few other things that weren't in the original specs to be bid on and i wonder if the city manager in his comments at this meeting will please give us an update as to where that process stands right now as of this meeting because we seem to continue to have a problem being the fact that you got to be within one inch directly in front of the microphone [Music] you know like i said it's been several months and i've heard nothing so if we could just get an update at this meeting did you want um remember we have an open dialogue not just on the one issue so dave gaddis i just heard him say that you could address this so if you'd like i'll have them speak with you right now please go ahead okay um mr uh reeves and i have been working with uh with two companies one company is the wiring company and the other company is on board they they are going to put in the multimedia equipment so so basically what's happened is the goal is to put patty's desk near that outlet there and then put the podium near that out there oh no it's the other way around okay the wiring is the issue with the way that the floor is okay encore has asked for a certain type of wiring it needs to be a certain distance has to be a certain depth in the floor and basically the wiring contractor has been tasked with finding something that will not tear up this room so we don't have to come in here with a jackhammer and basically kill the floor uh so it's not real uh easy to find what we're looking for but he is looking for it and i haven't heard from him lately have you it the wiring has been put in the audio visual first of it was 15 000 we went back and got the second bid it's and it was discussed at the budget meeting last month there's 36 thousand dollars set up in the next year's budget uh for the upgrades and after the council discussed that last month and we'll be doing the it's a big deal to do basically to do what we're trying to accomplish which is to make sure that everyone here can hear what we're doing people at home can look or see or hear what we're doing and if citizens want to comment either here or from their house we would like to be able to hear them that way also so it's not a real simple task it's very easy whenever it's one computer and you're sitting at your at your desktop at home but whenever you're trying to entertain a large group like this it's it's expensive it requires a lot of microphones uh it's it's it's a it's a big deal in fact uh the gentleman back there running the camera could probably testify that it's not that easy he wasn't paying attention but i would probably agree with has when you said the wiring has been put in on the floor already okay and that was the that was the hold up that that was the uh the hard part i think the rest of it was just securing the equipment that was a cheap part but that was the harder part i believe just finding the they just saw cut it i mean uh no no there's confidence in the floor we just had to make some changes to the brighter box lids that you see there we had to make some changes to that and pull some wire into that room and wire up the wall and uh it's been done uh i think it was like 700 not much yeah yeah well their initial bid was a lot higher for the wire thank you all thank you mr hansen anyone else good dancer that's right uh 7th street dollar beach i just want to say that if citizens want to talk out we talk about transparency we talk about sunshine laws and we post things in a timely manner so people have a chance to speak on issues but when the citizens are told or s or even spoke to or down to and called rubble rousers how does that make people want to speak out how does that make people want to come to these needs and when when did this council stop thinking about its citizens who voted them in and just remember if you want to be voted back in you need to start doing the work of the city and stop trying to appease other people thank you thank you [Music] any other citizen comments seeing a lot of hands on my close citizen comments we'll move through the presentation uh sheriff i said two sheriffs someone will make a presentation tonight yes sir okay please come up there sergeant sorry [Music] mayor commissioners thank you uh my name is randy sergeant randy hart um i'm not here with the beach i'm new to this city uh coming out here since the first time i've come through here um real quick your city is one of the safest in pinellas county uh the last actually in month of july he had five arrests two being simple batteries two being duis and one being ordered growling with a possession of control again one statement ellis county i really don't have much more to say but just keep up the good work with your citizens number one and i'm not sure if it was my copy i'll check with the other council members it looks like everything got cut off on the report that we got did anybody else get a full report where we have cutoff reports everybody's cut off okay so we need complete reports because mine ends at july 2020 here today i don't have a full um report so sheriff i'm sure you gave us one but i think in the duplication it must have gotten truncated or something here i have a question for you and by the way excellent job again um with keeping the crime rate low and that also i always compliment the citizens too because bear your eyes and ears on the on the ground and let you know when something's amiss i get and it's available to everyone it's nothing special that i get but pinellas county will send you crime reports any city that you want and i was looking at there's some crime reports for july 1st july 2nd july 20th two of them are domestic violence one is fraud and none of that appears on this report here does this report only show i'll say the heavier crimes and maybe uh knocks out some of the lesser ones is that how it works whatever is considered crime reports okay that's what the fbi is concerned about that's the major ones you're going to get delivered in that graph okay so i mean just so the citizens know it's still an excellent thing but you know in that month we had the way i was reported to me you have two domestic violences and one fraud so you know there is other stuff going on in the city just to be aware of and um you know but i don't think it changes anything here we still have a very good report so great job to you and everyone on the uh in the office and department all right thank you any other uh council comments any citizen questions for the sheriff thank you sheriff thank you for

modify the legal standards related to buildings and building regulations do i have a motion simulation second dave gaddis comments counsel starting with me to smoke now i'm going to go with councilmember banker's comment last time it says what it says okay any other comments by council citizen income i'm sorry i'm sorry frank becker i just want to reinterject section five uh port john's i think it's unnecessary language okay i'm with you frank this is you know we're asking people to hide a porta john good luck with that and if any of you are affected by it we'll have selective enforcement perhaps where you're told to put a portage on someplace where so you know the sun don't shine so good luck with that just to know i call them honey dippers can't get in there to clean the quarter giant out uh the guy will not set one there i guarantee you those men working will go to the bathroom and the last thing you want to do is move this to the edges of your property you leave it in the front by the roadway nobody smells it out there you bring it to the back corner everybody smells it so bad ordinance but anyway it's on second reading so that's my opinion i'm with you frank anybody else uh citizens get john hanson please john hanson 22nd street in this ordinance it says in part lawn and or landscape maintenance of any bills or property within the city should prohibited to 6 at 7 a.m weekdays so do you mind just citing the where exactly you're at so we can find it here on page 2 and section 2 at the very top of the proposed ordinance guess my main question is this i'm too cheap to hire a law service so you're telling me if this passes i can't cut my enter in my grasp on sunday well the way this reads it prohibits between the hours of 6 p.m and 7 a.m weekdays and sundays i get that and all day on sundays and the various holidays john i'll give you plenty of information here it says such prohibition shall not prevent property owner members of the property owners immediate family or anyone residing on the property from working on his or her property for construction remodeling alterations repairs general maintenance and lawn and or landscaping maintenance so long as such property owner or other authorized person as a force said complies with all other provisions of this code such as excessive noise or other nuisances so i think we're okay okay i just wanted to be sure is that every let's turn to the city attorney for clarification on that that's i shouldn't be making that that what this ordinance says this is a valid question i cut my law on some day i don't feel like getting a ticket i think the uh over a period of time you all changed this and the clarification was added about the property owner's immediate family so you would be able to do your own on okay sundays party owner and their immediate family can up their lawn do maintenance bank some mail let's do whatever they want to do it's the outside contractors that we're trying to stop oh i was clear about that okay i want to make sure you're quite you're is a trash day for us and you know that's the way i read it and okay the city attorney seems to agree so i think we're all right thank you okay thank you we have a co-enforcement person working on something um we can it's it's it's subject we're gonna actually talk about that uh i'm gonna i think we need to hone up how we're doing code enforcement here but um one of the whole reasons why we went to city um to the sheriff so that we had coverage on the weekends occasionally we don't want to advertise exactly when they're out there but yes the answer is yes they can be any other citizen comments i'll come back to council last words anyone give them a call question word it's 2106. oh patty before we do this

now a regular agenda this begins the regular agenda item 12 authorize the city manager authorize the city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021-22 this is to authorize the contract to pcso for law enforcement services it's a 522 thousand 72 dollar contract first emotion uh motion by slow second second second by dave gaddis i'll go ahead and turn it over to the city manager yes mayor console this is uh the annual contract for the sheriff services for next fiscal year we've discussed this in the budget work session and the cost and i'm recommending approval the contract was reviewed by the city attorney council i'll go this is what i want the citizens to hear our police services cost went up 3.6 this year nothing wrong with that that's actually a little bit below the cost of living but there has been a lot of discussion particularly with council member aki where i brought this up several times about the allocation to bel-air shore and guess what bel air shore police cost went down this year and i don't know why i heard it at a meeting there was no information given we know we've asked for computations on how this is uh how this is computed but i don't know why ours would go up and theirs would go down i'm not saying theirs is wrong i'm questioning is ours right so to the city manager you know the sheriff the sheriff computes that based on population that's that's what they've shared with me and the computation [Music] of course our population is at i think it's 60-25 and so whatever the population of belair shore was that's how they ended did we check it did we recompute this did we verify these numbers i verified them with captain liner just to double check to make sure that that's how it was done and he told me yes i'd like to see the computation i'd like to have that given to the council well actually a few months ago you were given that a budget hearing but i'll get you another problem because i wasn't aware theirs was going down that's what's news to me and that was at their meeting so my question is is our population we got a lot more houses here our population's going to go up they got about 58 houses we're going to keep going backward against them every year well i you know how the sheriff does it is by population that's how he does it is there any other options why don't they do it on calls or time spent i i i thought there was an email from captain liner explaining that you know there's some magic formula that calls number calls and contacts are in their magic forms i get to explain things yeah there was there was you asked for that information captain lioner got it and we had this discussion if we were going to do a separate contract and pay for a full-time deputy which we had this discussion right we decided against that and you decided against that and you know we don't personally compute what the sheriff does we are given what our contract numbers are and i provided he provides a worksheet which was given to you at one of the budget session it would be a lot helpful for approving the contract to have that even if you give it before in the budget which is this thick you know that we have that information supporting that contract rather than having to go through you know three inches four inches of paper i do remember seeing this paper coming through but i don't remember the computation i don't remember seeing you know how it actually wound up so not a problem that was my question so okay any other council comments right what's the alternative when we don't go with the share we have to store it on the case portion right you can either start your own or you can uh see if someone else would uh would do it for us the last time we tried that was me a couple of years ago i reached out to clearwater they weren't interested i think the only other closer ones that are nearby here would be bel air right now i don't think largo was close enough to make it work so um of course starting our own i think lynn had gotten a number and i independently computed it we were pretty darn close on the numbers and it was darn close to a million dollars to do our own over a million yeah so we're between a rock and heart kind of that's what you get when you display well when we disbanded the police department we were spending about between 650 and 700 000 and the first year the sheriff came here we were spending i want to say it was a little under 400 000. my point is that 3.6 isn't a heavy increase uh i don't i think there was one home torn down on balor assures that so their population might went down i think he was a winner do you know the percentage went down over there no what i recollected i'll i'll dig that out and send it to all of you but what i recollected was just a few numbers in our population with them all right citizens no citizen comments back to council any last words okay so item 12 authorize the city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for the fiscal year through 2021-2020 this is authorized the contract to pcso for law enforcement services five hundred twenty two thousand seventy two dollars for our share i'm gonna do this as a voice vote i believe that's okay correct patty okay all in favor aye anyone seven to zero contract is approved item 13 authorize the city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021-2022 mr authorized the contract to pcso code enforcement services motion please tell me to smoke second okay second dave gaddis rita i'll go ahead and turn it over to our city manager it's mayor council this is a request to execute the contract for fiscal year 20 21 to 22 at the rate of 49.80 per hour we have a budgeted amount of 52 000 for the sheriff's deputy will be here more uh more often and we will rotate to the question earlier uh some sundays and weekdays any other comments questions citizens counsel last word yeah i think i think these guys work too cheap you want to talk to your fop about it frank don't tell them okay any other cons all right item 13 authorize the city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021 through 2022 he has vote passes this all in favor aye aye anyone opposed seven zero passes item 14 execute uh authorized city manager to execute executive extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services explanation authorized an extension and a three percent increase of the mou with andrew tess cpa for accounting services motion [Music] yes uh this is a request to authorize the extension of the mou with the accounting services we currently use in their original agreement they they haven't stipulated a three percent increase that's all they're asking for and uh i think this has been very effective over the last two years that we've used them and it has been uh improvement in the accounting and budgeting plus save the city well over seventy thousand dollars total so this is a good thing you're very satisfied and i know i think everyone else working here is satisfied with their services correct yes we have no reason to bid this out at this point in time correct okay do we feel that this is a competitive price so i i do feel you know there's only a couple people that do this and we would have to go back uh we'd either have to go back to a person like we had or we'd have to try to find another company that might do it so i i think this is apparently you don't think i mean and i don't want to make a move necessarily just because of the cost savings when we're satisfied with somebody example when we talk about the garbage folks we pay them a little bit more than the others because they do excellent work i think i've always heard that these folks have done excellent work i have not heard anything to the contrary no no and if we call them and need something on a day that they're not here they'll either come here or we'll do it remotely so i think it's a good situation okay council any other comments citizens back to council it's an authorization for the city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services authorize an extension and a 3 increase of the mou with andrew test cpa for accounting services for the coming year the voice vote all in favor anyone opposed except zero passes that contract is approved understanding is approved item 15 authorize the city manager to execute an interlocal agreement with the building division of pinellas county building and development review services department authorized contract with county for permit services motion please submit as well second second yes uh this the new building official at pinellas county has asked for the interlocal agreements to be updated the only change to to our analytical agreement is that they will no longer participate in our variance uh requests or typically they were part of the court of adjustment uh that would be something that we'll have to do in-house or we'll use our engineer to do but other than that it's the same interlocal agreement that the last one was executed in 2015 and this is just a it they do all our building services permits and things so that was the question i had for you because i noticed at the very end i know in coming to the board of adjustment hearings they would always be here so who takes their place now we have to go out and pay for is that something that the person doing the application would pay for that engineer to come here well we would probably use who we're using for site plan engineering to to give us a comments so there would be a cost there but on the other hand the uh we charge a fee for a variant and i think i feel pretty comfortable that we can the amount of fee that we collect we can absorb that it's not going to be an excessive expense to it please monitor that if it becomes an issue come back and we will adjust the fee because we shouldn't lose on this and i did note that they you know because i remember the man used to be right here and you know he would he would give whatever advice was necessary now i guess there's nothing stopping since this is a quasi-judicial thing they could i guess if they really wanted to subpoena the person to come in but that's up to the applicant not up to us we don't need that person other than having an engineer could probably take their place is what you're saying right and and realistically in the past all all the county really did was verify that we'd already verified you know as an example if it was a doc permit it was x amount of feet you know they would come in and our site plan engineer would deny it and if it was closer than it was supposed to be and then [Music] uh we would just ask the county for their input on it to verify that we were following the ordinance correctly enough i don't think it's okay monitor just let us know if you you know if we lose on the first one we know and then we fix it the next time right easy enough any other comments and comments questions citizens any comments back to counsel any last words item 15 authorized the city manager to execute an interlocal agreement with the building division of pinellas county building and development review services department espo passes this all in favor aye aye anyone opposed 7-0 it passes that city manager you're authorized to proceed item 16 authorizes city managed to execute contract again for residential single-family multi-family residential complex solid waste collection services contract addendum with waste management inc of florida motion please tell me this second chapter thank you let's lean the tarot i'll go ahead and turn it over to the city city manager yes mayor council uh this is uh extension well the contract's there this is just an increase in charges to us we do not have to increase any fees for our residents will be able to absorb them into the current uh crash collection fee that we are in charge but they have an option in their contract that they can increase in four percent per year which uh there's some backup in here that shows you their calculations and also they have a if the tipping fees at pinellas county go up they can charge us a little more for that if they're tipping fees so what they've estimated the [Music] cost to be in the back if you look at it cpi index increase that they're asking for is the four percent which is the maximum even though the cpi changed 5.7 [Music] when we did this contract a couple years ago we negotiated that limit so it couldn't go above it a couple years ago the inflation rate so they didn't get any increase last year they did this year of course they're good authorized to do it so i i think the service has still been good and i don't think we have an issue with this man so i'd recommend approval contract dave so you did did you not absorb this last year we were able to absorb this without a rate increase i believe right yes now are you saying that you're going to be able to do that again this year fairly fair okay did you check i know the cpi numbers are cpi numbers that's from the government but do we do we i know we have an option of checking these tipping fees and dumping statistics do we have anything on that yeah the county sends that out to all cities when they increase the fees okay so that's comes directly from the county right okay so we're not taking waste management's word on it we're getting that from the county okay that's one that's one question so there's going to be their prices going up but the citizens should not see an increase excellent how can we not vote for that any council comments citizens frank you still think it's too low i'm just kidding okay all right uh any other last comments item 16 authorized city manager to execute contract addendum for residential single family multi-family residential complex solid waste collection services this is the contract addendum of waste management inc of florida uh yes beau passes this all in favor aye aye anyone opposed 7-0 passes city manager you're authorized to proceed okay back into the regular agenda now on to the taxes so we are item 17 that is this tax package here um consideration of adoption of proposed ad valorem millage rate for fy 2021 2022 this is the first public hearing on setting proposed final millage rate for fy 2021-2022 city manager there used to be a dialogue that i had to read where is it at the bottom of the memo 17 where it says the proposed military yes okay i'm reading that now no first we're getting a motion right yes okay motion please we just woke second yeah i would like to say with the staff's recommendation and we've all talked about this in the budget meetings i'm going to go ahead and say that we should stick with the 2.03 council looking for my page here right i've never voted for a tax increase and i'm not going to start this year this is a 7.5 increase in budget our cpi we just heard was 5.79 so why can't our city live within the same budget that the rest of the world lives in for those of you on social security but with john 1 you did not get a 7.5 increase last year let me give you a little history of how this city spends your money okay in 2013 our net revenue was one 733 seventy eight dollars two thousand fourteen eight hundred twenty four thousand eight seventy eight ninety seven two thousand fifteen eight hundred seventy six thousand seven sixty two thousand sixteen nine thirty three one ninety seven listen folks it keeps going up and up and up and up until this year it's at 1 million 250 1815 taxes have increased 70 spending has increased 70 since 2013 and none of your none of your wages increased like that none of your cost of living's increased like that anybody who gets any kind of kicker on to their social security or anything else didn't get that we play this game we play the shell game we keep your millage the same yes we do we have done that for 12 you know since 2013 and every year your property values has gone up now that's great i'm glad property values is going up but the property values is doing the dirty work this is a multiplication formula if you remember from third or fourth grade math okay a times b equals c well whether we keep whether you raise a or b you're still paying it in c and c is your taxes your taxes are going up it's the village that stays the same but your property values go up and the hall from this city like i say 2013 we ran the city with 733 000 now takes us a million 251 and what's really disappointing is that our friends in washington are sending us like eight hundred thousand dollars this year to use for our infrastructure so i don't want to hear that this is like for the you know gonna be to cover all these capital projects and if you forgot there was a stormwater fee tacked onto that garbage bill that you get every month okay that takes care of your storm order tax increase taxes spend taxes spend i'm not for it i'm not voting for it jody shirley used to be with me on this i hope there's others that will join me i'm not voting for this anyone else counsel i agree with you mr mayor uh the way florida works as you stay with the taxes or with the property versus you know your taxes i don't think there should be a need for any increase and that's called the rollback right so we have the option of going to the rollback rate which says we live with what we brought in last year and we make some strategic cuts maybe we don't buy that 56 000 signs we're outside maybe we don't piss away some of this money like we like to do frank bankert said we shouldn't be in the business of doing festivals you know what when we were doing them for free i had no problem with it but i joined him we shouldn't be spending thousands of dollars for this we're not in the entertainment business or a city not big enough to do this kind of stuff but if we can get sponsors then let's do it so i'm not voting for thank you mr banker anyone else i'm in support of keeping the military the same i mean we just discussed the 3.6 increase in the sheriff office contract to to think that the housing market is going to continue to increase obviously it's not that's the reality of the situation we have seen detrimental budgets here when the housing market decrease so if you rolled this thing back now because you're afraid of a tax increase how are you going to explain it when you do have to really increase taxes to cover the city expenses we spent three work sessions trying to trim the budget and you were there in all those discussions so i mean we're all duplicit in maybe not controlling those expenses to meet your expectations but the reality of the situation is our expenses are not frozen in time they're continuing to go up and to think that we can just freeze our revenues or roll them back and cover all the expenses i think it's up to the residents to be stakeholders and make this city continue to move forward and prosper and do the things we want to do and make it a premium city i am not in favor of ruling back this this military thank you if housing goes down like it did in 2008 then we can readdress it um i don't see a crash in the market coming within a year i believe our tax base is always a year behind anyway so here what's the average age of this town 58 57 55 okay a lot of retirees fixed income um i just don't i just don't support any type of tax increase you know you want to start cutting money it's kind of optional stuff how many of you all have a gas generator in your house i'll put my hand down i don't have one my lights go out we go dark we get high that's the way it goes we're going in here for a hundred plus thousand dollars there's a hundred grand here's your savings just hold back on spending that capital money there you go we don't even have to lay a person off we don't have to cut hours we don't have to take out the pencil and really sharpen it which we could do if we want to as a council okay we said we wouldn't increase the tax rate but today the rubber meets the road okay when we put the last budget hearing through we said the way things work whatever you tell the county you're locked into that and that's what you get on your trip notice that's the highest we can go so we can't go higher than the millage rate that we have here but we can go lower so i'm saying the lower listen um true we can't go over at the final budget here again september 20th we can't go if we go back to the rollback rate we can go below that but we can do this we can always go back lower later and i don't think it makes sense to do the rollback break at this point i've never done it that way before well this is exactly the same argument we had last year what we're doing is we're playing it safe this is the proposed military and it's uh better to be somewhere where we have a little bit of a safety net rather than to roll it back to a to a value that if something happens we can't dig out i just uh we have the same one every year we're not increasing your taxes your property value does go up we'll just wait and see what happens i beg to differ you are increasing taxes you're not increasing military but as i did the example a times b equals c a being the millage rate being the b being the value of your house your house values went up your taxes were going up unless you roll back the military that's the rollback rate we can come to the same number that we had last year but we don't want to uncle joe has given us 800 000 folks 800 000 to use for infrastructure and storm water you hear anybody up here talking about like knocking off your stonewater fee we can do that like i don't hear so i want to hear from the council and i want to hear from the citizens your taxes are going up listen it's not going to break you okay it's another 10 15 bucks whatever it's going to be for the basic house and the higher nicer houses are going to pay a little bit more but it's going up every year folks every darn year that's inspired i'm tired of it i'm not voting for it yes sir well that just before just one second we had no other council comments mayor council run scanning drive i just want to remind you i was part of the citizen finance committee and you spend a lot of time digging deep into the finances of the city i started our support holding the military the same i think a lot of actions of the city's taken such as increasing the fees of the marina for the rental charges have gone up it's just the natural thing that costs are going to go up so i've been protecting this uh nobody playing for your uncle joe uh gift and so let's use that as a gift and and and soccer use it for the infrastructure and if we save money we've gotten into reserves over the last few years so i'd recommend keeping it where it is let's remind everybody the county did roll back their rate so it's probably a net offset so it's a flat for the whole between what the county's given up and what world will do for that so that's my position thank you citizens any other comments yes sir thank you jeff keith harborgrove i keep hearing about this value increase and i look at my uh new assessment and it comes up 100 grand less than last year does anybody else see anything like that a lot of it has to do with what uh your neighbors are doing that's that your property value is adjusted accordingly it's just we get this from the tax collector and the tax properties appraised for the beginning of the year we look at the whole city not each individual house so yours might have went down up down somebody else's went up perhaps there was a change or something incorrect it's based on your individual assessment but overall the cities went higher so yours will probably go your tax will probably go down but don't tell them question because the taxes won't go down because it's a recapture on homestead well so they don't go down regardless of of the value going up or our values keep rising whether we raise the millage or not so my taxes will go up the value went down that's my point you're correct you're there's a safer homes cap and you have it's limited to three three percent every year so we've been getting increases of four percent five percent six percent if you've been here for some time which i think you have you're proper you've you're under and so am i so i've been here for a while and so a lot of people lived here and even if even if the property values went down like if the market crashed you still could be going up for a little while until you get equilibrium so right yes the line's going down now i'm going up but that's that's just the point uh i saw my property go down 50 from the time i bought it and then came up well above that so okay thanks nope you're correct on that yes sir in the ultimate tax in and of itself is not necessarily the point i think the point is we should be within our needs why should we keep on looking at getting more money into the city just to spend it and i know there are projects that need to be done there are services that need to be provided um but at the same time the mindset should be to the brain valley why should go on enough all the time i come from sweden i've heard under very high taxes same things happen over there and you don't get one back you give to the government there's an inefficiency there so i want to keep my money and make choices on my own i understand that we live in a community we need to help each other there are certain services that we need to provide thank you any other citizen comments saying no other hands i'll close it some comments and bring it back to council for final comments right how much money did we use to get in those beach lots from fines and revenues that we're not getting now it i couldn't give you a specific number because at the time that they were doing that uh a lot of those tickets were being sent to the sheriff's office we didn't take that in-house till i was here like a year and i said i'm not getting any money from parking tickets and i said i'll just collect them like ourselves and but you know it was i think we did a study but i i don't recollect the number 5 000 or 1500 bucks that we could have got cancel any other comments yes yes when the the portion of the taxes that you pay on property correctly but my understanding is only 12 of the property taxes paid that you pay on your home goes to the city of our beach everything else goes to the county okay so only 12 comes back to the scene now we talk about the increases of our home values and that's that's taking place and that's a good thing but i think it's narrow minded to think that that's just because of whatever you're doing on your property is increasing those property values i think you are a stakeholder in making this a prosperous desirable city to live in and that's what's driving the property values here so i think it's incumbent upon everybody to take be a stakeholder and be a better share in that and to think that we can just enjoy the increases in property values and not have to pay out or address the expenses again i go back to the duplicity of this council we've had three budget work sessions and we had our opportunity to trim those expenses and here we are and i get once again we're just talking about children and nurturing i don't agree with that i still don't know what's ironic we heard that the county is using the rollback right county figured out how to do it anybody think pinellas county is not a well-run county got all kinds of problems with it tell you what canelo's county runs pretty darn good particularly when you compare it against the other counties they do a darn good job in fact every month at the mayor's council meeting there's a county commissioner and almost unanimously and this is hard to get all mayors to agree on anything there's compliments and it's not a political thing because sometimes it's democrats sometimes it's a republican it doesn't seem to matter everybody's pretty satisfied with the work that's happening with the county that goes to the board of ed too they've been doing a really good job the education department so um they figured out how to do it we can figure out how to do it we cut this thing on one night if we have to so i don't bet by that we can't go back and fix this we can fix it right now are there other municipalities rolling back there another great example i i don't believe so what i've read in the newspaper very few if any okay any other council comments and let's call the question and uh we're going to do this by roll i want this recorded um so this is consideration of adoption of the pro-proposed ad valorem millage rate for fy 2021 through 2022 now in you want me to read that little no no the the staff just where it says recommendation yeah that's what you agree i mean your staff recognize yeah okay so here's what i have to add the proposed millage rate of 2.0394 mills which is higher than the rolled back rate by 7.04 is to fund the expenses of the general fund for the fiscal year commencing october 1st 2021 and ending september 30th 2022. the final approved millage rate for the city of bel air beach will be presented at a second and final public hearing that will be held on monday september 20th 2021 at 5 05 pm we're now calling the question a yes vote gets you the 2.03 millage rate with the property values as the tax assessor determined them how do you generate your chair yeah just for clarification that 2.0394 is the current notation that is correct and the rollback rate would be 7.04 lower than that so that's what we're debating right now the proposal is to adopt the 2.0394 current village rate not the rollback rate taxes are going up if you adopt this rate overall for the city okay yes is it too late to debate other questions i just called the question i mean well i'm not going to recall the question the idea would be can we split the baby take that 0.7 roll back we could um or does it have to go no this is the session i mean you can make an alternate proposal if you want we're ready to call this question that's too late nope not yet well yeah i'm going to talk to the city i just called the question all right and we haven't voted yet he ended debate he just pulled the question now he's asking if he can make an amendment i don't know that he can at this point just hold the question he called the question that you should now procedurally go to the votes i thought if it fails then you can now consider what to do next absolutely okay so patty gentry does anybody want me to reread any of this we're clear this is important patty [Music] no council member bakery no council no so four to three it passes first reading uh our first um hearing second hearing will be september 20th 2021 at 505 pm if it passes then that will be the tax break move to item 18. wait wait a minute the according to the memo it says upon adoption the motion the mayor will announce and that that's where you have to read the announcement which is the language involved just read that before we call it you need to read it after it's adopted also okay all right proposed military of 2.0394 mills which is higher than the rollback rate by 7.04 is to fund the expenses of the general fund for the fiscal year commencing october 1st 2021 ending september 30th 2022. final approved village rate for the city of delaware beach will be presented a second and final budget hearing that will be held on monday september 20th 2021 at 505 pm yes that concludes this okay item 18. consideration of approval approving the city of bel air beach budget making for certain expenditures expenses capital improvements and serving indebtedness for the year beginning october 1st 2021 and ending september 30th 2022. this is the submittal of the proposed budget first of motion leslie terrell makes that motion second second second three to swell leslie i will turn it over to city manager city managers yes uh mayor this is the budget that we discussed at three different uh budget work sessions and you had some revisions of the july 19th and august 16th and i'll just highlight those uh we increase contractual service with the sheriff for 52 000 we decreased staff and code enforcement by 39 620 we increased the audio visual upgrade six thousand dollars to make it a total of 36 000 in capital projects uh may increase the generator 40 000 increased property and liability insurance 4 100 in non-departmental decreased personnel services of non-departmental 22 392. deleting the part-time administrative assistant we increased the insurance and the marina fund of 600 and we changed the stormwater fund as follows the increased stormwater expense a hundred thousand dollars for that mandated state bill house bill 53 that we'll have to put out to bid the effect of all these changes for the budget your fy20 2122 consisting of five million ninety three thousand three hundred thirty dollars two million eight hundred and nineteen thousand three hundred thirty dollars eighty six thousand six hundred and eighty dollars in the marina fund 594 dollars and 594 130 in the stormwater fund and 1 593 190 in the capital projects fund just to clarify that large number of the capital project there that is it's budgeted because it's the pinellas penny per canals money that's for the boulevard underground which is 900 000 of that so that number's uh so staff respectfully request that the city council approve the 2122 budget including the capital plan a copy the budget was providing you with the changes attached for your view the florida department of revenue requires specific language and procedures when improving the budget so i got it right there we're only going to read it once this time though because it looks like i only have to do it after the motion which makes no sense but we should do it before um okay council comments first starting um so i'm sorry council comments it's open i think it's pretty clear in the budget we've gone over it multiple times at multiple hearings and i think lynn's put a good description in here what the changes are i think we should approve it as as presented counsel again i can't support this okay because support this is to support the tax increase i'm not going to support the tax increase i'm not going to support this budget um now that it's so wrong but it can be tighter and uh so i'll be voting for this one any other council comments citizens no citizen comments back to council last word leslie in a tarot if she wants one please vote for it okay you got it

council providing for incorporation of recitals providing for approval of an amendment to section 2-63-d of the city code of ordinances providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for severability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date this is to allow discussion of pending litigation and perspective litigation you'll have a motion so literature by david gatt a second second second by reader uh dave um how on earth are we rehashing section 2-63 in january fred reilly went into great detail to explain how section 2-63 legally protects our city and how we already are able to address prospective impending litigation state of florida recognized that its sunshine law was problematic for elected officials concerned for litigation to address the problem the florida legislature amended the sunshine law to allow government bodies to meet in private to discuss pending litigation in january fred riley detailed the shade meeting process and how it is used to discuss pending litigation if you recall we recently had a shade meeting to discuss pending litigation section 2-63 was never mentioned and the meeting was held without ever being challenged in january mr riley also told us exactly why section 2-63 was put into place he made it very clear that discussing any litigation in public meetings is dangerous why would any council member want to put this city in danger from a constitutional perspective most would agree that as citizens sections 2-section 2-63 travels on our first amendment rights as council members however is free speech from the dais in the city's best interest when dealing with perspective or pending litigation i would say that it is not as elected officials we must hold ourselves to a higher standard florida sunshine law expects it and our code ordinances expects it back in january our city attorney conveyed that same message of holding us to a higher standard he said that as council members we had an obligation to protect the interest of the city as you may know this debate over section 2-63 was recently sparked back to life when a council member attempted to create a resolution based around current ending litigation in the city's best interest section 2-63 prevented the resolution from ever making it to the council for debate it did its job so how do we handle prospective litigation the drafters of section 2-63 realize that discussions of prospective litigation in public meetings could also be perilous mr reilly told us how he handles prospective litigation simply by contacting each of us individually with the same details and recommended courses of action allowing discussions of prospective opinion litigation in public meetings can have devastating effects on our city and council with little or no warning a council member may not realize that he or she has been baited to say the wrong thing until after the words have been spoken by then it's too late as mr reilly has implied section 2-63 was designed to protect us from ourselves therefore this rule should remain as it is currently written it gives the city attorney and the chair full authority to rule out of order when necessary which prevents the possibility of admissions against interest as council members we are obligated to protect our city section 2-63 was added years ago for that very reason to protect our city today i'm asking each of you to do what is best for our city by voting no on this ordinance thank you so when it's in the city's interest to stifle first amendment rights that's okay this city just doesn't learn does it didn't i read you twice federal constitutional law section 1983. didn't four of you get that mailed right to your house and a bunch of other people in the city see it [Music] just because it's convenient or the city doesn't like what might be said you don't lose your first amendment rights when you become an elected official period no exception now if you're so darn concerned about declarations against interest why don't you deal with the city employees i'm not going to talk about lawsuit i'm going to read what was in the newspaper flynn race he stressed however that the city council members were within their right to essentially fire van scoy she took the position on the parksport and acted like she was a city employee then she tried to use her position to get people who worked in another city to be fired that's not what you do reeves said race the city manager never went to law school who doesn't speak for the city just made a damn declaration against interest that buried this city and you people who are in this lawsuit should be screaming right now because he did not help your case by saying that he's factually wrong and he's legally wrong that's all we'll talk about i brought a motion [Music] and i'll tell you what the motion was about the motion was to have the three people that were on this council glenn gunn david davis and ris hope voluntarily resigned we can't force you to resign it was a motion to ask the people to resign and i was stopped from bringing it my first amendment rights were trampled 1983. sound familiar you're going to get a second suit out of your first lawsuit if you keep it up this was a compromise that's what this was and i said it last time and it's in the minutes that we just passed through paddy this was a compromise for me to withdraw that motion to allow the city to allow the elected officials [Music] not to have to deal with an unconstitutional law they talk about this all we want you can't enforce this law but in the interest of having sanity and having meetings that run right we want to get this right now with regard to the shade meeting that was an illegal meeting city attorney didn't say anything about it i didn't really realize that until later on this we shouldn't have had the shady because the rule says you're not allowed to discuss litigation period meeting sure the state says you can do this in the shade and by that i mean we all get together we dismiss everyone from here we bring a court reporter in there's a record taken of what we said but it doesn't become evidence until after the case is settled or tried it allows the council to settle cases it allows the council to determine strategy as a matter of fact with this declaration against interest i'm going to be asking for a shade meeting so that we can go over proper strategy for our employees i want the two attorneys to come here and explain why we shouldn't be making statements like this because it's detrimental to our city don't tell me i'm trying to help june this doesn't help june wounded mayor can i say a few comments when i'm finished you can sure okay but right now i have the floor i'll recognize you as soon as i finish okay this was a compromise if you want to change your law that's unconstitutional change it if you want to vote it down that's fine you do what you do and i'll do what i do but i know my motion didn't get hurt it got shot down before it ever saw the light of day and for the record city manager had no problem with that city attorney told me that i would possibly be facing charges well i can't as an attorney be facing charges so i can't do the civil disobedience thing i wish i could but i can but there's other ways to take care of this you stop me from talking that you don't get to do not if it benefits the city not if it hurts the city you don't stop your city manager from talking [Music] i urge you to pass this and as i said i am a man of my word i will drop the um motion i don't intend to bring that motion this was a compromise but i want this law fixed you don't want to fix it no problem no problem fred robin well there will be a problem but no problem no problem tonight mr rhymes okay well i'll make several comments one one is i sit here and listen and i uh purposely don't interrupt elected officials because it's my understanding that elected officials need to have as long as it's a sunshine meeting the opportunity to say things to each other and i don't prejudge what y'all are going to say to each other that's the reason why i don't interrupt people constantly and as i've told you many times that's not my role my role is not to sit here and be the referee for the seven of you that's up to y'all the again at times i i don't know what to do with this group of people it is the attorney i'll say a few things one today the current law is in effect so i would suggest to the council you shouldn't discuss any penny pending litigation so that's a blanket statement if you choose to ignore it then that's up to you but i strongly encourage you to not discuss pending litigation so that that's one foundation point the other thing is i can give a long detailed explanation of the mem or the the resolution that i was asked to draft but i'm not going to do that i'm going i wrote a lengthy email if you want to know what that was all about you can read the email it's a public record the short version of the resolution is that it did ask for people to resign and i presented in the email which was a legal opinion why i recommended that the person that asked for that resolution reconsider it and i did that consistent with the florida bar rule that i'm supposed to to apply and i applied it i've mentioned the rule numerous times it's in the email i don't know the number off the top of my head but it it is a very important rule and i followed it to the the t lynn did not step in and do anything other than talk to me about the resolution that i was asked to prepare i dutifully prepared it and then i presented it to the person that asked for it to be prepared and i presented it to lynn and gave my recommendation on this is something that i recommend you reconsider subsequent to that there was a discussion about amending the city code and i prepared an amendment which you have before you and the amendment to the city code is to clarify something so there is no mistaking what uh whether you're complying with florida law or not and to me this was a good solution because it addressed a problem i at that time when i prepared this this ordinance i said there's a far easier way to solve this issue it's to make sure that the city code provision is absolutely consistent with florida law that's what i did so getting off the deep end in the constitutional issues i'm not going to say those are don't matter they certainly do matter but i'm saying i wrote this so that you had a simple straightforward way to address the problem and make sure you're acting consistent with florida law and that's what i did i did not go into extended analysis related to constitutional law issues because i felt this was a far more direct and simple way to address a problem so that's what i did in addition with respect to prospective litigation i i still have serious concerns about that but i drafted language that i thought would give the city council some parameters so that if you ever had a situation that the city council needed to talk about a potential lawsuit you would have at least some basis to do that so that's that's where this lies um dutifully impressed with vice mayor gaddis's research on all the things that i said it sounds like i did a pretty good job but to me this is a reasonable thing to consider and i think it's a something that the city council should consider and i'll certainly stand for any questions that you may have questions for fred riley and then we'll come back to general discussion questions [Music] so mr riley you're comfortable with section two d and their whole entire words as the new version yes yes okay read that slope so you're comfortable with the new version but yet you are recommending we do not discuss opinion renegation of which i don't feel like we should either another concern i would have is what if it's one of the council members uh family or significant other or whomever is the one following the lawsuit and then we're going to sit up here and award them the money that that would definitely might be a conflict of interest and i also don't know off the top of my head nor would i because that you incurred to work on that resolution when you simply couldn't just ask because i would have told you no i will not voluntarily resign and you could have saved the city tournament's time energy and the taxpayers of the city but that would be a sunshine violation rita and you know it nice try i did the same thing that i've done other times i asked lynn what is the procedure you followed in the past and him and i talked about the the resolution that one of the council members asked to have pro or not resolution in this case ordinance no i'm sorry about the resolution and i did what i would after discussing it with lynn did what i was asked to do and then i went the extra step and also did what i'm obligated to do ethically which is address the ethical rule that i did address and that i will tell you took considerably longer because i you know meticulously went through the process of analyzing that and putting it on paper so that i was at the legal position i was taking was absolutely sound and it is absolutely sound i just have one more comment uh you made the statement uh mayor that would have been a sunshine law violation i don't see how it would have been if you probably would have stated it you know in a city council meeting i wasn't intending for you to ask me because i definitely would not have had that conversation but i just wanted to make sure that general public realized that i that i met in this room that you were publicly stated better clarification no problem and that's not the appropriate way of dealing with such a request we deal within the resolution and i have a right to bring a resolution we talked about a resolution that was brought earlier that could have been avoided by reading second paragraph from my lawsuit we spent an hour and a half doing it so i have every right to bring a motion and a resolution and this was for the city's protection folks this wasn't to punish anybody this is the city's protection i sit here and i hear comments made one camera two cameras three cameras recording everything that's being said where do you think those tapes are winding up you've made declarations against interest you didn't even know it you don't even realize it sometimes when you say something not you i'm talking about the council in general it'll all come out i'm sure at the appropriate time and let's clarify something i'm not the attorney on this case so stop anyone intimating that because i don't appreciate it it's not my lawsuit i'm actually trying to help this city right now and save me from making more bad law and bad rules this was a compromise if the council wants to go for it that's fine if they want to reject it i'm fine with [Music] and then we will get a ruling as to whether your existing law is good or not good i promise you that i um i now that i've looked through it i would be willing to uh vote for this uh provided that we only added the the shade meeting portion of it i think that we have no business discussion uh pending or perspective litigation can i explain to you why that's in there i would like to keep it that way let me explain to you why that's in there okay you said that fred can talk with all of us there's actually an issue if he talks with all of us and comes up with a decision there's actually a bridging potential for that which is a sunshine violation the reason why that is in there with his warning and doesn't mean we have to do it we had this happen not too long ago this is concluded litigation so we'll talk about it we had a slip and fall at morgan street we got notice and as i recall it was a very comprehensive notice of lawsuit it was incredible i've never seen one so well put together it had code provisions it had state law provisions about drainage and the showers and everything else and we got it [Music] and instead of heading this off before it got to a lawsuit the whole reason the state gives you six months of time between notice of lawsuit for a tort claim and the actual bringing of the suit is so that you can do something about it we sit here and do nothing because we don't want to talk about it because it's going to go away well it doesn't go away it goes to court it goes to trial and when you go to trial the price of poker goes higher because the lawyer has to work more actually i believe that that case went directly to our insurance company is that correct well what i was about to say is when a case a notice of a case like the slip and poll case comes in the city has insurance for that and lynn notifies me of the the fact that we got a claim letter and then lynn ships the claim letter to the insurer and the insurer assigns uh claims counsel and claims council evaluates the claim at that point and that that's something is done and that's that's exactly the track that follows and the reason why is at that point i do nothing i other than if the claims council calls me i certainly take the phone call or if he calls lynn lynn takes the phone call and gives him additional information related to to them evaluating the claim and that that's the track that's followed right and the reason why we actually proved this whenever we did have a shave meeting we discussed it we made a decision and the insurance company did what does everyone remember they came back and said this is none of their business we're paying this and we control how much we're paying and no matter what we voted on if you recall almost everyone said we're not paying we're gonna fight to the end on this and what what happened the insurance company came back about three four days later and said you can't do that we're the ones that are paying the claim and will handle it so a majority of our lawsuits the the whatever comes in where does it go to does it go to our insurance most of the time we're we're notified we're not in the dark we always get we always we get all the details as soon as we're notified it all comes to us we just don't discuss it because at the end of the day um the insurance company they have the the they have the final say so you know and i followed up on that question because i said all right well why do we bother to have your shade i mean the response from the florida league cities it's not a necessity it's the you allow the decision of the insurance company to make the decision so you can make whatever you put you want in the shade being at the end of the day it boils down to what those insurance companies want to do and if you decide beforehand you want to take some action the insurance company may back off completely and say it's yours now you own it so i mean we have the florida league of cities coverage on this thing okay can i just continue with my comments thank you if dave is i'm okay this ordinance change is not in the best interest of the city nor in the best interest of the council as a whole and i don't support this thing either the current ordinance works you know it could probably be tweaked to come in alignment with the florida statute just by designating which which section of the florist connections we want to comply with intending litigation and to be able to have a shade meeting but ultimately it worked for us that time we had the meeting there weren't any major repercussions and as we found out at the end of the day it's a decision by an insurance company it's not it's not a council decision and if you decide to go a different way the insurance company backs off in the florida league season says it's your ballgame from here on out and you incur all the costs of it these things are covered by the florida legal cities insurance i mean we didn't pay any legal fees for that we didn't pay any penalties or settlements for that thing to discuss prospective litigation i don't foresee any upside to that it's a distraction uh when it reaches the painting stage and it's current litigation fine then let's go ahead and start thinking about complying with the florida statutes and have a shade need to discuss the issues and maybe make our recommendation to the insurance company florida legal cities but other than that it's just a distraction and a waste of valuable time until it becomes a real issue where we are designated partners to this thing is saying the declarations on missions against interest that's the very real thing and i reached out to the florida league of cities attorney whose represents municipalities in these litigations against the cities and lawsuits against the cities he's vetted by the foreign league cities he has their full trust and confidence in dealing with these things and he makes a living at dealing with the litigations and lawsuits against cities and his unqualified opinion was don't do this don't do this admission against interest you can have your city attorney give you warnings and concerns all day long but at the end of the day all it takes is a utterance or a slip of the tongue to hold something against you in court and his based on his experience and opinion working with lawsuit and the former leader cities represented municipalities in this thing is a lot of council members and a lot of even municipal attorneys aren't familiar with some of the issues involved in admissions against interest at the end of the day the only people who decide what is an admission against interest is a judge and a jury so all the warnings in the world won't stop us look at the tower and otherwise against our interests and while we may be spurt bespoke reputation of some of these florida league cities attorneys they make their living doing this and dealing with it every day given the current climate of litigation and stuff this is not in our best interest i i think it i don't want to provide a microphone for more lectures or more espousing opinions on this thing and as you can see and everything else we deal with we have rampant emotions flying here and that's where you have run into the danger of utterances or slips of the tongue that can be held against us so at the end of the day there's no upside to this thing pending litigation no problem if you want like the mayor suggested that burning alignment with the uh designated in the florida league of statute uh 286.011 but i am dead set against discussing any perspective and litigation it's a distraction and there's no need to enter absolutely no value-added or upside to you that's all i have thank you and he put the following in the record verbatim quote i'm going to read something in and i'm going to i'm done talking about this okay is my legal opinion that section 2-63 of our city code is unconstitutional and in violation of federal section 1983 which states every person who under color of any statute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory of or the district of columbia subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to be to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitutional laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit inequity or other proper procedure for redress except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken such officers judicial capacity injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory degree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable end quote that ends my comment on that your law is unconstitutional i gave you an offer take it or leave it you have the law in front of you you have a city attorney who told you there's constitutional issues ask him his opinion i wanted to make a motion and i wasn't allowed to talk and i'll be damned if it's for the city's convenience that you get to shop an elected official you think that's constitutional let's try it let's try who's up mr ryan i wanted to clarify that the comment that glenn made just just to be clear the shade meeting that is authorized by 286.0118 is only for pending litigation so you can't use that for perspective with the questions you went back and forth between the two a couple times so i just want to make that that clear the second sentence about discussing prospective litigation [Music] the way it was written was the city council made and that is permissible that doesn't mean you have to do it it means you can refrain from it oh it'll happen it'll happen if we vote for this it'll happen i can assure you that's exactly why it's put in here so that it will happen okay well i agree with that i i'm writing the the proposed draft of the law in the best way i can to be responsive to what i was asked to do that's what i did i didn't say shout out to you i appreciate it let me finish my sentence my my advice to you is do not discuss pending litigation and refrain from doing it in a public forum and i'm not saying you can't do it i'm saying the more prudent action to take is not to do it and i'm not suggesting that anybody's constitutional rights be infringed there's there's times you you have every right to do something yet you refrain from doing it because there's a better way of doing it or there's something that you should consider other than the fact that you have a right to do it so you know again i i did what i was asked to do i prepared a draft of this if you all want to change it then please tell me how you want to change it if you don't want to change it then you can leave the code provision the way it is as i stated earlier i will be more than happy to answer the statement about the shade provisions but as far as perspective litigation i would i would prefer to leave it alone you have every right to make the amendment that is not my deal with this city so make the amendment if you wish that we have a deal there is no deal i'm making a deal i made a deal with the city and i and if you and if this is the ordinance that we crafted that was a compromise and if people don't want to compromise contest your law i will put it to the test guaranteed mayor i i wrote the ordinance i was asked to write i am i'm not criticizing you i'm not i'm not saying you're criticizing me i i did what i was asked to do and you know as well as everybody else in this room it has to be presented in a city commission meeting i understand so i have what it's doing and the city council members are debating it that's what they should do they have different points of view we're having today i do have a question uh currently um with prospective litigation it's not supposed to be discussed in a council meeting what happens if a council member brings up that prospective litigation just just like what's happening right now how does that apply with our current city code well it's been brought up tonight and according to the city code provision as it exists today i did what exactly what i was supposed to do and pointed out that that shouldn't be discussed further but i i'm the lawyer for this group of people and my i give you legal advice and if you choose not to follow it then you some potentially suffer the consequence if you make a misstep and i'll be the first to sit here and tell you i don't have a lock on wisdom so occasionally i may be wrong but on this one i i've done exactly what the code asks or says i should be doing correct and my question is okay if we all decide to follow the rules of 2-63 but one of us is the one threatening litigation but what happens is is that person in violation because they're the one threatening us with litigation because if that's not allowed to threaten because if that's the case then we that we've been violating i would like to arrange an issue here and it's to the city attorney because my summation of this conversation is we are talking about prospective litigation right now and i would caution all of us not to make any other declarations or admission you're an attorney mr dunn thank you graduate from law school do you know how to spell this there's there is only one there's only one vetted lawyer in this room right now that's our city all right guys let's stop and share inside guys i think you need to caution us about if we're talking about perspective litigation is what's up here has the litigation been challenged has litigation been proposed you haven't noticed a lawsuit it's not perspective unless there's a notice of lawsuit that's what your code says that's what your charter says read it okay that's what the state law says so tell me what's the respect of litigation [Music] this is getting personal yeah well it was personally attacked me saying i'm not a lawyer [Music] come on and i propose another five minute timeout i mean yeah i think we need a timeout do we need to go no order could you guys argue on kids i think we should call for the question and move on with the agenda instead of continuing to have time out so people could yeah well i think we'll go i think we'll let the mayor run the meeting and we're going to talk to citizens next okay we need to take a moment everybody green there's only one person here that's losing his mind i know both we are called onion multiple times you guys are being reactive i've heard from gaddis and gunn and gaddis and gunn to defendants in the lawsuit all right am i allowed to say that i say we take a minute fred you gave your recommendations you gave your your thoughts which i solely appreciate and i'm ready to move on and vote so we can get this over with yeah i'm ready to bring it to a vote after i hear from the citizen comments and any other countries of course that's the proper protocol this council just gave the confidence notified to mr ryan i think mr raleigh has given us an ordinance that we should accept where does this are for today in the future i don't care about penny litigation all right this protects us today tomorrow if pending litigation you want to raise grandfather clauses or whatever do that for right now i think we should take close debate give it to the citizens yes i'd like to propose an amendment what's the amendment talk yes i would like to take the proposed change to the city ordinance i would like to leave in the section about the compliance of the florida statute 286 and strike the last sentence about prospective litigation no second it dies back to the other council comments on the original motion any i would like to make a propose an amendment a motion for an amendment all right so let me make sure i've got this straight uh third line where it says pending litigation i would like for it to say pending and prospective litigation except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.011 florida statutes everything else needs to come off and then that way that completely prevents us from discussing pending and prospective litigation yet makes the clause about the florida statute for the shape provision that was just proposed no he actually left off the he left off the pending perspective litigation that's why i didn't just cleaning out what you said all right we'll strike out the last sentence see perspective litigation is not mentioned whatsoever it just says pending litigation about that right so um i would like for its attending and perspective what's the motion do you want to eliminate the last sentence i'm trying to i'm trying we're not thinking out loud here dave you have a amendment or you don't if not i'm going to go to account to citizen comments you can make it later i just failed it out well what is it the last sentence or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any pending or prospective litigation ex that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.0118 florida statutes and of a sentence and you're striking the last sentence i said writing the last sentence okay i understand what you're doing we have a second to that second now we can discuss it it is first it makes perfect sense uh basically this uh clarifies the shade provision so that we legally have a way of doing it and as far as having any discussion of litigation in public meetings this would prevent us from doing that whether it's pending or perspective which i believe is the safe to go say foreign six point zero one one sub eight only deals with penelope right and that's because it's florida's statute it does not cover uh uh i guess that confuses me that that means not needed because perspective doesn't mean the shade i'm sorry i didn't understand that either well basically if you take the i don't have the original uh section d or 263 d in front of me i wish i did but basically it says pending or perspective we can't discuss it what's missing from it is the how we can discuss pending litigation according to florida's statutes so if you take this uh here it is right here currently it says the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the council of matters that are subject to any current or prospective litigation it actually should say pending or prospective litigation what's missing is uh following that a comma except that the council may discuss pending litigation litigation according uh in accordance with section 286.0118 florida statutes if you take what we have now and then you add that beginning from the comma about the exception i'm all for it that makes sense you covered all the issues right you look like you want to say something well dave your uh proposed amendment would of course strike the last sentence correct correct and it but see the way it's written right now it does not have perspective if you strike the last sentence completely it does not mention perspective whatsoever and i would prefer to leave perspective in there and then the exception is only allows for pending so you've got you can't discuss in on this diocese you you cannot discuss pending or prospective litigation in a shape meeting because of florida statute you can at least discuss pending in my opinion um this is this is my opinion the way i feel about it perspective is is a good way for us to debate it up here and and and i mean look there's things going on everything's being recorded anyone and trust me it will after um whenever certain people are no longer in office they're coming for us i can assure you and they're going to it's all going to be perspective until something is filed let me restate what i think your amendment is okay the presiding officer or on the request of the city attorney shall rule out of order any discussion by the city council of matters that are the subject of any prospective or pending litigation comma except that the council may discuss pending litigation in accordance with section 286.011 subsection 8 florida statutes period and the rest of the draft provision is stricken that's it that's exactly what i'm looking for do you need us to uh go ahead and maybe just table this so you can really look into it to make sure it doesn't break any other walls or no trucks can be driven through it i mean i'm just asking do you need more time to look it over with the change that uh vice mayor gaddis asked for um because i don't want to just jump on it are you making a motion and table is she's asking but she hasn't made it yet the and this is a godzilla stance i did not dwell and did not dig extensively into the constitutional argument that mayor manzo has asserted and the reason i didn't do that is because i thought this was the way i wrote it a fair way of presenting it if you would like to table this to another meeting that's fine i will look further into that aspect of it to make sure that there's there's absolutely no issue so i'm"
