    "transcript": "did you already call it to order i do okay j.c enfeld rudy davis angela berry you brenda bone sarah wandish weir here and laura mataloni approval on the agenda we can move right along like we did the last time you're the safer with your master upward and downtown the items that came in like authority and moore and those others can we just approve adding them to this meeting or do you want to do them at another meeting i've never heard anything you said the additional items that came in after this agenda was set which are the entry from susan moore and from dan doherty do you want to add those to discussion of this meeting or you want to put them in a later meeting we can mail them in as we go along they refer to exactly what we covered okay last time where is the list of the agenda this is second [Music] and that that was a minute yes and who moved and second the agenda the agenda i didn't hear that part okay so wanda and rudy for the agenda thank you okay discussion of the city is signed so we can start with as we did the last time uh rudy we can jump right on to your uh let's see you're gonna go first all right in discussion with ken yes okay with your discussion with a deputy which i think everybody got a copy of right yes [Applause] was there any comments you had or anything um i wanted to ask lynn about this situation with the rubber curb ramps and um whether he agreed that this was an issue and how about you laura what do you think of these curb ramps and eliminating those dan doherty's did you get a copy of dan dardy's yes just 12 hours during the week is that city instructed i'm sorry is the 12 hours a week that he spends code enforcement set by the city uh it fluctuates between 12 to 14 to 16. it can fluctuate anywhere from 12 to 14. okay so those hours are set by the city budgetarily speaking yes okay that seems to be sufficient sorry is it sufficient in your regard no it's not efficient is it insufficient in the number of hours to do the job or insufficient and how the job is done it's really not for me to say okay i think you should have the discussion okay all right well then let's let's skip over that and then go do you want to go one two one yes susan moore can i ask you a question laura did you say last time that you used to be the inspector did it take you more than 12 hours yes that's what i thought you were full-time right yes but in addition to code enforcement i was doing other two weeks so i wasn't devoting them to 40 hours totals but i was devoting much more time to 12 hours so i have a question when an infraction comes in and someone calls does it wait until dan is scheduled or can anybody can any deputy depending on the severity of the interaction if it can wait and be deferred to when he comes in if it's something that needs to be readily addressed then either lynn will go out or he'll send me out so depending on the item certainly we're not going to let something that's an issue wait till danny gets back but it was just a grass or something like that safety issue you would never do that right and danny's usually set on certain days it used to be monday wednesday friday and sometimes on the weekend but that deviates with the schedule so but an answer to the question when i was originally hiring the whole time that did not take full-time movies so i had other duties but it was definitely more than 12 to 14 hours a week i can speak to that real quickly but i was on council there was a survey done of the residents and the number one issue was code enforcement up until that point we had had only part-time code enforcement at first we had shared a code enforcement officer with indian rock speech for whatever reason he resigned so he hired somebody else who worked part-time and that was still insufficient so then the city hired florida to be a full-time basically a full-time vote enforcement primarily because that was the number one issue of the residence and it changed to officer doherty [Music] because we had a touchdown council this current council made that change pretty much after i left okay um outsource the world so lynn's here and sorry i'm like no problem i had the question we noted that officer dougherty is working 12 to 14 hours a week right and yet there still seems to be thoughts that code enforcement is not sufficient and my question to laura who she deferred to you was is that because there's a lack of hours or a lack of money no i think i mentioned this at the last week's meeting the the issue i have with it really is he doesn't he's a police officer that's that's the bottom line and i've spoken to his supervisors and laura and i both spoke with supervisors and they'll tell you the same thing he's a police officer first that's what he knows and he struggles with realizing that from they're you got to know a little bit about building permits you got to know a little bit about you know look at our codes and that's where he struggles because he'll he'll drive down the street this is probably a good example and you know i just talked to him about this and i was told well you know i didn't know if it was a trash can i said danny you know when the trash days are it's monday and thursday you know when it's recycling it's wednesday and this looks like a mixture it is i don't know because i haven't i don't even know what the advert is but it's i'm presuming it's all about a lot okay so my you know as i just said to him just a couple minutes ago he said well you know i get confused with this i said you know what the days are it's always something you know it's kind of like uh if you go to a house we've got two houses being built on 15th street okay right across the street from it there was a uh they're doing some significant work to this house okay well uh if you have complaints on 15th street in my mind if i saw it you might want to go up and check to see if this work is permanent you know just to ask someone didn't see it until i told him about it so that's stuff that's i have concerns about and i'm considering because it's really in my purpose i think that i can adjust his hours a little bit i'm going to put more back on the street a little more because we're missing stuff and part of it is because he doesn't he's a police officer that's a bottom line he's not a reporter well how long has he been doing this like over a year oh over here yeah so it isn't new but and we've had these conversations multiple times and you know i've told this bosses i mean i've had two two meetings with his bosses and another one just recently because we get in discussions about i had a complaint from a resident that he was talking to her healthcare worker about her co-violations he's supposed to do that you know so but there are some benefits to him you know he can run people down into his you know his computer and find stuff that it's hard for us to find but uh i think what we're going to try to do is focus in more on specific projects like we'll use journal registration an example in the condos you know we're going to focus in to start checking and then eventually you know i've talked to some of the council members about it and they probably don't care one way or the other and then other council members you know he's got to be there he's a police officer he's protecting us well maybe he is so that's what we're having but you're working on this situation and yeah the best you can you know yeah like i said i well i've talked to laura about her going out before city hall and then we'll give him more specific projects and eventually i would have to talk a little bit more about doing something else it was working fine the other way um pay attention to more of what's going on you have to usually be there to see he isn't doing any administration at all because the sheriff won't do that they told us that they won't do any of the administration so really laura's doing that any violations that are mailed out and co-hearings stuff like that how many hours is he contracted for in the contract with the sheriff's office well i could shrink his hours it's whatever i say to the chair so so that re that reduces the amount that they get paid that reduces the amount that they get paid isn't that part of an annual contract with them no this is a separate contract for code enforcement yeah he gets paid the same salary as a deputy for the city part-time but we pay the same hourly wage which is uh 47.88 that much no we pay 47.88 to the sheriff's office for that service per hour so it's costing us i think last year costs about 30 000 and we're going to part of that money that's left over the council is very interested in supplemental patrols where they put sting operations out there on certain holidays so that's what we're going to do well maybe i'm wrong but i thought i read in the code that there are sometimes that it has to be enforcement officer a law enforcement also because there's warrants involved code enforcement officer you're you're probably talking about uh love court okay that's what i call it well i think sheriff it's violation where you can give them a citation as an example who gave somebody a citation because they wouldn't move this derelict car and they have to go to court and fight it if they want to fight it but the fine is i don't know something like that she knows better than i knew about that stuff but those things it's much easier for a deputy to give because they're it's electronic for us to give them we have to type it up and mail it to them and then we have to go to the court to get a date and they go to the judge and for the most part it may rectify some things it doesn't rectify everything but i'd rather do that first than have to have a code enforcement if you can solve the problem you know if you can't get it with a courtesy notice and then a notice of violation then the what i call love court citation then you got to take but those are simpler steps than taking them to a year because there's a lot of things you have to do specifically all right the contract with the sheriff's office used to have wording that every deputy who patrolled the city was supposed to be on the lookout for code violations is that wording still in the contract do they still do it some of them pick up things like uh signs you know because our code says you can only have like a realtor can only have a sign on the s gov boulevard and one in the house for an open house so someone will do that or you know they'll put signs here on causeway when they advertise itself they'll pick stuff up like that or if they catch somebody working on something so that's about the limit of what they they do but then it says in the contract and then you know they they'll uh our problem is we were kind of i guess a little bit slow we had a deputies guy okay he was very diligent about doing stuff like that very proactive very much entwined with the residents and stuff like that well probably scott's the last one we've had for any great length of time since [Music] and you know they'll come for whatever reason they decide i don't like this place for various reasons you know things that happen they don't want to be hassled so they say they bid like right now all four of our deputies are brand new they don't have anybody that disappears unless the last they they have an opportunity to move every six months and we had what lydia was here for a year she she basically had issues she'd had enough it's time to go ernest is here yeah he moved on to try to get a little more money in night shift we had derrick for a year he kind of got mixed up a little bit in the all the halloween that's been going on over the last couple years and said you know i don't need this and he was a good deputy so you know that's part of the problem you lose good deputies because they don't want to get involved in the politics i guess a little bit can't you much about that well it just i mean i'm just going to say it i know that during covet there were a lot of calls made particularly to our neighborhood from elderly people where the sheriff showed up repeatedly including this deputy adultery i mean it was a daily event almost that they were being called out so i don't know i know you said he's been here a year but how much did the covid i mean that was just on my street i don't know what was happening well really and that's a discussion i've had with him you're not here for the police calls you're here for code enforcement but that is a struggle and that's because it's a police officer you know i guess if they hear on the radio [Music] there's a call and then they'll chime in and say i'll i'll be back well that's not what you're really here for so he only comes when he's working here right oh okay yeah yeah he thought he isn't coming for other than his days of work no he's not like if there's a call if there was a call monday danny wouldn't went to him because he wasn't here i got you but it's kind of a little that's part of what i consider a little bit of a problem he's trying to be the co-enforcement officer but he's intertwining and it's creating some issues well what's the ethics of that i mean i know yeah you see you you kind of have to respond don't you well well we're getting into an area i don't know if that's true or not true i have no idea but uh i mean if somebody's burglar alarms going off and you're yeah but he isn't higher he's hired for code enforcement he isn't hired to be the deputy he's hired to be code and there's a little bit of struggle with that separation i can see how that could happen we do have a full-time deputy they're supposed to be here right you know 24 hours really yes who is this well not not not a person okay 24-hour coverage from the sheriff's department and there should be a deputy assigned yeah like like the last daytime deputies that was lydia i met her several times too then ernest he was the daytime deputy deputy maltanato was the nighttime deputy and then we had a guy but he had to go out on family medically so you know those are deputies that are assigned to us like right now our deputy is on today's shift is joe and on the other shift days her name is ally it's a lady and then at night there's two other deputies first of all but they they're assigned to us out of the code enforcement situation rudy you want to continue on your situation what we were discussing dan's response to my questions and i think he may have gotten a copy of his letter that he sent back and in there he was referencing blocking of drainage through these rubber mats being placed in gutters and curves rubber curve range because the place to drive the engine into driveways and he says there's nothing specifically in the code that prohibits such a device and we should add something my question was to laura do you agree with that and she said you needed to address that yeah i i agree with them because that's blocking the drainage and we we've had a few of these throughout the city and there's a couple people that want to argue about it there are these rubber things that i guess they don't want their cargo driving yeah and the code for the drainage and i can't remember what section that's in what instead okay what it says is something to the effect that debris uh so it isn't clear so you know that's something that that's something that the house people think we need to add to say you know because it says like trash or something so we had the engineer look at it and he you know he put something out but then when the attorney looked at it he said that our code wasn't clear enough to enforce it because it just talks about degree and the person that has one i don't get it was on he made a comment well this is a debris so you can't enforce this mentality you know now other people they took them away but this one individual said no you can't afford this and then when i went to the internet he said well your code doesn't say specifically it's kind of like um which we'll get to later in like 94 but there are things in there that talks about elevations and things like that what you can have you can't have a habitable space on top of the roof and the definition for habitable is two different definitions so that's that's why you need to do something with this but this is a quick fix and what i'll do i'll come up with something just bring it to you okay so you're going to bring us the language we'll recommend that you go in yeah okay you got that patty all right i think anyone else having a comment on doherty's email okay we'll move on to trisha moore's response to my questions and i would note that she generally says the from her end of it she thinks it's an efficient process with the right teeth in it the only thing she had mentioned with regard to code was in point two that she says one suggestion that i have and i mentioned to laura and lynn last week is to send out courtesy notices for violation start right off with a violation notice with a reasonable time to correct so essentially she's wanting to eliminate courtesy notices and go right to a notice that you've got to make the correction and if you don't in other words going from three steps to two steps into porcelain what are your thoughts on that i'd much rather do the courtesy notice because i don't think we want to be the nazi please i think what we want to do is just try to get the clients and how this kind of came up was was with rental registration we had some code hearings and one of them we had to cancel and redo the notice to him because she didn't feel that we gave him a notice first and then a violation even though they were late we had sent them a letter what we do with that is we mail a notice in an invoice in august late late august early september and then it becomes late 31 october well in november then laura sends out the second notes well her interpretation our interpretation is we've already given them a second notice so why do we have to give them another notice before you can take the code so what we're going to do with the future with the second notice is sending a violation of that vote so that we don't come into that problem but i still believe you need to give people courtesy knows i mean if they fix it that's really the goal is to fix not just that's acceptable yeah yeah okay so on that where you're going to in that particular situation send them the first and then on the second you're going to actually we'll send them a second invoice that's late right and we'll send them a violation at that time okay are you yeah that's great because you know it you're going to do it but in the future that needs i think that needs to be in in something so that we know that it's policy and procedure rather than is just part of your administration when you move on it gets lost what can we do to prevent that getting lost then administrative policy i'll just update it and then it's not okay all right sounds good thank you um then she's got like he told us a housekeeping thing in point four that but i don't see a section 226 anywhere i don't need it when that came up i was looking and i didn't see it but what do we need to do it's probably just a housekeeping thing too yeah keep cleaning something out all right patty do you want to note that as a housekeeping 4.4 anyone else have any comments on susan's response and she's been around for a while huh almost seven yeah since play that's right was many of us yeah a little over 15 years okay rudy you want to comment on any of the other parts of this section um 10 10 yes before we go around the table we're going to finish the two letters moving to 10. most of them got here are actually questions for clarification to lend and starting off in section 10.1 regulation of builders and it defines the builder as any person who holds a certificate of competency then it goes on to say that such terms shall not include a private homeowner in district 1 or 2 who elects to undertake or manage such work clarify will two things i have a question about one is clarify what homeowners can or cannot do or manage well in the condos they can't do anything right has to be a contractor right in residential you can act as as the homeowner contractor all this is basically saying that they in essence don't have to have that license to do that work a resident doesn't have to have a license to do work that's normally required for a contractor to have the license right so including i think i'd get on to that in the next so so in essence how they look at it is they the pinellas county building department looks at it as a residence which is a single-family home you're the homeowner but in a condo you're one of many right homeowners so that's why they're saying they require a contract and actually this just happened to us but an owner of a condo was trying to renovate their condo themselves and doing the things that they think they got caught without a permanent okay and then they tried to get a permit themselves well it turns so in essence i can do electrical plumbing whatever i want to do you still have to get a permit technically uh the only things that are exceptions are painting and uh tile work and carpeting paper and all right i can't and i can't hang a new ceiling fan i can't do a new light fixture well the way our code reads technically you probably can't but i i don't think you're going to have to go i don't think the county is going to make you get a permit to hang in place i don't think we want to stretch yourself yeah i don't think we're going to but but just kind of fair warning i think i have heard that you do some electrical work and that work causes a five percent right and that's discovered in the investigation because of plywood your insurance company can then not pay for the damages because you didn't have a contractor certified that's another field it's mainly because you didn't get a permit right that that's what the issue is they can if you go like onto the property appraiser and they're getting better at it but you'll see a list your permits are going to be listed and so you know they kind of know and when they come to let's say you sold your house well they're gonna look at that permit list to see if there's any spaces like if you add it onto your house and you didn't get a permit for it well it's not going to show up so it's unpermitted issues and that's really because of the fema regulations that are out there with the flood insurance and things of that nature the requirement so people can't do substantial work to their house without a permit that's what the reasoning behind it okay um just to note this and 10.2 where it talks about uh construction work going on within the city shall be prohibited between the hours of 6pm and 7am i don't have any problem interpreting what that is on the clock it's essentially at night after six o'clock until in the morning at seven you can't have contractors you know working in those hours i was told by officer scott one time that that was nebulous and he wasn't going to enforce it he's gone no problem just pointing out enforcing that when we catch someone we are enforcing that no this was that one particular individual really yeah and then on another time same individual i had the guy and i called you where a contractor with a large vacuum for cleaning carpets pulled up on memorial day listed holiday and was cleaning for hours the carpets in a home that was unoccupied at the moment complaining he wouldn't enforce because he said that's nebulous i don't know why well i remember that i called him and said you'd remember that only you'd remember that i do remember that i'm kidding okay going on i got like right now did you have something wrong with this one the one thing wait a minute we're going to get to a individual if you want to comment on rudy's comment just on that one area where it says stuff about immediate family i do recall we had probably one time somebody was out there working on these days or after i was saying oh i'm a cousin you know i'm i'm part of the family i'm a cousin did we ever get a result on that one no because it's very hard to carry birth certificates how are you going to prove it or not but a cousin shouldn't be immediate family no it is it isn't but unfortunately that's very hard to enforce our best enforcement is if they bring a commercial truck and you say no you can't be here yeah like the carpet comes right you know they bring a commercial truck you need to leave uh and i know that's happened but it's very hard to control i know the public ethics laws that i set through like seven times they have very strict definitions on immediate family you know in-law in-law in law not cousins not grandparents well our our even our personnel policy has that you know it says uh what an immediate family how the hell are you going to enforce that kind of situation right because because there will be you could you know if they said they were cousin i guess you could probably tell them no that don't work but believe still respect yourself i respect your sister was she i worked for the juvenile court for too long and everybody was related it's hard to tell the difference okay um i had a part-time understanding in section 10-3 c interpretation and then it's sub-one compliance to me they seem like conflicting statements am i just reading that wrong or i mean one says any uh nothing in this section shall construe the conflict or supersede the authority of the state in regard to all these locations control lines waiver variants and then it goes down in the section one that says compliance for the propositions provisions of this chapter shall be independent of any action or authority of the state pursuant and no action by the state shall relieve any person from compliance one says you can't deviate the other one says mistake you can't you have to comply with the state statute but then the next one says no action in the state shall relieve any person from compliance with the requirement of the chapter lynn are you any trouble with this section at all has this come up before we're talking about 10 a and c 10-3 c interpretation and 1.1 below that sub 1 compliance and i thought there were conflicting statements one says the state has full authority does the state take no action to relieve any person from compliance with the requirements of the child you want to just get back to me on that i don't want to waste the time coastal construction line that's set by the state yeah but there is some i will say there's some i don't want to say mixture on that because pinellas county is a good example the coastal construction line is the building okay the county you can own property beyond that close to construction you just can't build them okay so there's some conflict with how the county is interpreting who owns what and i'll talk more about fellow shore if you look at the property line on shore as it goes north it comes closer and closer to the seaboard well the coastal construction line is mainly right at the seawall all the way down where the county is said that they own the property beyond the coastal construction line up to 17th street then it's pretty much the seawall none of the condos own any of the beach for the most part has this been a big situation with your city it's become a bigger situation because of this umbrella thing with bella shore who owns what what you can control who owns a beach who puts up with an umbrella yeah i understand so we can't solve that speaker so the state says one thing the county says something else i think there's a misinterpretation of what the coastal construction line is and what it's for it's mainly to tell you you can't build it has beyond to do with what it just says you can't go beyond that okay well it's just confusing to me but it's state law so yeah not an hour absolutely uh ten three permits and exceptions i go back to what i said before if you're doing a ceiling fan or a light fixture it seems to me here that they're telling you you've gotta have a contractor and prior to permit so just 10 32 v4 if it does it requires more than a common wall plug meeting ceiling fan wired in ceiling fan or a new light fixture just tells me that you've got to have a permit lunch um going on i'm not going to put any more time in that uh 10 35 sanitary facilities and i've seen this numerous times in front yards they come along and they set up a porta potty right in the front yard right next to the street all day long you got one it's it's an eyesore and two you got guys coming in and out of it and sometimes they got their clothes on sometimes they don't it seems to me that if they're going to put a portable sanitary facility in the front yard that they should have some kind of portable fence in front of it should be behind something so you can't see it some kind of portable pins they take down when they take the fortifies down but just my thought well that could be added it does say inconspicuous location but the reason so so could the wording be you know shielded or otherwise um close yeah but you got to look at the damn thing ugly yeah but it's a temporary thing it's not permanent so it depends to hide it should be it's also an attractive nuisance it's it's also an attractive nuisance maybe you can put just say inconspicuous effects so they would have to put a fence around it inconspicuous or shielded at inconspicuous or shielded location yeah it's either inconspicuous or it's got a defensive part of it yeah that's that's what i want yeah okay that that'll solve that it's like those black things in construction people put around the house on silk fence they're very ineffective all right and going on to 1036 d provide a dumpster of sufficient size with a cover never seen a cover on a dumpster that was that was changed in the last coat that they're required to recover okay so that's new and then um provide receptacles with lids and b provide receptacles with lids for disposal of food scraps bottles and cans and i see those blowing around the yard i don't think i've ever seen a receptacle like that they just throw it over in the dumpster and then the wind blows it out of the dumpster the bags and paper and what happened to me that's an enforcement issue that needs to be just i mean it's already written there it just needs to be of course also in 1038 um in the section two and three i'll say both of those where it talks about um no sediment discharged into the storm water system there are primarily two offenses there and that's concrete trucks who finish dumping their concrete and then the guy wants to wash out his dump shoe into the street which is not supposed to be what you're not supposed to do but you got to catch it well my my thought was in their way we can require a contractor to say if you are having concrete port on the site on a particular day you've got to let the city know so they can come by and inspect after making sure there was nothing dumped but you know what they when they wash it down it just goes down the sewer you'd have to pull a sewer cap and look down in there to see if you know it's to me it's a with our situation with stormwater drainage we would have to add something that you know we need to be as protective as we can about those situations one concrete washout and the other one is now that everybody's putting in paper driveways they come and bring the base material and they dump the base material they can't typically put it in the yard or whatever although you put a tarp down a lot of them want to dump it in the street real fast and then go you know put the base down from there to me it should be an ordinance that they have to leave it in a trailer if it's going to be left on the street has to be left in the trailer until it's actually we'll applied to look further because i think there is something that says you can't yeah they're there again it's enforcement right how are we going to improve enforcement well this is it's in five right exactly so what we need maybe is a little more policing in the construction site maybe something that says housework maybe you can put that one because it's here but they would have to notify us it's like a right-of-way permit when they start work they're supposed to notify us right what you were saying is that when they come to get a runaway permit or something that they're notified at that point that this is in the code and there's strict compliance yeah there's a type of permitting or something yeah if we put something in the you know just another line in the permit application right it says right you need to contact us like when they do a right-of-way permit there's a stipulation there that says you've got to call this the city number and notify us all right that you're starting work and then yeah okay can you make that notation it's in the code we're not getting good enforcement and that's a good resolution is putting it in the application permit noting that so the contractor is aware of it i need another explanation from lynn on section 10 4 building permits issued on the basis of an affidavit what is that about whose affidavit and what does it provide have to provide what are you saying 1040. building permits issues on the faces of an affidavit for building permits yeah what they do there's a in our application form there is an affidavit that they sign that states they understand xxx you know before we approve them okay but that doesn't extend your flood load and flood resistant construction requirements instead of scratching meet the requirements of the floor building whatever that is so yeah that's covered all right i just needed an explanation yeah all right the next one is way back in section [Music] 1081. you start in section three and four that you needed to add the word time shift operator of every motel hotel claims time share of other plans you launched adding the work timeshare there after hotel and in section four the same they use the same term hotel hotel or other transit just that time sharing there and then going on to 1083 we're going to talk about inspections and rate of entry in section e in case of emergency remedy imminent threat to health safety welfare effective party is believed to exist limitations put out in this section will not apply what happens if an emergency inspection is obvious and entry is denied you're talking about where 10 1083 section e the party is believed to exist limitations will not apply so it says you know essentially you don't have to let them know you're coming or something right well who has the authority to to make entry for an inspection our code enforcement person has a police officer okay so this says the city manager through the city attorney can prepare a quarter can you prepare a court order for entry no i'm talking about a case of emergency where imminent threat to health or something's going on that lauren just said largest indicated dakota force then you call the deputy right and the deputy high school yeah okay it would have to be a deputy yeah sure law enforcement yeah that's kind of like uh maybe a situation like their building's on fire the fire department well not not necessarily that issue we have we have people in the city that we've had to go there because they're not taking care of themselves and the neighbors called and we've sent the sheriff and they have a unit that actually does that with them and sometimes they make our acting for two or three days and take them to a hospital they have to be released back and you know other instances where they have a they need to get someone to manage their affairs you know we have an individual in the city that they've got a person that manages their affairs because they can't take care of their property themselves or themselves really so they're the person that may do something like make sure their swimming pool is chlorinated then turn green make sure their yard is cut things happen but they do have the right to enter the promises okay that's all i have for tim thank you now we can prove miss barry she submitted so 10-32 i mean since we're doing this and it said wallpaper i wondered should we add on b number one drywall repair or do we need to get that specific i mean if you hit droppings from that man there is a in the building code if it's over 100 square feet of drywall you have to get it from it okay i wouldn't even know how much i had a square feet of trifle what is well something we haven't read yet gotten to yet well that's in the florida building oh that says it's funny you bring that up because that just happened with the condo okay and they admitted oh we're gonna put drywall over our ceiling to hide the popcorn put new drywall up well it was 100 square foot is basically three sheets of drywall it teaches you to scrape up well these people this was the people that want to get them it's an issue and they were gutting the place you know they said oh well it's just painting and don't know it isn't you put in i mean we had a picture of it it was the whole so i think if you put something like that in there you would be opening the possibility yeah unless you specified less than 100 feet or yeah i mean orphan system with florida building closer yeah you could put something like that in there but i i really think has it gotten out of hand no okay so i don't think we've had any i just wondered you know since you have wallpaper in there should we put drywall repair a lot of times when you scrape off wallpaper you're fixing your drywall no no no and i understand that but i guess you could say put in drywall repair less than 100 square feet yeah just to clarify so people aren't scared to death well they aren't scared y'all are scaring me let me tell you right now it's like no okay so the next one was number four i just again the question is should we add it says electrical connection a lot of appliances require gas connections so should we add we probably should just say unless electrical or gas connection yeah no simplified while you're doing it right i mean while you're updating it and then on 10 38 uh a where it talks about a fee it says that the city council can change that fee and since we're talking about increasing fees should that be done now this is mainly uh silk bed speed when we have problems with people that if we have to go back to them we don't assess it when it's like the second time the third time it's when it's the fourth or fifth time we tell them there's a hundred dollar fee to inspect us because they keep doing it and for the most part it's only one person that we've ever had to collect them from because we have to keep trying if you have to keep going do you have a red tackle okay so 10 dash 74 a7 it was just you know i was looking that they already have language in here about docs and sea walls peers and mourns should be maintaining a good state of repair another section right well what you're saying we should add a good state of repair pursuant to whatever whatever we come up with that's that covers it right there and then 10-77 so when you're talking about this is where i didn't i wondered if we should include the concern about the palm trees that were mentioned if there was an issue with some sort of palm and i thought you said washitonian so is this a good place and i wasn't sure what the issue was with the washington pond well they're not committed technically because well it's in the code that way that's that account right yeah i was at that council meeting yeah the man who was commissioner and we did change we probably in this section we probably need to add an invasive species just as an ad and the reason i say that in the last couple of years we call brazilian pepper because technically it's called a grass it's not a tree and so that falls in the seven inch height requirement of grass so and we've told a few people that they've had to cover down issues being like mainly on vacant lots and when we went since we changed that code was two years ago two years ago we've been able to get these vacant lots to remove that effort you know because they don't want to cut it to seven inches they won't just get rid of it because you you're cutting a stump to seven inches and guess what tomorrow it's gonna be eight inches or nine inches because the thing pops back down so fortunately we've had good luck with with that so that that probably needs to be added in here area free of dead dying trees invasive species etc sure should there also maybe be a reference to chapter 22 for environment because all of this is covered in chapter 22. right but i think it's good to add as an additional invasive species recommended okay okay notice the violations oh um so i guess my question on 10-88 notice of violations method of service number one was hand delivery by sheriff or other law enforcement officers is the sheriff providing that notice or didn't you say we don't have a sheriff anymore okay but the sheriff is who we have law enforcement or code code inspector or anyone can that that's basically what i was talking about courtesy knows like right now danny will go out with the courtesy nose to johnny because maybe the first time he's got a car parked on the grass instead of giving him a citation you tell him don't worry so they're just not biller beach police department anymore okay in the in the number two about leaving the notice with somebody who's over 15 years of age and i mean how would you know that are they going to ask yeah this is from state of the flower yeah we have a neighbor who has a son with asperger's and he would he's older than 15 but if you handed that to him they'd never see it that's why they leave it sort of to the discretion of the individual yeah just like is that 15 year old might not be right okay section 10-92 administration [Music] um i just had a question about reasonable cost of repairs how often does that happen and are these monies that was included in that discretionary fund that you asked to increase like if there's an emergency and you have to fix something that would fall under an abatement absolutely you know we've noticed a violation and we probably use the payments more for things like grass over her own stuff because i can sit in the public works staff to cut grass well what that costs them is their time their hourly wage the cost of utilizing the equipment we have a fee schedule set up for that then on top of that there's an administrative fee about 150 so it may cost 75 in labor we'll say but the 150 administration fee is put on top of it so if somebody doesn't cut their grass it's going to cost them 225 if the city has to do it or has to hire someone it's the same situation here if we needed to do repairs to make sure it was public health safety and welfare then whatever that cost to that repair we would charge that then we'll be charging one straight to b so if it was like a sea wall we we would we wouldn't do that that would be in contract that's what what what i'm more concerned about with the sea walls is we need to make the homeowner get someone to look at it or something yeah that was my next question is if it is a big job do you get vids on that we don't have the staff okay thank you very much right now we'll go to brenda actually the two questions that i have been addressed they've been addressed thank you very much next case wanda okay nice okay you have my list we started back at 10 22 i had the should we define immediate family and i think we said that that's really up in the air well i mean we can put it as a definition of you know the heading and under definition you'll never be able to because a law changes every day but you'll the problem is okay if the definition is brother son book of love related [Music] yes it is and we don't really i don't think we've ever really had much of a problem with that well there was the one on harrison the the family was the guy was trying to do a lot of the work himself and they were working at all hours of the day every day every holiday every weekend and when you went to talk to him i'm a cousin i'm a cousin-in-law i'm part of the family i'm okay i'm her brother yeah well i mean i don't think it's bad all you have to do is take a list take a look at the list in probate court of who has a right to file for on a will well but but what i'm saying is i'm not saying we should incorporate it upsetting it's really involved well you can create a definition of immediate family which we already have that definition in other things in the city so if we use that then so you have precedence for the definition right and the second point was whether or not how many complaints do you get on this on this topic of the work being done outside of hours or on holidays do you really have to wait for somebody to complain or is there proactive well we do bring the code enforcer in occasionally it's not every weekend i i will say some weekends he catches someone some weekends he does maine because it's mainly sunday or uh you know the deputies are aware that if it's after six o'clock they should stop and tell them because the government guy isn't here at that time uh probably the majority is if we get a complaint then we'll monitor it and see if you know it's factual because you know i'll say something to the deputy or i'll have the code enforcement guide check it on the weekend i've called the non-emergency number to complain a few times in my residency here and they they they have a deputy check on it yeah yeah so so they're willing to you know that's they're very willing it's hard to sometimes you don't really know what's going on i mean people do a lot of things that are have surprised me over the years you know they'll have a contractor come work at their house and tell them to drive your private truck so it's it's not you don't know what obviously yeah okay okay and then on 10 22 i just after including roof painting comma and wallpapering because you're not going to be wallpapering your roof it's not so common that's all right no big deal 10 34 incomplete construction have we ever had to raise anything not that i've been aware of uh you've threatened a country we we did you remember that you probably even remember that house over here by my house this is perez and she i remember that house and you know the contrary to all kinds of angles to get because it was there was nothing inside after more he moved out sold it she basically finally i don't know what i said to her i said plumbing and electrical in operation in the house if it was going to stay there and she didn't like that idea so she tore down good so she did it for you okay i think that was when we were we did and the reason we did that is because of the house like that you know we don't have a lot of those in the neighborhood you know we have a house right now that is past its permanent time and we had a co-hearing with them last friday on 25th and my business there's a house it's a big concrete monster uh awesome huh it's all smith yeah yeah so the magistrate told him she gave him a seven month extension to finish the house if he doesn't finish it it's 108 100 a day fine from last friday and he has 30 days to provide us with a list of a plan finished by august 31st so he's got about three more weeks to send that to us or something at some point if he doesn't do that then he's in violation for a quarter so we'll see what happens with that house it's been very slow i mean he asked for an extension and from the extension period the only thing that got done to that house was they put some windows in it and they stuck with it that's all they did six months so i'm not too optimistic that it's it's going to end up like that house rudy remember that house on harbor harbor that we had just buy them to death and finally they realized that it was going to cost a lot of money and they ended up paying like a third of their money part of that issue with the contractor and so not complying with what what the owners are even wondering right yeah very belligerent so you know those are things that you know you hate to do it to somebody but i mean we had to do it to a house on harrison the same thing you got x amount of days to finish it you don't finish it you're going to be paying this big fun okay okay 1071 general provisions on b1 it says to something diminished property values detract excessively from the appropriate appearance of the area is i think that's a little subjective maybe just refer to 1072 for clarification or maybe even chapter 22 for environment i mean there's a lot of there's a lot of we have a lot of codes that cover things but 1071 is kind of vague we just want to make reference to 1072 at the end of that section yeah in either that or 1072 or chapter 22 whichever one might or may be both of them because they both cover they both cover appearance and environment chapters 22 and 1072. okay yes thank you and then on 1072 we have the thing called lighting influence has anything ever been excited for being of lighting influence we've given courtesy notices a few times like as an example for painting things like that and in most cases they've taken care of a couple cases they have but there's a few houses in the city that we probably need to go back through and send them a first schema courtesy notice if we've done it before then we give them a moderation uh that uh it's an elderly lady and instead of cutting the leaves they spread so it's been no big problem it can be it's taken care of okay and there's a couple of instances like in the 1074 general standards talking about gutters and downspouts to be kept clear of debris and it didn't working and someplace i was talking about under basements or something crawl spaceship had glassware are these the statements of principle or is there any way it's enforced because you can't really see it usually okay it's just unless with gutters you happen to go by when it's raining and stuff's pouring out of it all right which chances are much raining that hard you wouldn't be able to tell anyway and then 10 74 7 on the dot seawall paraguay perhaps this the thing is that handbook is really good and very comprehensive i have a question that went in on further on down can we make that handbook part of the official policy or when we get to chapter 30 just incorporate the whole thing into chapter 30. i think this needs to reference however we end up incorporating the handbook say just in good repair this state of repair i think needs to be clarified in reference to where the details are wherever we put them i think we could reference the handbook as another document outside of the code instead of trying to put the whole hand and addendum to the code or something yeah that'll make that'll make our review of 30 a little easier and then when you get down to 12 is the one that i complained about the garbage shall be placed in the garbage disposal facilities or stored with leads right it shouldn't have to require a neighbor to complain then you get to 1075 basic equipment and facilities permanently fixed address numbers on the front of the buildings but shall be clearly visible from the street that's an issue of enforcement yes you know did you put that in that last structure yes our department comes by at times and they've said put it on there yeah but there's i can pick i'm just saying i'll have to make that an address why sure you know they don't want to mess up the front of their house i mean we can do so note that it's not conspicuous in our well there's a lot of houses without a number of them i mean i know that i guess well you know it does say that it's got to be here and you know the fire district i'm sure wants those numbers absolutely so does the life squad police department that's a very important note yeah to somehow come out of this community and on 1076 lighting ventilation again is this just a statement of principle or is it enforceable like like the gutters you're really it's hard it's hard to it's hard to find and since 777 just maintenance and appearance standards again a lot of that famous and apparent standards is covered under chapter 22. right this is kind of what we were talking about earlier about life some of this stuff we if we find something we can actually use this section of code to reinforce what we're asking as an example a good example would be screens okay okay then we get to 1088 notice of violations under c method of service maybe we go back to what we said last time and add wording and hear about the photographic proof of delivery yeah we pray just i mean we've done it automatically when we post it because i want that record to be able to show the magistrate to say it was posted yeah but if you're giving a notice to a young person that you're not sure their age having a photograph of who you gave it to the fact that it was actually served like a process server i don't [Music] 90 of condemnation um all costs occurred by the city for serving or demolishing a business or structure shall be assessed against the property has that has that ever been never had one again a 1092 city managers authorized to make more reasonable repairs again i think we talked about that under angela's point division two swimming pools this whole section underwent extensive modification within the last five years are there any issues in here that we this committee needs to be concerned about i don't think so if we went through it two years ago for several months for several months and you know there's some discussion about the requirement that the deck of the pool can only be 18 inches above the crown of the road well my understanding why that was put in place is because we had some issues with people filling lots and there's a good example on gulf boulevard where that one house is built up like this and then they just got their houses with their pool at the same level well i think that's when the codes changed because of things like that and recently we just had another one come in with that concept they came in and wanted to build the house and build a lot so you could walk out of the first floor onto grass they wanted to have their yard up at that level and then i had another house on thursday the same thing so yeah well let's say the is an example probably down on howard those are probably six or seven foot elevation already so the bfes maybe 10 or 11 so they wanted to build a lot by foot now what all that's going to do is we're not going to stop all that drainage you know you're just dumping it on your neighbor and that's what's happened with those houses even though they built a wall around in the back they built a short wall stem wall around it it still has drainage problems yeah so uh i don't think we need to change any of that a lot of people you know and today at times you know i know there's been pools built there may be one up here and the next goal is down here well a new house is built and that moves down here so i think the 18 inches above the crown of the road restricts it's part of the code sure that you know we evaluate the psych plans so it is tied in with that for many but you know there's always someone that comes and says well i want to build my swimming pool well we've got a standard that was set at some point in time well then he'd have to get a variance and a change and all that sort of stuff well that's the only option to get a variance sure you know you've got to that'd be like saying uh next door rwanda they tore the house down and decided well i'm going to build a mound here and then i'm going to build my house on it now do you think the neighbor's going to say that's okay with them when you go to the variants or the neighbors have some input and that's you know and who created the hardship you created not somebody else so i i don't think that's something that don't belong here no it's it's i think we've already went through one question i do have about 18 inches when we're doing road repair are we raising the crown of the road at all typically all we're doing is building a quick fact like right now with the mill uh where we just killed bellevue estates island all those roads in there yeah we're just gonna pull back 30 and 54. so so that that's a non-issue okay that was all i had so we got that one we covered 54 we've got 30 and 94. stupid marine thing jc did you have anything some of the things that are covered some of the suggestions were excellent and or do do so uh noted by patty and taken in by laura and lynn man we'll put in the one big bunch here at the end paddy will and i'm very proud of the everybody getting involved like they did we've had 100 attendance this is something that's fantastic as far as i'm concerned with any meeting during these time periods i do not have anything to add except that i did read as i did as i told you before i talk business law at one time but a lot of it is out of our control and controlled by the state code by the florida code by executive order whatever so we're doing the best we can with what we got so far so good we have three sections left to cover this is how they're unfinished 30 and 94 and put in through this sea wall manual lettuce yeah that's basically would be me that's part of 30. can't hear you that would be part of third i know i'm holding this in my hand asking laura and lynn to supply this forward with just some specific specifics that you picked up that might have come out of council that they're concerned about because there's so much stuff here well i i think if you read i did that and then kind of go through we went through 30 a couple years ago really all we're trying to do is get some that's what we're looking for stronger language about if the damn thing's going to fall down you need to get an engineer to look at it and kind of think that that's really all because we did go through 30. and i think another thing might be i don't think it's covered so much of the seawall but in the madeira beach of things i think they get into a little more detail on docks and dock maintenance and i think that's been an issue that we've had in this city that particularly after a storm people tend to ignore the fact that their talks are destroyed or in the process of falling down and i think that needs to be looked at a little more closely yeah it's it's mainly the the docks in the sea walls that we need to focus on that's not so much it's mainly how do we come up with a way to enforce in some way shape someone to be able to tell them hey your sea wall has got a problem you need to get an engineer and there are some the things that the sections i gave you here there's some things in there is there anything in this group under unfinished business that should come up i do have a question okay when do we have to start looking at the comprehensive plan is that going to be i can't hear you comprehensive plan that's what do you ask that i just [Music] i just signed the contract with the county yesterday uh or with ford canals and sent it back to him so uh we'll get probably some kind of time schedule from the planner that's gonna do it here but she just sent me the document today's wednesday yeah she sent it to me in the evening i sent it back to her we mailed the originals this morning so did the purchase owner they're gonna charge us five thousand dollars that service up to not to exceed so anything else under unfinished business i can ask for citizens comments and there was a citizen that commented last time and it wasn't noted i just wonder if there isn't nothing okay now i have a question for lynn on this meeting excuse me is that a virtual meeting coming up that you what is it live meeting right we don't have any virtual choice okay so somebody from our group should be here to see and all you need to do is just give them a synopsis of what you've done you went through sections 210 and 54 and you'll be making recommendations that's basically all you do okay it'll either be myself or one of the ones okay so that's on the sixth that's the first patty is that the sixth first first february one the first next monday at 6 pm yeah your reports are right after the police presentation so it's right at the beginning at the beginning yeah the last time i was here to report they waited till the end the meeting it's it's at the beginning of the meeting there's the citizens comments the sheriff and then the board reports yes okay appreciate that very shortly i have to appreciate the involvement of the city helping us along with some of this interpretation if there's nothing further to do i will call for adjournment for those who papered closed so moved"
