    "transcript": "okay good afternoon everyone i'd like to call to order the september 6th regular park and rec board meeting nicole could you please call the roll sure caroline cornell everybody cornelia yeah here tammy lavender here george ortel patty roberts nicole sussman here um an alternate deb decosmo not here and then um city manager interim kyle reaper here okay all right great thank you [Music] um the second item on the agenda is the approval of the minutes from august 18 2022 park and right board meeting can i have a motion to approve the meet notes meeting notes [Music] i second all in favor hi hi um item agenda item number three citizen comments we don't have any citizens today so we'll skip right on to number four which is um kyle if you can give us a quick recap of the wait have we missed something we did of the agenda and then the approval of the minutes but she hasn't oh yes so i'll just need an approval i guess i didn't approve today's agenda sorry yeah no no that's my bad um a motion to approve today's agenda i'll make the motion to approve the agenda can i have a second all in favor oh sorry about that i was getting ahead of myself i don't have to see you moving around like that okay go ahead i need to put my glasses back now you can go kyle sorry here's an update on our action list so this is from like usually at least once or twice a year the parking record splits apart all the 13 parks and we do surveys good bad ugly pictures and that meeting usually takes longer because some people have more detail or whatever there's more things going on in the parks that they surveyed so kyle then put together this action list and i know i think you guys have seen it once before so yeah so some of the things we still have to do we made a couple attempts to paint the water fountain but it has been on days where the rain is rolling right up so we haven't quite got there yet but that's right around the corner um some things that we gotta plan probably when it cools down just a little bit is all the shell in the landscaping um that's mostly what you're seeing in the orange there um and then some other just like to see grave and um some adjustments to the landscape beds so kind of want to do that all once we'll order like a big load of shell and then kind of disperse it around the city um when do you think that'll be like november do you have a time frame in mind i want to say like maybe october um getting just depending on how it all goes you know the grass starts slowing down a little bit and then getting close to the end of the hurricane season i think that's a good time period to tackle that um we do have the back rack we didn't move it where you know that that's something we were planning on kind of repainting or something to make it look better and um we're gonna demolish the existing playground that's gonna be in january before because we're on back order for the actual new one so we didn't really want to get rid of it until we are like right around the corner putting a new one in but that's something at that time we'll address that walk over um possibly getting rid of that just because it's deteriorating i don't think it's worth putting back because it'll be quite expensive um and it doesn't really serve a purpose can i ask a question sure so i know when we first started on this like i guess with nicole and i and george um it was a big deal about that easement through and then we kind of like dropped off with the city council and no one really brought up that easement again yes well i mean and they were looking at two or three different things and i keep seeing the paving paving paving and then i heard it's coming up again and it's in council meetings and it never really made our radar because when it dropped off you know what i mean so i didn't know like are we just completely out of that or like no because we're still we still have money in our capital projects for it um once we get underway so the money's been budgeted for years yeah okay um i'm gonna say like at least a couple years now how much is it i don't have a budget in front of me is it like a fifty thousand a hundred thousand oh but for all of it yeah it's probably 200 or more in asphalt but if we i mean depending because the prices went up um that we got a quote for it all together but we were going to break it off with each road project or stormwater project as we're in that area to kind of save on the cost drop some of the mobilization off but in that time the pricing in general because inflation has gone up so i think it's probably if you chunk it out it's still going to be close to 200 000 at this point because again our prices have gone up so much now was that voted on like for it to pass well it was voted on to save for in the budget it was never voted on so the first segment would be between 13th and 14th while we're there um so that's kind of like we're trying to get this project underway just getting through some conflicts with utilities what i would do is get a proposal at that point from uh kaminga which is the contractor just to see what they'll do it for while while they're out there with their paving company and then i would have to bring it to council for approval i'm sure there's going to be i don't know in that area so much but it may be just in general i know that there's people that do not want that yeah i mean there are definitely people that do it's going to be like the buoys and i didn't know like this is the way i think about it if like if city council has five people out of seven that want to run on that trail then it's gonna pass and if no one is you know what i mean like because i know there's residents that are like dead set against it um and i've just kind of been randomly asking people like are you a runner versus a biker or whatever and they'd be like well i i'm a runner but i'd never run on it because i'd be afraid i'd get hit by a bike because if that's open because people don't want to ride their bikes on the bike trail on gulf boulevard because you see too many people on their phones and you're at least i'm afraid i'm getting hit by a car but at least if you're running you can run on the sidewalk but the bikes aren't supposed to be on the sidewalk and so they're like i'd be afraid to run on it because of the bikers that don't want to be on gulf boulevard or not you know you just hear all these like different everybody has their opinion um so i just didn't know if like you were going like like ask the park and record or because it was kind of before us and i just didn't with it being 200 000 and we still have streets that are flooding like and there's so many projects that are like we don't have the money we don't have the money we don't have the money but then you have 200 000 for something that you know how many residents are actually going to use that i don't know it could be everyone or it could be no one i don't have a clue okay so there's a lot there's a clarifying that for the rest of us it is a walking easement that the cities had and i think originally it was for uh to provide an alternate means of access it's 10 feet wide people use it all the time where is it it's um so it's like it starts in the south of the city and uh so you have um first street and then you have harbor drive so it kind of runs like in parallel with harbor drive or a continuation between each uh you know first second street and you know you got hardwood drive that section there and then you've got to go all the way back out to gulf boulevard or there's a walking easement it's 10 feet wide that's probably i don't know 100 something feet that gets you to third street and then you wonder how many residents don't even know about it well there's an easement there too right north of it all um so it goes all the way so on this side it goes from um second street it's between second and third between fourth and fifth between sixth and seventh and then eighth and ninth and then it takes you down here um where you would have to come walk in by the building up here um and that's where it gets interesting too because there's no real safe way to cross causeway but you know it's a lot of people turn and go out and run yeah most people don't go all the way that way you know they turn and go out of here so um and then it continues we've talked with the county of possibly putting um the path officially on their pond over here getting an easement with the county because the the pond is the county's land and then the property line for that house is kind of like you can see where they differentiate so then you would either have something or not depending on what the county says to take you to 12th street and then it goes 13th the 14th 14th 15th because on this side it's just signal streets so it goes from each cul-de-sac all the way up to 18th and it never connects to 19th because um just i i don't know they tried to resurvey it and the property just never permitted it to go all the way it would be nice to go and i'll eat my teeth but it didn't because we hadn't re-surveyed so it's pretty broken up no matter what um it kind of is i mean it's it's convenient for people who live on the end of the streets that want to get down to cosby boulevard and i think initially the easement was intended for utilities and emergency services but like some of them like the 10 foot wide path is as close to someone's bedroom window as me to you so like obviously they bought the houses knowing they had an easement in the backyard but when they bought them it wasn't paved either right it's not for people some people have walls only and some people have you know their six foot ball fence if they want to do a living hedge they could go to eight feet yeah but well by second street by me they have nothing so like you're literally staring into their whatever window i don't walk it um i mean i may have been on it five times but i just so you wonder how many residents don't know about it even even though it's been talked about in council meetings for years you know if you're just if it doesn't peak your ear if you have no clue where it is or what it is you know it's um that was it right if you didn't live near there you might never know it's there yeah a lot of people do use it though from indian rocks all the way you know you see people right walking and that's the problem that's why they're like i guess they used to have it it was more active years ago and i don't know the reason why it was more active but i was told it caused nothing but problems because like people don't have eyes on back there it's dark oh um well it's not supposed to be open at nighttime but you can't close it i mean there's no it's not like a gate or a fence it's open 24 7. right so it's behind your house it's not behind my house it's behind it's like if you uh if you go off a golf and you turn on second right before you see 2nd street park it's literally right next to that person's driveway and so it cuts between everybody's houses and then some people built their fence over it so there's encroachments if you know what that is over the walkway because it's never been paved it's never been shelled it's never been like a formal so when you if you do use it it's muddy it's gross it's got roots that you can trip on you know so it's not a i don't think it's a pleasant walk which is why i don't if if it was paved you know maybe the people that do walk it would think it was more pleasant but it's 200 000 so you're like how many residents would use it and know about it to make it worth that spend versus whatever else you have in your budget can i ask a question on that so just was there so if they approved it for the budget say for 2022 and you don't spend it in 2022 do you have to go through a re-approval process for the following year to re-prioritize other items or what's that so it's like in the capital savings plan so the money say that year of the approved budget got set aside um for the next year's proposed budget either you add more to that savings plan or you know but it's it still has some budgeted so it accumulates depending on how many years that budget goes and moves money into that pot but at any point it can be reallocated okay yeah so to her to tammy's point if they were to decide hey look yeah it's not so all it is is on a savings program that's setting it aside so it's it's it's assigned it's not an unassigned fund where it's just money we have right it's assigned in the capital you don't use it what is it carries over right and you don't actually spend any of that money until you actually do the project and it's just there like i'm trying in my mind to be empathetic because it doesn't affect me you know what i mean it's not like i don't have my house isn't right there it's like you've got to walk like six houses down before you even get to the beginning of it so i try to be empathetic for the people that want it and the people that absolutely don't want it i think it's going to be like the buoys yeah i think so too i've always kind of seen this like two years out you know back i was like oh this is going to be yeah well it's only been approved like to save for it it's not been approved to do to execute it yeah all right [Music] those are the people that use their own partner and i think they got on to the department wreck committee just to push that to influence it yeah okay but that was three one two three at least three administrations ago what is the key like what do the colors mean oh that's kind of more internal um so so like say the blue ones are done yeah just yeah finish counting towards that 72 completion the green is like it's happening just it's in the budget like it's going to happen um the pink is kind of like it's going to happen in the future but this is kind of like my color coding it's going to happen in the future but that's kind of like planning on a timetable um and then the orange is like the yellow is going to be most immediate and the orange is um definitely going to happen just like once we get past it yeah i know that's kind of makes more sense in my head no that's good um thank you does anybody have any other questions on this chart or um like with the um the easement walkway that we were just talking about would that end up on this or not really because it's just separate no okay this is just from our server so that first piece is gonna be like hey here's the price to do this part of that easement we have money in the budget do we want to do it and that's when it's gonna we're gonna find out what people really want okay perfect so do we is it important for us to voice an opinion on that what do we think about the what are not um i mean it doesn't seem like we're very enthusiastic that this group here is about the sure that's that's up to you guys if if you feel stronger one way or the other you can say hey as a park and recreation advisory board we don't think from based on what we know and people we talk to you know it seems very expensive for the sheriff it's getting now or potentially using my kids so i i don't feel like it's a valuable use of our money personally very expensive for the number of people that's why i ask the question about the budget whether it rolls over because it almost feels like those big capital expenditures that make sense that you scratch it you know if you don't if it's not urgent enough that you do it within that fiscal year then you scratch it you go through the approval process again but i'm sure that something city council has a rules on they have a budget committee i guess does that have a veteran coming here yeah well the assistance advisory name advisor yeah they are committee they they function as the budget okay well you can always let them i can say something that guy says near me at every city council yeah i think if it's not urgent enough that it carries over into the next year then maybe we should re-look at it and re-prioritize like something else becomes more important than that in you know that year yeah flooding right yeah and it to this point it's only been talked about okay we'll like we'll get a price on it doing it with the stormwater project so this would be the first time it actually would be addressed to all right they're gonna move forward with it or not so depending on um i bring a proposal to them for a lot of them it's got to line up with the strategic plan it's got to make sense and i don't know if this is where they want to go so they might just say hey and i make a decision okay perfect does anybody have any other comments on this no okay perfect so um agenda item number five september third beach cleanup so we had three park and rec board members there this saturday thank you guys for coming um we had 15 people total which was really good for a holiday weekend because you never know you know um what you're gonna get and so yeah i mean it was um it wasn't bad this time but you know you never know what you're gonna get with that either so it was just kind of status quo i would say didn't sell any bellar beach merchandise because the people that were interested and did were like oh i didn't bring a wallet which is totally fine at least they know that they can come now to city hall and buy it so it's more like visual what colors what do they look like without coming up here um you know and kind of going through it all with laura so that saves her some time they can just go hey i want the great t-shirt in a large or whatever but we did get to talk to a group the whole group about the chili cook-off and so kyle had printed out some of the instruction sheets and the sign up sheets and there was some really good interest so um just a way to like you know get the conversations rolling maybe talk to your neighbors you know we're just gonna keep getting it out there and see what we get and then um i took some tickets and i just we put it on the little sign with the pricing saying you know they're ever you know every ticket's 10 bucks and you get this x or whatever so well um you have all those upgrades or did you get rid of them all the sign up sheets oh i thought you were going to print them out let me just curl once like okay well they all saw it patty emailed it to all of them so they've all had eyes on the most creative or three categories i saw that that's right we didn't okay yeah so they've all had to have you needed to bring like you needed to bring the crockpot and your legal and all that are we gonna post and that i finally got on that bellar site um the beller beach facebook site we're gonna start posting on that how long do you normally do that in advance at the event like a month prior well okay so a month prior it opens up to everyone so we're gonna probably do it about two months prior um and then and kyle and i were kind of working on the layout of the room which even in the 15 minutes or 10 minutes that we looked at it we changed it nine times so it's all going to vary and you weren't there george george is our table mover so we're trying to like you know so like these tables we're we're trying to figure out it will all depend on how many chili entries we get like whether or not we put like the community foundation table at the bar and you know we're thinking about the lines because we don't want the lines for the bar if there's a line for the bar there may not be a line but in most places that's where the line forms especially in the beginning so you know it's like here are the tables for people to sit and eat their chilies and then you know around will be the chili's and then we'll have tables outside if the weather's permitting um so this is gonna change 100 times but just here's an idea if you you know for kylie how many would that allow how many different kinds of chilies per per table well we'd have about two crock pots per table and i love about 20 contestants and purposes so yeah if we get between 20 and 30 people you and i saw like this is not like it would be a weird thing to ask people to bring it was for a home chili cook-off but okay so you think there's 20 30 chilies who is going to eat you know i mean you could like i don't know like you start at table one and it's like who's going to get to table 30. it's so much chili but they had you know like in the pans that you make cupcakes in so like people literally had them like school lunch trays and they went around and like it was one two three four five six and so they got 12 samples of chili on the same tray and then went back and sat at their thing and i was like oh my god that would be so cool but how can we like i mean we can't ask people to bring their cupcake tin you know what i mean yeah i so i was trying to think it's like oh so kyle did find some hot cold cups in the same size so like that'll take care if there's a temperature issue but it's like it's literally you can hold two of those at a time go back to your table go get two more go back to your table so we're just gonna hope for the best and hopefully like the first ten tables aren't out of chile in the first hour and then the other side of the room is still like overflowing because no one got to them but i did it my last one you might people walk around and see which ones they want to choose yeah because i have certain things i won't eat you know yeah eat at lamb chili or something you know we all have our preferences or you don't want them super hot or you're gluten free or whatever right so you just kind of move you go around and you see what's there and then but i love the idea of the muffin tent we can like post that on facebook or i can post it on the facebook page and just show a picture like feel free to bring your muffin to it it'll make it a lot easier to carry around all your samples yeah i thought that was ingenious it is it is it's a great hack i love it so um yeah so we did we just got asked to post in the um which newspaper uh it's like that neighborhood news so we did write the the one with the heavier paper so i did write up a blurb for the halloween event because that's before the chili cookoff so when it comes to it we will i will put something together for the um the chili cookoff and you know we'll put it in there nicole always posts on next door neighbor app facebook page um so yeah we'll definitely keep posting there and then again it's just kind of word of mouth like us our neighbors you know just and then they'll tell people and they'll tell people and hopefully it'll go from there so kyle i think is going to give everybody 20 tickets today yes and um so what i did 10 people yeah yeah and i already have my 20 tickets so like um i'm going to sell mine i'm going to bring the money in i'm going to get more tickets i'm going to sell mine i'm going to bring the money in get more tickets and then paddy is going to sell them we're going to put it on the sign but like it's great because we all live at different parts of the city different ends of the city and nicole and i i know we live right next door to each other right across the street but we're going to be able to hit like you know what i mean like um and i you know pretty much in our group we have friends that like do do do do so i'm going to say hey you know kind of here's some information sheets pass them around and then you know have them call here or have them call i think my number's on there and just to try to get the word because again we we can put it on the big sign we can post it everywhere but not everyone's on that page not everyone looks next door neighbor app not everybody sees the sign because when you're driving so we're just gonna have to try to hit as many people as possible and then you know if you don't sell them you just bring them back it is what it is but like you know we're gonna do our best to try to you know because it's our first event ever that we're selling tickets to so we gotta see what works and what doesn't work i'm gonna print the tracker too right yes so i put a tracker together and it just says um i'll have patty or kyle email it out to you guys it just says print it right now okay that way okay so it's just a basic tracker so it'll say tim and tammy lavenda and then it'll say wine preference beer wine preference non-alcoholic and then there was one more thing i don't remember so it's good thing he's printing it out um or not pure soda water yeah it was non-alcoholic it was that so beer wine non-alcoholic oh and your wine right well you know we voted on wine city council voted on wine and then i talked to like a group of like 10 women they're like i don't drink any beer at all so then we are going to have some wine for just non-beer drinkers because there are i know a lot of girls that don't like beer i don't like beer but i can't stand it like if the tannins and the wine just don't go with chili yeah i get it find the right kind of wine to go with it and it's like if you mix you know a normal like cover or low with the tannins and chili you and i can't do that and i'm i'm not a wine no i don't know anyway people are drinking it we just have to make a good choice i don't know what's the right well you're gonna do red you're gonna do one we're gonna do one of each all of those yeah we're gonna do like it's not gonna be anything we're not to be serving 50 bottles of napa cab we're going to be serving 10 or 12 bottle dollar bottles of a california maybe like sonoma if we can get it for 10 or 12 dollars like no one is going to expect like fine wine at the chili cook-off so it's it's not going to be some very very good wine for 12 yes you do not need to spend just costco they have great wines yeah but we don't have well okay so when lynn was when lynn was here lynn had a sam's club membership that we could use through the city so like if we needed bulk they would go to sam's club i again gave my costco spiel many times and they're like we can't do costco how about i do costco and you reimburse me no so we've already gone down that road and like you know obviously it might change because lynn's not here but um kyle's only point that he's made over and over is and the reason why i put it on the tracker is like it'll help us to know how many people are coming how much beer and wine we need like because it's like say if only six people check the wine box then we know we only need like two or three bottles of each one because he's like i don't want to be stuck with all this stuff extra there's nothing we can do with it and so i'm like you save it for the only other thing you can do we talked about that though you can't save it for the next event like we have a couple events the bad timing is when you have don't have another event for six months we don't have any other events where we have a wine license we're not get there's there's nothing else where we're getting out the insurance or the license to to have it so we do have events but we're not having liquor or wine but didn't we vote not to do wine like i'm so confused we voted originally to to do it we talked about not having it because last time we were here i could swear that we talked about not doing wine and only doing beer and now we're going back to doing wine well it's like yeah we are and it's it i don't i don't think it was an official vote we kind of talked about i think you said i don't drink wine with chili and we're like oh yeah well it doesn't really matter but then like i talked about her husband and he wants gluten free all right right right okay kyle so what are we talking about we're talking about that i feel like we're i'm a new member so i just want to make sure that we have the right kind of rules in place because this is this this board is governed by sunshine law so i want to understand that you know the notes didn't have any of this in here we had the dialogue we weren't going to have wine then we talked about having gluten-free beer because your husband was here saying he doesn't can we just get a few bottles of gluten-free beer even cider we talked about hard cider and now we're going back to having wine and then i understand we can't buy the wine at costco we can only buy the wine at sam's club like where does it say that so i i just want like proper documentation if the board makes a decision we vote on it we're gonna have we're not gonna win i don't think we voted i think it was just a discussion discussion discussion so why did we just reopen it like just because you have four girlfriends that you want it wasn't my girlfriend's it was like a group of people so so are we now we're now gonna have wine for four people that only drink wine so you can go back to the city council voted on a beer and wine event and we had a second discussion about it that's why we're doing it so we're going back to the reverting to the original decision which is harder to execute on because now we have some red some white how many bottles we could have left over it's a pain to do that and now i guess we can see what we come up with with this right like who what they choose and then go like off of that because like right now it's like mine no mine i think this will be the tail like this will tell us like true facts like this amount of people paid to have wine and whatever that's just my thought on it because i i don't drink any of that so i have no idea so yeah that's we can see what comes back with the tickets and right but it's more important to me that like we document things and that if we because we have this dialogue i had to take 20 minutes last time when we talked about getting the cider and getting gluten-free cider and then none of that's documented in our notes and now some group just decides to change everything and have wine again even though we talked about not having wine so i just prefer that we have documentation for what this group decides rather than um so we don't it's kind of a discussion i mean if you want to take an official vote at this point i think we did i think we talked about it but we didn't officially like set it in stone because last meeting we still were going through ideas and we got input from the outside and it was just kind of like no we didn't like land on like this is what we're set with so now i see your point um but i think for what we have is just like we should try to go forward and see and then just if we want to vote on it we'll just vote on it right okay and so we can't buy wine any place other than so then a comment was said i said we can get great wine at an affordable price at costco we can't buy at costco no i explained to her i remember kyle explain the lynn situation we don't the city itself doesn't have a membership so for us to get our tax exempt and purchase with our credit card we need a membership okay so they used to have a sam's membership so you purchased for the city through sam's membership okay so now that he's not here can we open that or like um it wasn't actually he just used his membership to be able to purchase there it wasn't an actual city membership okay so what are we going to do to buy the wine wine where do we choose to buy the wine we're not going to over complicate it we're just going to find a vendor to file the line if this preference is within this group you can make recommendations we can decide that way but okay yeah as long as it's a reasonable price and it works for us purchasing so much not having too much surplus it's it's going to work okay and you have to understand because this is our first time doing anything with beer and wine that there are going to be lots of discussions and it's going to change six times and we're not going to hard vote on it until we get closer and we kind of get a feel but when we presented to city council when we talked about it for months it was a beer and wine event so one time it comes up where you know and i understand but if you talk to 30 people you're gonna find someone who only drinks white zinfandel someone who can't have gluten someone so it's like it it's not our preferences on what we drink it doesn't matter what you drink with or what with chili or you no no i'm just saying or me or her and said why are we ordering wine nobody drinks wine with chili and that's what's on the whole discussion my issue is not whether we have wine or not my issue is that we're not documenting what our decisions are and what we're talking about like there was nothing in the minutes about a 20-minute discussion about having gluten-free not gluten-free so we're like not documenting stuff and that's no insult to you i just feel like we're just not documenting it and there's been other things that not been in the meeting minutes that i know we talked about and like even right now we jumped all over the place we didn't talk about the brick walkway we jumped back head to the chili cook off we didn't talk about the halloween event so we're not like documenting stuff and that i'm a person that i really need to be able to go back and see okay well this is what we talked about at this meeting and this is what we decided and so can the citizens that's okay well yeah so we're a little bit off the agenda right now and i don't even remember how we got there because you're talking about the beach cleanup and saying oh that's how we got there and then yeah yeah so i didn't really mean to take it off topic but we did kind of give a presentation on the chili cookoff at beach cleanup so anyway does anybody have anything else on beach cleanup okay so item agenda um number six is the brick walkway location recap so kyle i'm going to so i came up with three different options sort of like we talked about and i laid them out i think well let me just present them and you guys can decide but so the first one was sort of well this is kind of the original what we talked about like a 102 brick border along the path slash circle i'll pass it around and i kind of wrote out like how many bricks you know for that span if you did like a two brick uh border which would be one foot of brick you'd be 198 of total bricks um this one was more of like sort of an extension of off the circle uh i guess the purpose would be something you know for the wedding rentals or something like that it would give like a little standing area but this one was a 10 by 20 foot area which would be roughly 900 bricks which is a lot and then the last one which kind of came up late but it was a good idea about putting pavers around the sign there currently there's stone out there but there's a nice area it's flat um it's already sort of been graded out where we could start leaving with a border and then fill it in as we go and if we were to go like in the area roughly where the stone is now it'd be about 10 by 20 less the sign area so you look at about 350 bricks but again we don't have to do 350 bricks right away um we could we could build out or we could just do like a one border and then sell the bricks and then kind of keep building on it and keep it looking looking nice because it would be sort of like a a border with the stone in the middle and as we sold bricks we could fill it in this is the sign you said the benefit for that would be because of the way the areas with the stone you'll at least do like one brick border and keep it looking like aesthetically pleasing as we you know sold with bricks you know just so it had a finished look to it without having to put a whole bunch of pavers in is this the first one we talked about that they had the two side by side yeah so that was more like just a border running along the pathway and again we can change it around i just kind of threw it through together with the ideas is this a wall or is this no it's just a flat paper area because it seems to me that we wanted to have it in a place where most people would be able to see it just doing something noble and i don't know um initially i thought oh we could do it right out front here for the entrance and see all these steps and all that work and have a nice private paperwork but i don't think people come in that door anymore get a lot of people that walk on that sidewalk but not as many that are walking in sometimes it's hit or miss people that come here more often um tend to use the back and then people that come just to get like a beach pass they do park in those four customer parking spots and walk around the front i see more often but you do still still see it let them go around the back as well and how about the where the helicopter pad is yeah that was the first one that's just from the cul-de-sac area off of uh harbor 9th street harbor around the whole good is to be a lot of bricks i mean that's two bricks border and you're at 198 so i guess you i mean it's not something that's crazy this is actually more but um yeah if you were to cover that whole area i don't know so you come all the way up you probably so i was just talking about the hell got repaired all around like just during the circle just like on the yeah yeah it's an option too i don't know yeah the idea of the one around the sign but i don't think many people will see it because you would have to make yourself go up there and look and you would be looking for where people walk is here and not i don't know how many go down to the initially i thought gee that's right out front of the steps and be a nice place but where do people actually [Music] i see more people coming down the sidewalk at causeway boulevard but there is i'd say probably two-thirds of the people come down the sidewalk of kazakh boulevard but there's probably still a good chunk that coming off harbor drive and they're using that walking easement so i don't know if they're coming all the way from indian rocks so it just depends on i think where people live whether if they're going up the gulf boulevard to causeway or they even know about these and coming the other way but i'd say the majority still come on the sidewalk from cosmic boulevard golf that's where most people throughout the morning so up front you're talking about her out front yes yes more people pass out front on the sidewalk by the sign up to up to now i actually what i'm trying to say is most people come this way right here um some people come up this way but everybody is either and then there's some people on this side but if you're crossing that area they're on the main sidewalk i know we have done stuff yeah back backyard we had people walking up that that pants here but that's only when we have some kind of activity sure and you know people are going to have a paper brick somewhere in their memory or in memory of a wedding event or something like that then we have to figure out where they're most likely to see it tell their friends oh yeah we bought a brick that's right out there in that patio that you're sitting on i don't know i'm just trying to think of where it would be most appropriate i just feel like we the 198th though is there someplace like what if we have spillover i know we're not going to sell 198 bricks like right away but in five years 10 years like will it be grown to continue it yeah you either go around or go out wider so what what our next steps you present this to the council put it and you know another thing i think over here is um if you were to come out this far this is the the right of way for the county is pretty much right at the edge of that sidewalk so you'd be in the right way okay how many people think this is a good idea anybody no which one is that around the sign yeah that's how you have to do it okay now we're down to these two here we go for we mix well we didn't mix but we at least got those opinions on that for now so now down to the places where there's the most visibility i like the walk away idea i still think i like like lining a lot but i do i like lining the walkway ideal idea i'm not adverse to either one though it's not something that if i were buying bricks from my family right now i almost wouldn't want it up front i don't know why i feel like that's too this is the stairs against the stairs yeah so yeah seeing i like that area right there right in front where just right in front before you come up the stairs start with what are the little um concrete they're like three by twos or three by four you know yeah like right out here out the window like so you got like the garden bed that's right to the side of the stairs oh right there yeah the regulars yeah the sidewalk is closest to us yeah and then it comes right up to the stairs right well you've got from the sign to the that way and you've got it saw the end it turns down in little um this interior grass area yeah well no this whole no this sidewalk you don't have the sound off this so like divide it into um sections like that right yeah so you only have to replace one section at a time when you put and you know you could have one brick in there and you the neck the one in front of it could have five bricks because as you're adding two i'm not good at explaining things but i think you're saying pull the whole slab and then yeah she will pull the whole slab out and then when somebody bought a brick you would put it would engraved or etched or whatever it is and put it back okay anyway asked lloyd he knows how when i explained it to him he got it okay so like i don't know it's probably he thought it would be the easiest as far as replacement things you know adding and taking away kind of things sure but would you saw cut the whole slab yeah it was something about you would take the whole slab out and put as many as you were gonna put in you fill it up like i don't know i don't know okay that's what you're saying it might be easier to do a section at a time yeah and it would always look complete as opposed to um because on the flip side of this kyle kind of mentioned like say if we pick this one and you get you sell six bricks so it's one two three well to put plain bricks all the way around have a company do that and then replace them as it goes so the project always looks finished is going to be a huge expense to put it in to have it torn back out for something that's especially if we go all the way around that would be what does that say 190 so like just let's say let's double it and say it's 400 bricks so we have to pay it meaning the foundation would have to pay a company to put 400 plain bricks in to take them out so it look it doesn't look half finished at any time so that's also a consideration just because i don't know if that's a possibility right now and like i just think the worst thing that we could do is say we sell 30 bricks and you know i mean we don't have anywhere to put them yet so does that make sense and that's the way you explained it to me so we also have to keep that in mind as we look at projects that are 400 bricks and i understand we're looking at 10 15 years down the road like say whoever takes over the foundation like they just continue it and we continue to sell the brick program you know maybe one day we've used all three spaces you know what i mean you never know what we can use or that's a lot of bricks it's a lot of bricks but you know it's a lot of years you know or it could fizzle we just don't know so it's like to pick a place initially those are just things that we also need to keep in mind on the back side of it so when you said take out a section that's maybe 60 bricks and just do one section at a time that almost seems more manageable to me yeah that's an option we'll stay out of the right way over there which is good um and it's right up front we can place out however many bricks we're gonna be able to fit in there and then it'll be nice and snug and when people come for weddings they have to walk that way anyway because that's usually where the wedding is right and then you see all the wonderful brothers people that have you know donated to the city and i just like it being right up front that's just the person you know if you want do you want to start this way or you want to start that way i just i just know when we talked about it and and lloyd was here you know we were looking out the window and then he and i walked around talking places afterwards and he was saying how it would be so much easier just to do one of those sections every time whether you know i don't understand the next section okay and then at the end of the day like best case scenario we come up with our two favorites and then that's what kyle presents to council because we want to give them options and they could come up with 10 other things just like we are and at the end of the day it's not our decision well i do like it when you kind of like narrow it down yeah we've gone through all these options and then they don't have to come up with anything yeah yeah like if we just lay it out this is what the park and recreation board thinks would be a good area what if i want to buy bricks and decide i was going to buy bricks for wedding or my grandson's wedding or something like that but only if it's on the end of 20th street park something that's movable i think that's like if you wanted something that is a legacy item you can buy like a bench or you know a tree or something but the brick is really like i think it makes sense to have the burps here again i've seen it really done well my alumni association had it done beautifully and it was right outside of the clubhouse for the alumni and you know they all different sizes it was really beautifully done so that's like so we're going to turn people away today they want brick style and they're pant 23 part well what's the profile yeah i mean if you were like hey i want to buy that close to that many bricks but i want them down there you're gonna buy them all at once i guess we could probably make something work but we can't have single random bricks all over the city i mean this is the start of our breakfast because that kind of sounds like what you want to do like you just want to buy one brick but you want it down by the park where they got married did you say 20. you put a plaque in them that's a lot of bricks you'd be better off buying a plaque or something that's more durable and it's already got two packs there yeah so anyway that's where we are on that so i don't know do we need to come up with a final recommendation today okay in october okay so the idea is so we like kylo weight do you want to throw which to or do we want to just make a recommendation this is what we thought i mean how do you guys feel about what we discussed as far as cutting out some of this my favorite two are these two like i don't if it's not around the sign that's okay if we start with one like if we move that little square over here and go with what she went i'm you are in the middle fine either way um started on like the square again what about if we start with the one like you know how the you get off the sidewalk yeah and it comes like totally you're coming towards the library or the sign the first square past that little gritty like the handicap yeah sensor because the square is kind of like right in the middle and then we can always turn so start there right where the east the cut lines are yeah and come this way yeah i mean we don't have to do that whole slide right we could do a section on that slide just start yeah yeah okay so what she's proposing is starting here this first cut line and then we would figure out the proper block of bricks and start there but that doesn't interfere with the walkway does it and people think the people won't be walking on the bricks yes that's right yep i mean that's just like it um gardens and all those how they have sure donators and they're just sporadic you know you'll just see oh there's a you know donated by so-and-so in memory of her we're like that all right um i i don't feel like we're ready to make a motion yet to make a formal vote so do you guys if you feel like you know what the two your two choices and you're ready to vote then we can move forward i know what i would vote for george knows what he would vote for nicole are you yeah but whenever we make the final decision on what kyle needs to present to council then we can make a motion on it if not then i don't know who makes the decision on what we present but he said needs it today yeah yeah okay okay um so let's do it like this how many of you want this one just show hands one two three okay could you please hand me that one how many of you like this one [Applause] i would love it if it was a wall i don't know why it's on the ground okay and now this one we have two options we have the section of the sidewalk like taking out the the box or we have around the sign so we're going to do two boats on this one so let's start with the sign because that was one of our original to go around the sign that already has rocks so all they would have to do is put the bricks in take the rocks out and then kind of fill it in as they go so it would already look complete or at least you know finished without having to put any plain bricks in to take them out does that make sense so the first thing we're gonna vote on is the area around the sign so who likes that nobody okay um who likes the sidewalk square in the front where we just take out a section of the sidewalk that's what that one was for now those seconds went after the pass nobody likes this one this isn't nobody likes his office that was done oh so you thought you were voting on oh okay that's this [Music] okay so you didn't mean to vote for that one okay so yeah so this has got the front section of this is the front of the building the front section of the sidewalk and then the front section around the sign so nobody likes the sign i i do i'm going to vote one of my votes going to go for the second because we have to vote for two and then the sidewalk section me you george what do you think about the sidewalk i don't know which one we're voting the sidewalk in the front keep changing it no we have to go right outside the front door here the sidewalk right outside the front door before the steps if we have to vote for two my second choice would be around the side because i don't know why i can't visualize walking on somebody's name like in memory of i don't want to walk on it gotcha and then the section of the sidewalk in the front of the building one two you do you know where we are george see this this has this piece of paper has two choices one is the original which is the sign and then right so i didn't give you a vote for that okay but i don't think i have you down for i have you down for this so you only voted once i need two votes from you so can i vote twice for that question no nice try buddy this is the table scenario you got a second choice you only have one choice well so we have three for the section of sidewalk we have two for around the sign you added around the sign if i had to pick the second choice my second choice would be around the sign well we can always just give council one choice but i don't know if that's because we're kind of like well this is all we like and if you don't like it we're back to the drawing choice okay well you know we actually have with everyone not really voting twice because they don't want to we have three votes for the section of um the sidewalk in the front and we have three votes for the pathway okay so is everybody good with that yeah okay so um how do we get six volts votes because not everybody voted okay okay that's good as long as you guys agree with it so we'll make a motion i agree how do we get six phones it would be so great if we just see what it would look like you know they have that software and stuff which we obviously don't have the way that we can visualize what it would look like is there any way to do that because really we had eight not really because there were two for the size do you have like names for these so i can't put them in the nose crushers so here's a sidewalk i mean i isn't that like just like that you would walk on it's like disney world disney world doesn't care they walk all over and then they put the trash can over ourselves they did no they don't they have money in there but this is going to look much more like this like how many bricks across versus the walkway which is only two across right it will look very different how many bricks would we envision would go into they bounced about 60 would go yeah yeah well that just came up two by side okay yeah the other ones too side by side it just kind of goes up and around yeah yes and then the one it would just be like more of a rectangle so it might be say it's 20 20 up and down 30 across to be that wreck just for right what are you talking about bricks so it's not 20 by 30 inches it's 20 by 30 like 20 bricks by 30 bricks what are we talking about right now like she's like i wish i could picture it and i said so say it's um it's wider than it is tall so it'd say it's 30 bricks wide and 20 bricks tall visualize it which is a very different look than going yeah but that's it's not gonna be that many that's it's not i'm just giving her an example so she can visualize um i don't know the number it could be ten by twenty or fifteen by thirty i don't know the actual number but that just it's wider than it is eight inch right yeah eight inch that's how big of a cut area you know you could go maybe 10 to start with 80 bricks fill it in you know i just think it would be helpful if you have to present it to say something at 20 bite it'll be 20 feet something because it is such a different aesthetic like just having two side by side going along 70 feet versus having 60 feet and 20. i mean i can get um i can measure it yeah we can figure it out yeah approximately but i guess i'll just send it out hey you guys go with this because the space is already exactly measured for us we're literally just cutting out the same section of the sidewalk so it's it's not like we have to figure anything out it's done for us and it's got to match the rest of the sidewalk exactly so it's not like we can make it wider or smaller it's got to fit into that exact lineup so it just looks nice i would think yeah and the best way to do that you'd have to kind of play with breaks across okay you know what i mean okay all right so i would you showed in the pictures um here you got like that bottom corner like you could either you could leave sort of like a concrete border like she was talking about put the bricks in the middle yeah i mean only so wide down the center just to leave concrete on the edges yeah and then you don't have to walk on it a little bit better than having to walk on it well some people would walk on it i know it would be in the middle yes yeah oh yeah i like that i didn't quite picture it when you catch it i like that idea that makes it more yeah so we have to saw cut and pull it out um do you know how thick it is probably between four and six inches okay so not much more than what the bricks are yeah okay we would just put some kind of base down and with some sand sand okay yeah i like that that would look nice because then it would still be uniform with the it would still just like blend into the rest of the site yeah okay so we'll look at it and come up with an idea and you want to email it out email it and say this is what i figured can we vote by email or is it okay that we voted and you're just going to let us see it let me unless you're like that's horrible do this instead so we have the two choices that we can go to the council with with recommendations you're going to send out what they visually look like and then the right way yeah okay um and then so you guys think about pattern two um we could just to make it easy and square you could do something sort of like this in the middle you know if you were to imagine you know two two you know what i mean so like that way you weren't doing half bricks um or you could do something like uh see if you do that uh apparent phone yeah see that most of the layouts are like that's probably the easiest way to do it because if you start doing like you know like you know fitting in with the herringbone design then it might be um have we picked out what the actual brick looks like tammy like this versus the lighter color versus a darker color or or do we need to that's nice that's next on the list so where to put it and then potentially and again these are all just recommendations honestly it's like it's it's really not up to us we're just giving our opinions so we're putting a lot of thought into something like um that's why kyle printed all this stuff out so um yes so i laid out kind of like a pattern like this forgot how many bricks in the middle i'll throw that out at you um the color suggestion is this nutmeg full range it's lighter um which one this one it's hard to see though these two it's terrible honestly is there a reason though i mean i like it and i don't have a preference i'm just curious like is there a reason that we can say i can say the reason better for the rain yes the reason is on the lighter ones it'll show mold or you know how sometimes you get black like especially around here and close to the water so it'll hide that a little bit better and um two the sample that we have to show them is a very very dark and so like the black imprint doesn't pop as much as it would on one that's a little bit lighter so this is what the sample that they sent us you guys have all seen that it's dark and so um so that was the logic it's it's dark enough to not show a lot of weathered yucky growth and it's light enough where you can see the imprint are they slightly nuanced shades but then that it looks like it but i still can't tell them yes and that was why we thought it would blend in nicer with the sidewalk as opposed to something that's just one solid color it'll just kind of like especially if we do a border of the concrete because there's some lighter there's some darker but nowhere is it like this color which doesn't really go i mean like our building's not that color our logo is real light um so that was the logic for and then the recommendation this one it's gonna be just bricks built off of the edge of the sidewalk right um so i guess i could try and do sort of a visual of what that would look like um and then we probably could start with in that situation like maybe doing like um like brick and then you know like offset for two and that would be like that would be like eight inches because they're four inches each so maybe start like that um and it would be i guess as we go i see that the difference is though like with when you're cutting out the piece you know you're putting in so many bricks in and you have sort of a finished walk with this one i mean i calculated about well that's one foot so that'd be three rows of bricks so you're still doing 100 and i don't know 120 something bricks if you're ready to run i don't know what we're we're trying to get to a certain point or we're just you know what i'm saying i'm kind of having a hard time visualizing this because i feel like that's not a tripping point right if it's uneven it's on the ground it would be in the ground um this is gonna be harder to do right because you have grade as you go up it's not it's not flat that's something we should probably think about what are your thoughts why is a great problem um we'll just have to cut out into the ground and want the it just you might want to actually consider putting some kind of concrete retaining edge on it to keep it from wanting to slide out because this is going to be lower ground here it wouldn't be just like papers like when you do papers it would be like that i would just want to keep it and it's like do how far do we do we do a certain stretch of it and then you know because that way i mean we only need to change bricks and we can put tim breaks in if you're doing that problem right yeah yeah well and i guess the way i pictured it 25 more so can you just add one on that path yeah okay and i just thought they would be side by side and it would just be like an extension of the sidewalk or the so it's even all the way up like it would just follow it around like the whole staggering thing yeah it's just gonna have to be graded i just thought it would be like so just lay them out yeah i just thought it would just be an extension of what's already there so you just start with one line start with one line yes okay all right and then yep one right walking or riding on them they would stay all right yeah it would look like a trailer yeah like it's more decorative and people definitely wouldn't be walking on it yeah because it'd be over on the edge and superstitious it's going to be weddings it's going to be all different things so okay yeah so i'll try to put a little visual yeah take a close picture of each area and then put in some bricks so you can visualize these well i was thinking of though they're probably about three foot by four foot the rectangles are kind of yeah those are a little bit lighter so that'd be about 48 bricks because they're like eight inches you know so they'd be six across and eight that way that would be really manageable too [Music] yes okay so i'll put that together yeah we moved to the next time and i sent it to you and then you guys i know yeah it's and it's a lot and she made a motion stop talking i make a motion that kyle makes all the decisions any one second i'm teasing all right do you have enough info to work on i do okay so then we're going to move on all right are you planning sorry are you planning on presenting on this this week no it's october no absolutely sounds like so much it's too it's too late for that all right okay so item number seven is the halloween event um so that'd be good so um i reached out to dave gattis and um he was our mc last year he's going to be our mc again this year so that's cool and it literally took dave wendy and their son michael they did a great job like dave would make the announcements wendy and michael would kind of herd the cats like to where they needed to be so that worked great so um they're going to do that and then we need six judges and so i have a list of people i've been contacting i'm contacting the people that did it last year i've had um there's been some movement so right now there's only two confirmations out of six but i don't think it's going to be difficult to get four more people and then as far as the tables for park and rec we have um the sign up table which pat and rich benovito are going to take that table they did it last year and then we have the and that sign up table kind of turns into one of the treat tables where they're just kind of handing out bags of candy because obviously once everybody signs up that's kind of over with and then we have the cookie table slash hydration station so that's where the cookies and the water will be and then we have the whole section with all the dog water bowls which is just kind of off to the side of that and then we have the community table which kind of encompassed our first aid kit the speaker for the music our suggestion box what we need to decide we didn't sell merchandise at the halloween event last year so we need to decide if we're going to sell out merch sell the merchandise that we have and then if we sell it all out then we order new stuff for the christmas because so i mean laura's like people come in here looking for christmas gifts we need to have inventory so we don't have a whole lot of inventory left i think we have ten hand towels two or three miscellaneous t-shirts and tank tops of each size we have a lot of license plates but otherwise we don't have a lot really of anything this the hats have been selling pretty well so um i don't know what do you guys think this is just kind of a conversation at this point do you want to do a merchandise table does anybody feel strongly about it one way or the other i don't care okay the more opportunities we have you know people that can see you have a way to take for the venmo because i did see that in your post about the beach um i wanted to ask about that so when you posted about the beach and selling handhelds and stuff were we able to do venmo are we wearing because i thought you said you would have venmo there yeah it's an option but most people will pay cash and if they don't have cash then they know to just come up here okay so yeah but normally at events it's like we do cash only thank you i think in one instance the guy didn't have cash so he ven mowed me and i had cash in my wallet and i just paid nicole for him but as far as like credit cards or venmo at the event um through the city we really haven't found a way to do it yeah so it's just fashionable unless they they can pay with a credit card if they come here like during the week so i don't know i think we march yes everybody cool with merch okay all right is that a separate table no well that'll just be um we can just do it on the community table so it'll be the merchandise the speaker the first aid kit in the suggestion box because we aren't going to have a ton of inventory um do you guys have any preferences on where you want to be that day like nicole usually works the merchandise table george supervises everything that means i'm sitting somewhere giving donna cookies yeah well that's okay um do you have a preference on where are you anywhere you need me okay i'm just i have to say i don't have kids so i'm not like the greatest with kids so how about dogs i love dogs okay you can help her the ducks i'm good with all kinds of dogs fighting cats all kinds of pets where did you put them there with snakes sorry you said this side oh [Music] i know there's a lot of discussion on that last year nobody brought anything but dogs so it was okay like we were like we don't advertise an outside but we we had a couple people show we didn't turn anybody down there might have been kids yes absolutely there might have been three people and then if people had their grandkids and they lived here it wasn't even a thought i'm just saying the one couple that nicole talked about that was like the wizard of oz they missed like most of it because they drove like an hour and a half i don't even know how they heard about it but anyway so they didn't really get to enter because they were late and um so we're going to have kind of a hard line in the a little bit harder line yeah but yeah we don't really we don't advertise everywhere because we can't accommodate but we don't turn anybody away we really haven't turned anybody away at anything because we just don't want to be like that if that's okay um okay so how do you if someone gets quite private coming over from tampa or something like that how do you deal with that well we do we just tell them that they miss the sign ups yeah leave earlier no i mean but is there a way to pre-register people saying um we did a pre-register last year and no one did it like call city hall if you want to sign up no one not a single person called we had no idea how many people were showing up that day and we had a really good number so i so i think what you're getting at is if we have somebody from another town show up there would be no way for us to know that is that what you're asking george i was just saying if like last time people came hour late or something that they were all dressed up they were like an hour late like everything was over so cookies where do you get those do you bake them publix i don't bake them you just would get the desserts at publix just kind of like we do the donuts for yeah i mean there's other bakery choices but that's just seems the easiest for kyle to run across the bridge and if we run short he can go get some more i like publix just for the convenience yeah pretty much um okay does anybody have anything else any questions about that the halloween event so how many tables four maybe five oh and then if you recall last year we had the little girl from blood bella bluffs who she has her own business she does organic dog treats and so she had a table last year so she's gonna be back too well jules is gonna check and see if she wants to do it again last year it was cute she just gave out samples she didn't sell anything and she gave her business card and so if people like so she gave any dog that wanted it some treats and then if you wanted to buy some you could just call her yeah it was cute she did a good job um so we had four tables this year we'll have five because last year we didn't have a merchandise table to answer your question george so we're adding one more table and this is all outside yes and this is the only event that we have that is weather pending because if it pours down rain we can't turn half the people away which means all the dogs and the dogs can't come in the building so it is on sunday from four to six so setup is at three here and we meet the friday before and we set up as much as we can and we lock everything on this side so when we get here on sunday we can just come in and grab it and take it outside and it's mostly done the the most part is putting up the tents because um the judges tables we have two huge like you know those pop-up tents are under that well you guys saw the video so you kind of saw the setup from last year so to be similar we don't need to reinvent the wheel um there wasn't we moved things as to george's point we moved things so many times that we kind of figured out where everything worked and the flow of it and um the halloween event was pretty well placed because like you know the kids kind of lined up the dogs were everywhere so does anybody have any questions about that i see i picked the right job the dogs are everywhere well you can't line them up because they fight yeah it'll be amazing try i have a dog well i think it's like where um where like the emcee will go okay we're up for dog contestant number eight it's like you have to make sure doc contestant number eight is paying attention and gets where they need to be yep so is everybody good yeah patty do you have a choice on what table you want to be at whatever whatever is good okay sounds good to me um oh and we do wear costumes the judges wear costumes so i think we talked about that okay um [Music] item agenda number nine december 5th christmas event did we skip the chili cook off well we'd already discussed it but we kind of already discussed it i just have one question i don't have my glasses on so i did skip it and i already checked it go ahead all right so my question is how are we supposed to sell these if we can't take credit cards you're just kind of like taking names filling out the paperwork for them so if i tell my neighbor jim and carol you click on the chip chili come off how do i the bottom says credit cards taken at ballard city hall so i just give them the tickets or what do i do no if they can't pay you cash then they need to come up here and buy them from laura oh okay so i should take cash okay yeah thank you yeah and then when you sell them you just bring the cash to kyle and he'll give you more tickets if you want if they need to pay the ten dollars by credit card or want to or whatever then they have to come up here yeah so hopefully they have or they can they can always venmo you and you can pay the cash okay or paypal me or whatever okay cool yeah yeah all of those work i was just gonna kind of figure it out by person and then at the end of the day i was gonna bring up you know the cash to kyle yeah so you guys you should come back with a hundred dollars yeah it's a pretty easy math ten people um does anybody have any questions about the tracker it's pretty straightforward it's just a way to and then you don't have to but like we're gonna have a print out of the instructions that you have on email with the sign up sheet that they need to bring here and drop off or give to one of us to drop off at the city council meeting tomorrow they're gonna be on the table where they have the meeting notes printed out i wrote a list down of everybody i passed one of those out to so like i can follow back up around with them if we didn't hear from them are you a yes or no did you forget because you know people have a lot going on so they they may not remember they're like oh yeah i really want to do that but i forgot where i put the paper so i'm just kind of keeping track of who i hand the info out to we're not going to be able to do that for everybody if random people grab them at the city council meeting so be it but i'm just saying like i'm trying to keep track i just thought of something so my neighbors that never come to city council are now coming to city council tomorrow night um do we have any like what's the upcoming events there because i think that's an opportunity for us to advertise this stuff meaning like a big sign or something because you know how crowded they've been recently i mean the buoy thing brought in like so many people they've been really crowded and it's an audience that we might not otherwise get like is there a way for us to have a list of upcoming events or something because we could the chili cook office in november so the october one you have a little table there or something selling them can we do anything or we can't because that's really formal you don't want to like politics no i mean so that means cool if you want to put together some kind of little app it's got the events on it that people can take or oh you mean like a little card or something yeah or just like i mean we're going to have those this is actually what's all flying out too but i mean for tomorrow we're probably going to get in together today to the october meeting oh i'm sorry it's not tickets it's number be able to put the three events on something sorry i can see why you think this happens i mean there i told me you should have the boogie thing on it again thank you i think that would be so that would be okay to like have a handout saying these are our upcoming events yeah there's nothing wrong okay then maybe we can um have a hand on how people can see the events like chili cook-off the date how much it is something kind of what patty put together on the city newsletter yeah yes because i mean that sounds like exactly what you're talking about but like just to give them out at the because the people that read those i just started getting the emails but i know the last few city council meetings have been packed with people right and it would just be good to be able to give something out no it's a good idea yeah if you have an idea of like how you want to do it and you can present it at this next meeting we can bring it to the council meeting i'll do something you know powerpoint or whatever perfect yeah yeah if you want to send something and then i can check the details and finalize that we can send it out upcoming events posted by parks and rec for now the only one that's not to fight parks chili cook off do you did you want to put on that that it's not it's supposed to be interesting it's hosted by this one was the one that was going to be hosted by the bellar beach community nothing until next year okay so you have all the information like times and dates i think so okay and then i'll put it together and i'll send it to you okay if she got the email from patty from yeah like the city news i think everything's in maybe a half sheet like this one cycle say chili cooked off now they're usually a little more something like that so this is what we did so jazz in the park was one side and then we had all the rest of our events on the other that's what i won't be able to print it on this fancy paper but i did finally get my [Music] yeah so that's what we mailed out that cost twelve hundred dollars so it's much better to hand them out it's much more economical to pass them out i like the font and everything on this so great cool and then kyle can put the logo on and stuff for you okay and then um patty caught an error in my tracker so um just the number so it's just the number of tick um number of entries purchased so two entries to the chili cook-off is four tickets not two tickets does that make sense so like if i buy i give 20 bucks for my husband and i it's four tickets because it's you get chili and two drink tickets each so it shouldn't say number of tickets purchases say number of entries or you could just put number of tickets and then put four yeah which would then you don't have to scratch up tickets yeah no good catch i knew what i meant it just didn't get that way ten dollars two tickets per person yes ten bucks ten dollars all right twelve dollars at the door does anybody have anything else for the chili cook-off no okay perfect um christmas eve event um oh i'm sorry back up real quick the only thing i wanted to add was at the um the chili cook-off this the foundation we checked it out with kyle we're just gonna do a food drive for the month of november so it'll be in city hall for the whole month and then obviously it'll be at the chili cook-off if people want to bring their canned goods or whatever and then so we'll have it from november 1st to november 30th and then the food will be donated and if it piles up people on the foundation will go drop it off or have them pick it up so they'll just it'll be a box in the corner it's not like a big to-do and i was like so and that's why i wanted to get it so there's going to be the food drive um when is it november first yes okay and they basically want like canned foods candor normal stuff non-perishable yeah who's the charity um you know what we're researching it so we'll we'll the sign for the charity will be on the box box yes we're going to wrap it in glitter paper glitter the stuff that falls off and corner what are the cornucopias and pumpkins and fall leaves just spray some elmer's and fill the glitter oh i'll put the chili cook off one more question i know you said you were you could not participate can we participate are we oh no i wait i'm gonna make a chili i just don't i can't i don't think i can win i guess i don't know we can that's one of those things where are you going to put in front of your crap i can't win so don't go no i don't feel that anyways this is what we went through with the halloween thing like can your child win and it was a whole yeah i don't even know what oh and we just said we just said no that was part of conflict of interest yeah it kind of that's why i said i'll enter a chili but i don't plan i think i just thought like say if someone votes for me then you just pull my name out and do the next person behind me and it's not even it's a nonsense spoons well and i thought it was a 50 amazon gift card and that's true too like really how is that that that's a good way to do it like don't announce that you can't win but if you did win you'd say the nick the runner up actually takes no i just won't win yeah yeah not you yes yes we all know you want yeah it depends on which chili i make it depends on which one okay yeah so you everybody can everybody here can enter we're just gonna let i mean you know just say you make the most spectacular chili in the world you'll it'll go to the number two i mean i don't know because is dave gaddis going to be really everybody who's there is voting yeah it's kind of different than like at the halloween you had a panel of judges and you're you know i mean not the fact that everybody who's there gets one vote i don't know if there is a conflict yeah there's so it's not a monetary prize it's like is there a monetary but then again i'm just saying that i think we can trust that people are just going to vote for what they like without being like a popularity con right i think everybody could hold their own on like i voted for this because i really liked it you know you know what i mean i don't know if it's gonna be quite the same as like when you only have so many judges and then there's kids i don't know well didn't we talk about this a little bit last time this isn't dave having a chili yes so if dave's happening in chile i think it's that's fine i think you should just look at your excuses okay because everybody there can vote once yes absolutely however it goes it goes there there we go all right well do we need to make an emotion or is everybody go with that discussion we're good we're just gonna everybody can it's an open free-for-all anybody can win unless we should check with our lawyer i'm sorry i'm a business person it all comes down to does it give the appearance of an impropriety but i think if the mayor can win anybody if the mayor's win anybody can win but should the mayor be able to win that challenge i don't know do you run it by the city well that's why if you read anything it says that the entry should be anonymous but they can't be because the person is going to be serving the children if it was anonymous but otherwise is it their gift card like a 50 gift card i guess so i get a spoon and a gift yeah i don't know if we've got no amount but we did say gift card in the spoon all right how much is it 50 bucks yes and they're all equal because they're not like first second and third so it's not like we have to have 175 and 50. it could be 50 50 50 because you got yeah they're all they're all winners um kyle i don't think it'll pose a problem but let's check up on we'll go with that we'll just ask the lawyer yeah i don't tomorrow night can we ask him casually because i think it's not if this is a small little microcosm you know something that could be bigger in the future and it's just good to know what the rules are like if it's under a hundred dollars it's de minimis and we don't have to worry about it but if it gets to be something more significant than just have the protocol sure it should be good objective okay now i will say since i remember the food drive are we all good with the chili cookoff okay all right item number nine oh my gosh um december 5th is the christmas event um as nicole was explaining it's just a one hour like just a little holiday cheer we don't do alcohol we just have like um we had hot chocolate and um you know sweets and we did have christmas carolers last year but it was kind of a waste of money just because if they were singing outside you couldn't hear them in the building and then as they walked into the building so it's not like you could have christmas music on because then they would walk in and sing so we're just going to do christmas music but we are going to do for the month of december a toy drive so that'll be toys for tots so it's going to be like not where you get susie who's 14 who asks for a playstation it'll be just bring an unwrapped toy any age and then we will hand them off to toys for tots and then they can distribute them yeah so we i don't want to make it where we're pulling names or adopting families or anything it's too hard so it's just gonna be please bring an unwrapped toy if you would like just because we don't have a lot of kids here but then we can you know um and then yeah like nicole said we had one refreshment table and we had a merchandise table and so like patty had this really cool i had never seen them before i'm sure they're popular but it was like a wrist wallet like where you put your phone in your money if you run or you walk that it's like you know instead of a fanny pack and so um we were thinking if you guys like it so this is the first time we've ever seen the logo the beller beach logo with us just the black and white outline of it so and it's not silk screening or iron on i don't i maybe it is silk screen but it would be very similar like this oh yeah but not glittery oh why not do the glitter yeah that would be if if the thing that she has is like neoprene or like that polyester yeah it's probably gonna be it's probably gonna be this like vinyl and it could just be the black outline and that would be less expensive and then it could go on every color because i looked i ordered a five pack today from amazon and i got a black a blue maybe a black and white kind of you know that little granite looking thing and then there might have been a maroon one and a navy blue one so black would go on any and it would be kind of gender neutral and they would probably be under four bucks and we could maybe sell them for 15 or something like that i mean we could get to it but we need to do some more research it was just a thought but so kind of brainstorm if i could have i would have sent you all an email out saying please brainstorm because like we're going to run through the merchandise that we have and we got to come up with at least two or three things people keep asking for beach towels so i did some shopping we haven't been able to find white nice beach towels that we can afford for a year so i finally found some these mama jamas are really nice nice and then the biggest ones that we have they have them on amazon and subscribe and save for like 13 and change so we could probably do it and still maybe sell them for 20 or 25 bucks we've been selling them for 20 but we can still reach our price point that we need to be at and um they offered them in like 20 colors so hopefully stock is not an issue but um they fly every time they fly those we had white first and those flew and then we we couldn't get them anymore they were all like 30 35 bucks a piece we could not find a towel without charging people 40 after the logo was embroidered on it so we finally found some under 15 which are not they're shitty i have another example over here i have ordered 20 bags of crappy white towels that i just keep sending back because we're not putting our names on those i mean it's embarrassing like they're really bad um so if you guys are good with that like i said hopefully we sell out what we have at halloween and then we come up with maybe two or three things other than our standard like they've been selling hats for years they've been selling um license plates for years that was all before us um you know the t-shirts and the towels and the hand towels and stuff like that has kind of been like what we've been doing i remember um who was it the bags like these little bags yes i don't know if these would be i paid 25 bucks for my park steady pack yeah it's cute i think you can make a nice margin on it i know we don't look to make you work it but you could remember i think it was um jules had seen my back and said that this could be something that we can maybe do pretty cheaply i don't know if you can buy that on amazon but these i love them they're good for the environment she was looking at them on zazzle is that the is it zazzle za's easy ellie yeah so they're not bad we were also looking at the ones and i didn't bring it in today i brought it in before it literally folds up to something this size it has a zipper it would have the bellar beach logo on the outside of it you unzip it and it turns into that so like say if you're going to a market and you don't want to carry that big thing around because you don't know if you're going to find something um it it literally compacts down into that they kind of sell them everywhere now like um so that was another thing that we were looking at which was tote bag-esque yeah um but yeah like i said brainstorm but like the towels depending on how back ordered mosston's is like you know and kyle's like oh if they have inventory that's ordered then tell us now just because we've had issues they could be gone yeah so um i know it's september but it's coming you know i mean so it's like i am always about being early and having it in hand as opposed to waiting to the last minute and panicking and not having anything so and then if there's something's wrong with it we have time to fix it so you know in the next couple weeks if you think of anything i think if we get them ordered by like the first two weeks of october we should be in good shape um and obviously kyle can do the towels anytime because we've already done those we know how those sell he does the embroidery on it boston's over there it's right next to bel air market like it's in that same strip mall as like disease yeah then who would do like because i forget they have to be like licensed to do our stuff right like like saying like who would do the silk screen or whatever oh we have to find somebody yeah but they just would be able to do it like if we provide them with them yeah that's what's factor image well we're hoping we can provide them with the logo and the the item to put it on cool beans um again that's something that's gonna be a neighborhood that's something new well you know what like the company that kyle ordered these things through the ones that we did that were white with the beller beach logo on it would be something very similar to that he may be hmm those came out good they did nice people loved them they were happy yeah we did ballard beach ones for jazz in the park jazz in the park and we gave them out it was like a thank you for coming gift it they were nice yeah and um we had 100 it was kind of first come first serve because we didn't know how many people would show up um so yeah it was people i don't think we really ran out we just gave it was a comfortable amount it's just it was like the perfect number it was the perfect number so anyway does anybody have any other questions about the christmas event we have some time on that one i just like wanted to see if anybody came up with anything or had any thoughts on it that one like nicole said earlier is pretty simple um now what time of day is it it's the one hour before city council meeting so it's from five to six so like you have last year it didn't turn out because like they were still in the city council meetings so like the people that came like they didn't you know we had a really good crowd but it wasn't the same people that attended city council if that makes sense yes perfect not last year so hopefully you know we were because we were thinking everyone's coming here anyway so just you know like come here a little holiday cheer um it would be nice to be able to have a glass of wine we talked about that but not before a city council meeting because they're doing business and so it's like and if you lately they've needed some wine before during and after these city council meetings and setup is at four right setup is around top models at have been better than reality tv the last yeah that's why i suddenly go to all of them but they haven't been interesting vino caldo make hot wine that'll be lovely hot spiced wine yeah we could do something like that yeah okay so what do we want to do hot chocolate for the hot cider because we haven't you can't give up i have two crock pots or i don't know how you did your hot chocolate we did a dispenser like with the spicket we only have one and we did coffee no we didn't do coffee nor mixed it all up we have like hot chocolate and cookies or something and we had little cupcakes and little petaphores we just did really like little mini bites of all their christmas stuff and it was pretty you're laughing at donna's donna had like icing like upper nose it was so cute she was so she was holiday cheering for sure so we want to do just one drink or two or we only have one dispenser right we only have one so we just have to guess make a bonus can't do it like in a crock pot and please ladle it like you can keep cider that that's why i do it christmas i actually have everything ready night and farm because it's morning and it makes the whole house smell soon oh i bet it smells really good yeah i mean i think my drinks all that much my crockpot's a chicago bear so i'm not going to donate my crock pot but like you need to find some plain silver or red favorite but i don't know how big it is i don't know if it's big enough to do it i would be happy to volunteer i never use it yeah i mean we could do that absolutely because i want to say that dispenser was like 60 bucks and you probably don't want to have another one like hanging out if we could do it in a crock-pot so yeah i mean i don't have a problem um if does anybody else are you guys good does anybody have an objections to doing two hot drinks and then we did cold water because um you know sometimes it's hot here in in december so it's like yeah and then other times it's cold so it's like you know it's kind of a crap shoot whether the weather is going to be so um yeah i'm good with any of that i mean the more choices the merrier but it worked pretty well last year i mean people just dispensed their own hot chocolate so we didn't have to man the table like they just like we'd go up there every once in a while make sure that it was supplied and it was like nobody left their garbage or anything like that but like for the most part if um i don't know i kind of thinking with the ladle though we should probably do it i don't know if i i'm trusting people to go up there with hot liquid and to put it yeah i kind of see that as like spillage right george george can do it no i'm just thinking i'd be stuck between the cupcakes and uh not a good view with the fake ears oh there's so it's cute i can load it too first i've got a witch's hat well you got to wear that for halloween yeah it'd be a man witch will you be the elf you know like what's the guy's name buddy they'll help i don't know but yeah i know what you're talking about yes thank you i'm like it's not it's escaping me but anyways anybody have anything else in the christmas event we have some time on that one i just like it's good to talk about it because every time we come up with something new and um not different but you know just maybe like a tweak here and there which is good so okay all these let me just see if i can save advice i think for myself all the events coming up do we have a one-hour setup before that each event or the let's see it's in the meeting we talked about it and decided on yeah at the last week we said 1pm for the halloween of 1pm for the chili cook-off which would probably take one to two hours probably closer to two weeks and that's the day before a couple of days before the event and then the actual day of the event friday okay yeah i mean if you can it's fine as long as we know um we have like a a group of people like volunteers that don't want to be on the board but they definitely will help with stuff so um it's cool right not everybody can be at everything so all right um anybody have anything else good with that okay item agenda or agenda item number 10 um okay so this is real quick the january 14th health and wellness fair just a quick update as of today we have 14 yeses three no's and the rest are pending so that's 14 17 people out of like 25. so wellness way called me and dr alex were set i didn't hear from the dentist they are definitely they're a yes okay perfect and they have the sheet you gave it to them okay okay get it to both of them who did you say from well this way dr alex oh okay that's his partner yeah okay so say ryan ryan is and he's got a really long last name so i think he said dr a or doctor or doctor whatever he shortened it because it's true they're about i don't know well are they 30 something um and very sweet very sweet young man yeah so now we have 15 yeses now we have 15 yeses so today last year if you recall we had gold's gym um so and we talked about it they like you know they didn't work out that great so um today i got bake hair fitness wow so and daycare fitness oh good um spoke to the manager there today and um they've done them in the past they're excited to do it so the one thing that they did ask me he's like you know would you mind if i um had you know because normally when we do these things we bring our dietitian we bring our massage there's we bring all these things that we have to offer other than the gym well it was kind of um last year part of our selling point to get people to sign up for this was you're the only one you're the only dietitian you're the only gym you're the only massage therapist so what i told him is i will ask stephen the massage therapist you were packed from the beginning to the end and you could have stayed there another two hours with people on your table so he might actually like the a little a little bit of no i don't want to say relief but you know what i mean especially if we get more people this year because last year we had 80 if we have 250 people this year he wouldn't be able to even accommodate a third of them so um i'm just gonna check with him but if you guys are kind of okay with that me saying you know as long as the original person is okay with having maybe another dietitian we were always like we have a male personal trainer i told him i go you could if you have a female personal trainer because like sometimes girls don't like to work out with a guy or vice versa kind of thing so i figured you guys wouldn't really have an opinion on it if we have two massage therapists the more the merrier like where do i sign up so all right so yeah so that's that one again it's in january it's just kind of ticking along we started way early this year hopefully trying to get the mole patrol and we didn't get them anyway they were a no like after the last meeting so i think we have another dermatologist so as long as we have a derm because last year we didn't and i really think it's important that we have one um but there's so many categories we didn't have an eye doctor a foot doctor i mean we couldn't have one of everything in there we don't have space we kind of have to pick and choose um but i think a dermatologist is really important so um we are good on that does anybody have any questions have you found a dermatologist oh yeah what is it let me look at mine i did not it's not my germ because i tried my dream last year at florida dermatology there's like 14 locations they're almost too big to even um they were too big to even nail someone down because it's not my actual doctor that does the um i think you said this already damaged but that means that the ball patrol is not coming yes ma'am okay they were a no they emailed me like a week after our last meeting um i expect nothing less so it makes sense oh it's called bay dermatology dr hendrick hedrick h-e-d-r-i-c-k so they are pending i've emailed them this one is going through jewels a couple of them have gone through joe's oh and then um one so we got a no on the yoga and i haven't heard from the stand-up paddleboard yoga so possibly to replace them we have this kickboxing is that the clearwater one this i think the lady is like really nice she's from new jersey yeah beth yes yes i mean she's actually invited me to attend an event at her establishment but i got me crawling that's how i crawl at it it's tough it's really tough but it's a good class and you get six of gif i mean if she gives out the passes for six free classes i think that would be awesome um but i got this through the massage therapist they are in one of those like groups together like networking groups so awesome yoga because i can get a yoga i use the hot yoga the just26 that's right there and justine yeah so good have you been there i did recommend for ten years so yeah i went there until covid and then i stopped going because i just started going back but yeah if you if we want a yoga person i i love them it's woman owned um it's very very clean i highly recommend them i also got a hot yoga but yoga and largo but they're just they're both actually very close so if we want a yoga studio i can yeah um i i love bikram um i know she does other classes she's yeah she has a bunch of different modalities she does a lot of different kinds of yoga so yeah i have no problem with that if you want to contact her all right awesome do you need her number um i was planning on going tonight but oh okay yeah then have at it i'll put it on here yeah i really i like them i would like to grow their business it has a really nice feel to it it's a nice studio and they're not all hot where is it it's um you know where that like a little italian deli is it's on washington there's a little italian deli which by the way is excellent epilito's i love it it's been there a long time their food is excellent um this is in there it's across the street from like well the attack or the english store and there's like nails and it's called just 26 after the big problem but it's they do all different kinds of yoga types and they're good a little cool yeah do you hear from dollar coffee not yet calm down smelly don't worry we didn't lose the cord on that one still on the radar calm down sally remember the strongest coffee and people will be off the walls yeah they've definitely elevated since the last time we had them and then you're getting those uh peanut butter balls or whatever oh anyway that's jorgen um lindsey yeah they'll probably make those again and the b is 25 for the table yes do you have um oh here you can print it i have it right here in color you can take one of these thank you great and then i love the font i'll try to use the same font on our little well you're going to print it out on the fly you're going to do it about it no i'm going to okay and the other update that i have was that on sunday see our surfside produce closed so morgan sold the business to somebody else so they're reopening soon um so i'm gonna have to like back double back with the new owner and see if they want to participate if not i'll try to i'll try jams or i'll try i mean there's a million produce markets but hopefully because they're local and they deliver to bellar beach that we can get them the new owner to continue and i'll take um i'll show her a picture of what morgan did last year with like the samples and her charts and stuff like that but yeah i mean you know this is kind of going slow and steady which is nice um so by the time it rolls around we should be in good shape you have clean eats this year yep clean eats is good not yet but they will be any day any day i go by all the time hoping they'll open so i don't have to go to panera i spend twenty dollars for new food panera's got some panera is so expensive and you get no food they put like this much chicken salad on their chicken salad sandwich it's very true they're struggling um okay so everybody good with health and wellness nothing else okay other business um okay at a certain point now this is just like a brainstorming thing we don't have to decide on it now but at a certain point we have to decide what we want to keep because since we were here first we get to keep what we want and decide what we're going to hand over to the foundation if they want to do it then they can if not they don't have to but you know it was more kyle i'm going to let you cover this just for one second because you were kind of the one that said oh it would be better if the foundation did this this and this because it's not that it's easier but it's um less restrictive less restricted than if it's through plan sunshine law i just all of that stuff call each other yes and it doesn't you know like it doesn't all have to be vote voted on detail by detail by council because we're not spending council's money or city money so but it's still our meaning this board it's still our preference on what we want to keep and like what we want to hand over to the foundation and then they can kind of figure out what else they want to do from there if that makes sense so there's nothing we have to hash out today we're going to have several discussions on this and then we'll come to a final list but it's kind of got to be sooner than later only because or it's timely only in the fact that the calendar for the city will fill up with weddings and events and we have to pick dates yeah so what the foundation was kind of talking about was doing one event per quarter and um so like say if we we do whatever we do so it could be we're having an event and they're having events so we got to make sure that the dates aren't right on top of each other and all that good stuff so it's not a big deal but like once we get it kind of set then then we're in good shape and we can all just move forward because we can do different things that are more related to the park the actual parks and the beaches or like one example that we talked about at beach cleanup this last weekend so i guess once a year pinellas county gives out sea oats for free and there's one condo that's out there that they were out there planting sea oats you know so the erosion of the beach blah blah so it's like maybe for next september it would be something that the park and rec board if we wanted could like maybe contact the heads of the foundations because obviously this group is not going to get out there and plant sea oats for everybody we got to get buy-in from the condo associations and we need volunteers but like say maybe we can you know do the coordinating of it where like all the sea oats we can get all the sea oats here i don't know where they pick them up and this is kind of later on down the road but we do more for we do more stuff like that like say if we give our september we did jazz in the park last september we give that event to the foundation because liquor blah blah then we do the co project does that make sense so we can maybe branch out and do things like you know george how many park and rec boards have you been on five or six yeah and they've all focused on different things yeah yeah so like you know we kind of went um towards the social aspect a little bit i mean we did do stuff with parks i mean we do the surveys we do the beach cleanup we do do things with our parks and beach accesses or whatever but like if we give certain social activities to the foundation because it's more flexible then we can maybe take on more and you would be great at some ideas that maybe worked in the past that may really made an impact on the city or it seems to me that we should discuss what kind of things would be done by the foundation versus because we couldn't do them here because if they have liquor or something like that that makes more sense to the foundation or some type of program which would raise money but we we couldn't do it without group that should sort them all out and say okay what's going to work for us and what's going to work for the foundation and not just pick and choose right now say well we can do this and we could be that one we need to give them this one because we can't do it right and that's a good point because it's like we're i mean we are trying you know with the chili cookoff to sell tickets but we're not trying to make money anything that the foundation is going to be doing is going to be to make money towards a project for the city and then you know everyone will know what that project is where we're just saying okay thank you so much for being residents thank you for being here we're being social we're giving stuff away we're not trying to make any money the foundation events will be all like we're trying to make money and you know here's your tax receipt whatever if you want to make a donation or sponsor that event so that's why like we can do the events we can we can have liquor you know we can do almost everything but we haven't tried to make any money so the the ones that we could make more money should probably go to them because it's just going to circle back around to the city anyway it's not like we're trying to make money for things in you know i mean another country we're trying to raise money for funds that will do something really good in our community so um it's it's just us picking like you said if we don't want to do the social events anymore and all the social events if we want to take that category and give it to them and then we do more environmental parky things um and say say for example we only keep um the halloween event and christmas and health and wellness fair and then we then we recreate the wheel we recreate our you know our one thing a month or whatever or a quarter into something different or we don't i mean the um yeah it just seems to me that we need to think through carefully what we want to do with this group versus but yeah take this we'll give you that this could be that yeah like a conceptual framework like when it fits into this category it's better off done by them but when it fits into this category it's better like what are the why are we doing this why we why are we giving up this when it's you know something we like to do we don't have to go to the foundation right yeah no we don't have to give up anything it was just there like i said it was mentioned because kyle said there are things that would be more flexible if they did it like you know where there can be a lot more communication as opposed to everything going through the city and back out yeah i think any other like those musical events with selling the beer in line and do better with this foundation doing it yeah the social stuff honestly and we can't even profit if we do profit from from alcohol sales we have to donate it anyways it's part of our temporary permit stipulation so you know you guys get a since you're a 501 3c you can just profit all your wax it goes right back into your foundation and kyle did mention that he would prefer if the foundation took over the merchandise sales like um especially you know so it's like and he we also kind of discussed like where we would be able to keep things like the towels the things that don't have sizes colors if you don't have a choice straightforward stuff yeah i want a towel it's 20 and it doesn't take any of their time that we can keep it here but everything else will only be sold at foundation events so they ha if they want a bellar beach t-shirt or a tote bag or a wrist wallet they have to come to the event because otherwise it's not going to be for sale can i just ask a question on the liquor sales because that one i definitely did not know so why is it that the city can sell a t-shirt and keep the profit and i know we're not keeping a profit right now but we would be allowed to keep a little bit of smart versus alcohol we can't keep anything alcohol is a special per use permit it's a temporary permit and that's just like one of them yeah then you could be set up to be making okay so no profits on alcohol so it's kind of like the quick temporary special event permit yep okay got it so if we make any profits of the chili kickoff it's going to be no donated to the foundation what should we want okay not for five dollars a drink well plus the food i mean but you probably have to compute what the cost of the drink is right like we'll find out what the cost of the bottle is and what the cost of the drink is and whether or not we're actually making a profit plus we got the we're paying for the um police officers too that's gonna you know we're not gonna make a profit on that no no all in all with the event costs we're not gonna profit but you can't like say we had a blowout and we sold a ton of alcohol then maybe but i just it's a lunch on a saturday for two years we're even allowing that right because we're only giving them their two tickets and that's all they can drink oh no then it turns to a cash bar oh i didn't do that okay yeah well i don't know if it came up in a meeting or if it was just a discussion that we had like we're not limiting them like if if you want to have three beers i'm not gonna tell you you can only you know it's you can buy one more beer if you want yeah it's only a two hour event so hopefully people aren't just pounding yeah i mean if you want to do that i think that's an even more bigger liability because i i don't know that we want to do that like i don't love the idea of people at 12 o'clock in the afternoon having more than two drinks and getting on the road like do we want to do that it's a different thing if it's a it's a different thing if it's a nighttime event even then honestly i don't want people getting blasted and getting in their cars like why don't we just limit them to the two drink tickets um well our past events i would say eight out of ten people walked because it was a lot of the people that like you know live around here um i don't know it's up for discussion yeah for discussion i mean i guess the thought was that you're harding people to make sure there's a legal age and then outside of that it's any adult's responsibility to control themselves at any establishment which events just the one just the chili that's the only one and then how much are we going to charge them for a drink we're going to have to come up with all of that five dollars because that's what we're charging them now we're not paying for any of the food people are bringing the chili so we're basically charging them five dollars a drink right because they're getting two tickets for ten dollars correct and so they're getting it for five dollars a drink yes so it's like a domestic beer or you know a glass of house i don't know i just like the idea of having it being very wholesome and family-oriented and stuff and getting you know getting people a little bit drunk isn't necessarily good on that but it's i'm not strongly considering anything that many people would be yeah drinking that much yeah more than the two yeah and you know it's like if you had two drinks versus a 300 pound man that you're telling you can't have a third beer i just you know it's like it's just a way it's different it's like when you go to a company event in the afternoon you get two tickets you have your drinks and you leave and it's kind of the better liability for the the city is not to provide an excessive amount of drinks but i'm not going to push my personal views on drinking on people if not if we do this chili cook-off again next year where would it be most appropriate to have it in the foundation or in this community no it's really it's really more about like what you want here as i said i go to a lot of corporate events and you generally they discourage heavy drinking by giving you drink tickets that's the way that they control how much you drink and i don't think it's really any different here it's like if you give somebody the ability to drink four beers then somebody like us might be pouring the guy beer notice he's drunk and be like hey we can't serve you another beer because you're drunk it gets you into that mess that you don't want to be most events especially outdoor events or festivals and things like that they're not you know they're serving here but then i run by the city um but the other run more by the foundation foundations but i'm saying there's not unless if there's somebody falling over themselves and that's why you know police officers you'll give them a signal like hey this person you know it's the first time i'm ever doing alcohol i'm not again i'm not strongly opposed to it i just stated it's a 12. yeah like a 12-2 event i really think people in the community will keep themselves under control i mean we'll find out right but i i think the majority of it again right 95 of the people who are going to be responsible i think a leading you know way the only other challenge with that is that now we don't know about inventory like how much beer do you need if you limited it to two tickets and you know the person's checking off that i'm getting beer then you know exactly how much beer to buy and exactly how much liquor to buy how much wine to buy because you're going to have the only the only unknown is are they going to drink red or white wine and we could probably manage that and we we've talked about this like where we're only going to open it as we go um because we will return unopened back to the store so i guess within reason whoever's at the bar you know like okay this person's now about this many i mean in a two-hour event and like you know being a community event yeah they're probably not going to get raised in front of all of their neighbors in the past it's been a basically an unsaid byob and people bring coolers and like so it's like they could have had 10 10 cocktails we it's never been like we didn't serve it to them yesterday we didn't city of bellar beach did not serve it to them so we're going to be serving alcohol and if somebody gets in their car and crashes then well that's where you have the insurance right you have insurance it's just again the whole and i think trusting people at a tour event if you're seeing somebody drinking a drink every 15 minutes then i guess we can have a cut out it's kind of a good test case to see it's a small enough event and to see if it really is a problem because i was a strong proponent of at least having alcohol at events because it makes it fun but it's the control on it that you can really limit it but everybody get two drinks and then you're done yeah i think if you see a problem for me you know you can kind of yeah talk to the deputy working in the event or whatever if it's going to possibly be an issue i don't know i just anything can happen anywhere people can show up to events already drunk you know but it's something we'll keep an eye out for yeah and see how it goes for other events and i think it's much better you're right but if it's the foundation it's a little bit you know it's not associative it is associated with the city but in a very different way i just anybody else haven't what do you think patty don't matter to me i i think it's a learning process i think we'll learn from it whether we should just do two tickets next year or the foundation takes it over next year we won't have to worry about it okay so george what do you think i don't know i have mixed feelings about that i don't want if something happens someone has an accident going home they just came from here but that could happen on the two drinks you know that's what i'm saying we're limited to two drinks it's less of a chance of having some problems down the road um if we just open it up and pay for it after tickets i don't know i'm a little concerned about the liability involved well let me ask you because i know the city has had events in the past one was i want to say three years ago where they had crabby bills or something sponsor a beer tent do they limit it to two beers no and then i know um there's a limit there's a cutoff point when someone's visibly impaired but yeah would you i just know the city of bellar beach has had events in the past because the the head of the um but they weren't selling in the past somebody else some company was selling it on on the ground yeah they were selling under there sell it under their license okay that makes sense right but this is something different this is where the city of bellar beach is selling out cool and then there was an event well we used to do the same type of permit in baltimore it celebrated oldsmar and we sold beer we kept selling it i mean if there was an issue we brought it up to the police um but there was no cut off we sold beer as much as they went and they came up and they were having a good time then we had insurance and a permit to sell alcohol yeah and it's already been decided on that it's a beer and wine thing and you've already gotten the license right yes and the insurance yeah we're not going to change it for this year but we haven't i actually just went back i just want to be clear because you did take the notes nicole and we had decided you wrote in the notes that it was beer only it was beer and yeah and we will have beer water and soda and actually that limits liability even more because wine is fifteen percent alcohol twelve to fifteen percent alcohol beer is usually about four to eight it's a much lower risk surely i know you can portion it and i just so if we're gonna we're gonna go back to having wine as well do you think you're ready or whatever yeah if you want to revoke make motion on it we can do that okay i'll make a motion to vote on whether we're going to have just beer and water or did he didn't we talk about having soda diet soda i thought we talked about um cider like hard cider for people who are right now i was just like in that i think because that's what he drinks in place of beer okay so i make a motion to decide whether we will have wine at the event along with the beer along with the beer i second it all in favor of having wine and beer i i'll let the hold on the emotion to serve i'm not sure i understand so if you want to see your mind just be right or just beer the reason i do not want to serve wine to make it clear is twofold one it's harder to manage the inventory because now we're gonna have to buy not just beer but we're gonna have to buy wine we're gonna have to decide whether we're gonna have white wine or red wine and store it and wine doesn't store well you need to keep it at right temperature or else it gets really bad and the second reason is it's higher it's true it's true it's actually true well i know i know but we i think we can manage it right and the second reason is it's higher in alcohol and people are more likely to get drunk especially because when you drink it and it's higher it's just higher than alcohol it's 15 alcohol okay so you're making a motion to serve beer wine and what else so i'm making a motion to vote on whether we serve wine and i guess that's the only motion because like the pop is irrelevant it's just a choice if someone doesn't want to have alcohol water pop um or they could just drink water i mean it's a lot of choices if we buy a lot of pop like take the alcohol out of it it's an inventory thing so i don't know if we need to offer six things for people to drink if you don't want a beer and you don't want a glass of wine then you have water i don't know if people need six choices it's our first i guess from this is the first time that this group has had anything that had alcohol there yes so okay so let's reiterate what the motion is so the motion is to vote whether we're gonna make them make a motion and make ourselves sure what we're serving it'll be the easiest way because it's weird that you're bringing it up if you don't want it so someone should make emotional okay sorry nicole i would like to make a motion to add the wine back in to accommodate people who don't drink beer at all second second all in favor aye aye so it passes three to two make a motion to add wine back in to georgia so i assumed he was a no because we're just adding wine back in so yeah he could have stayed those two abstained and so you can say i mean do you want officially vote well no it was to make a motion so to add wine back in so by not voting it was a no move right instead of making a motion i'm a roberts rule supporter right right yeah thank you robert good ass robertson um okay so anyway so if you just again to reiterate the the point of getting back in this other business is it's for things that we will keep and things like as george mentioned like categories of events or whatever like things that would fall into their bucket and things that would fall into our bucket and then then there's no like oh we're keeping this event we're giving that event away kind of thing i think was your point right yeah what's appropriate is what we should be thinking about yes so we can think about that and talk about it at the next meeting so it's just something to kind of brainstorm on for the next to prepare and it's really sure we can learn from other cities because i know you looked at like the foundation for belair and how what do they break out like what does the bel air foundation do versus what does bellaire parks and recreation do like i just went to this quick i just last week i went to ben eden's fashion show they have a fashion show of the art wearable art that they have every year i don't know if y'all have ever been there and that was parks and rec so that's that cities actually have a parks and rec department it's not just a whole world so that's what but that's what i mean like do we like how do we intelligently decide like what is best for the city by looking at some models of who does it well i know she spent time looking at bellaire foundation so do they have a parks and rec board and what did they retain that they still handle versus what is uh they probably have an advisory board but they also have a parks and recreation department which probably has a special events coordinator they're just larger but we can we can look into it more i'm just curious like you know indian rocks right so indian rocks do they have um does indian rocks have a foundation or they do have a foundation they have a huge recreation department okay so maybe how they split it out because i think it's also you know just hopeful to know how other people do it well i know that the um the park and rec department in bel air like they have a whole kids camp they have a whole baseball team a rec center so it's completely yeah it's like they're paid employees that run like daycare like day camps and stuff like that so that's what their park and rec board focuses on programming and all that kind of like we had it all a better comparison would be like yeah like maybe one of the smaller beach like reddington or public works you know like if we had we think about it my mind thinks always visually you know if we have draw columns what what stays right what makes sense to retain within this group and what makes sense too and i hear the points on you know things that are going to create a large profit you certainly want to go to the foundation um because we're not really here to generate profits yeah no so yeah we can figure that out and talk about it and then get our date set um i don't know what the calendar looks like for next year but hopefully it's not completely in quick get them in quick yeah so i mean we can even put the dates in and then figure it out and does anybody have anything else to add under other business i do so i would like to make a motion to uh i'm very bad at this and i'm still learning that but to vote on i mean i would like to make a motion to vote on whether we limit it to two drinks okay yeah i didn't know where you were going yeah so i want to make because i want a record because i think it's an important enough thing for us to like for important decisions rather than just say well we talked about it like actually have a vote on it what is the motion the motion is to limit um to two tickets two drink tickets for the event rather than have us for sale an open bar making a motion to limit two drink tickets only yes so you only have two homes let's show drinks or beer me are you gonna talk about it two drinks because we did decide to say alcoholic drinks that's what he wants you to say oh two alcoholic drinks cause he's like are you limiting their water and their pop is what he said okay you got it yeah thank you i'm not very good at performing these emotions do i have a second i said all in favor aye so it doesn't pass two to three okay so i always appreciate that when i go to city council that they actually vote on everything and they disagree but i get to know like who i would vote for next time you know based on their how they vote i think it's an important thing to to commemorate that we didn't just talk about it we actually had vote on it that's good okay does anybody oh i have one more thing okay so um for other business so attendance policy i'm gonna ask just for the consideration of everyone in the room and because it's disruptive if you're going to be more than 15 minutes late or if you have to leave early to please excuse yourself from the meeting um because if you're leaving early over and over it's disruptive and you know if you're coming in late i would just appreciate it just because then it's then you hear everything that we're talking about and um it's just a better flow to the meeting so i don't know if i need to make a motion on that kyle said it's kind of my gig because it's my meeting so i don't think that it's emotion yeah so you're in charge just yeah and i don't mind how long the meeting is supposed to be because i i think i'm not sure if other people work but i work um i think you work in a call listen we're all busy and our meetings are usually about two hours long but if you're gonna talk not you but if any i don't i can't control tangents so like if someone likes has like a 20-minute dissertation on something and it makes the meeting last long i'm not going to skip the bottom half of the agenda because someone really wanted to talk about something and i'm not going to cut anybody off either so typically we're like an hour and a half to two hours but i can't say that i think that's fine what you just said is fine to bank on it being about two hours bank on it being about two hours starting to try to clear my account but i don't want to cut anybody off because like people have good ideas people have things that they want to talk about and say or express so i i just i think it's good to not limit the discussions i can i can do a three minute limit or you know what i mean like so the meeting stays on a specific time agenda but in the two years we've been doing this we've never had an issue at all so and we're all busy and we all have things to do and all of our time is important but i can't control what you know like if we have citizens come in and we have 45 minutes minutes of citizens comments i can't control that so i would say around one time around two hours yeah is pretty bankable but like you know we this kind of thing is brand new to us the alcohol and the chili cook-off is brand new to us so i would just say when you look at the agenda when patty sends it out as you attend more and more meetings you kind of know what's going to be more of discussion groups like things that we need to talk about in more detail if it's just a quick update on boom boom boom boom boom then we might be out of here in an hour we've had meetings that have lasted that long so i would say on average two hours but there are our meetings have been the longest you know in the last couple of times and they've been since we started so i mean it's just more people more people talk that's all it is so if we had a full board like we had the two alternates here and you know we had lloyd and a few more people then it's it's gonna be longer i just can't control that but i i'll do the best that i can well again he has some good ideas though and i like that he's a council member and that like you know what i mean so george and i um the previous four i think some of those went over three a park board [Music] meetings so anyway with that being said um does anybody have anything else no okay so then for our next meeting um okay so i threw out october tuesday october 11th or thursday october 13th at two o'clock our meetings are always at two o'clock but i don't know if she wrote that yes um so i don't know if you want to check your calendars now if you want to just email paddy any day nothing works for yourself [Music] all right so tuesday the 11th okay got it down and then make a motion on that while she was made every second okay all in favor okay so the next meeting is october tuesday october 11th at two o'clock and then um just a reminder because we already voted on this is the setup for the um halloween event is friday october 28th it's on your meeting notes at one o'clock here we meet in this room and then we just kind of pull everything out kyle's in the process of pulling out the halloween decorations from last year to see what we were able to salvage and not have to repurchase so hopefully we don't have to really buy anything we're going to have to buy new numbers because could you say again what because i haven't set up it was three o'clock for that and it's four to six it's the actual event three three get there an hour early that day yeah three o'clock on sunday she didn't put it on here but three o'clock or i didn't i guess um october 30th 3 p.m and then the event's 4-6 [Music] but that would be a i mean obviously we're all here on that friday and i'll reiterate it again that we need to be here at three o'clock on sunday the weather's good if the weather is good yes yeah she'll send out an era reminder of all three with the agenda so they'll be on there and like they always are okay i second that all in favor aye thank you everybody"
