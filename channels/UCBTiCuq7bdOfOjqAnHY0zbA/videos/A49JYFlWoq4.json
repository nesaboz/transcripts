    "transcript": "hello it is now 6 p.m and uh this is the june 1st special council meeting and uh let's uh let's bring it to order uh please rise and join me in the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all right quick i want to do a sound check for vice mayor gunn can you hear me i have you loud and clear how am i wow this is incredible this is going to be our best remote meeting ever nice job everyone great job all right um patty will you please call the role here here and council members thank you patty we only have uh one item on the agenda and that's all we can have on a special council meeting today we're here to accept or reject the 12th and 13th street drainage modification bid number 22-01 this meeting was called because the bid expires on june the 4th and the next regular meeting is on june the 6th before we continue may i have a motion motion by frank banker do i have a second second second by leslie notaro all right mr banker do you have before um this is an ongoing problem on 12th and 13th 13th street unfortunately i wasn't here at the last work session i apologize so i didn't hear a lot from what the engineer was saying but um some of these costs i do have a problem with um from the first bid to the second and i also have a problem with if needed line items um who's going to like check these if needed light items do we have an independent inspector as you're talking about eighty thousand dollars yeah the the engineer that's part of his requirement as part of the okay um and the only the the big thing i see here is the mobilization it went up 25 000 it didn't go up that was the low bidders mobilization cost okay so i'm i'm getting two different yeah i thought this was i thought this was the increased charges from no no no no you what you've got there is uh the uh first thing is from uh excuse me from uh knr okay and that's their bid with their total base bid and then the second one is uh from the next bidder which was matm mtm and their gross bid was 821 000. so you've got both bid tabulations from both of them because i have one at 652 and one at 747 right those are the base bids and then the other options are the contingency that's the 10 contingency for uh that we typically put in every bit if there's an old bridge or something and and why while you're interjecting here what i heard at the work session there's two compressions in that pipe right now on that right okay so we ever get a cost to remove the compressions only no we did not we got what the engineer told us and he said it could any range from forty to sixty thousand dollars depending in the and my last question is when would they start this project if if they would start it uh relatively quickly i mean we'd give them a notice to proceed and they have x amount of days to complete it that's in the bid document and my final question would be is that gonna we just started uh the hurricane season um ripping up that road ripping up that pipe is that gonna have what are they doing i guess what the question is what will we be doing to prepare drainage as a removing pipe because lots of times you remove it from one side of the street the other side right um i just don't want to see i hate to see these projects start in june rather than starting right january right well i i mean we've done several of the projects some of them have been in the summer some of them haven't we've just adjusted and they've taken care of the drainage so okay we haven't had an issue with some backup typically what they do is they excavate and replace the pipe at a time and just keep going is it anyone else nope mr gun i think i expressed my opinions at the work session i i'm kind of uncomfortable with this huge price increase on this thing i've read through the stormwater study i pulled it up and took a look at it and it seems to me a lot of it is based on simulations and computer analysis of elevations and that sort of thing i i'm stuck on the fact that we're doing nothing to fix the constraint we're widening pipes within the street but the outfalls are the constraints so we can we can put in larger pipes in the street but we're still trying to eject the water through the outfalls through basically a straw and i have a concern about that i i think there are some things that must be addressed right now and if you take a look at some of the recommendations in the report it talks about that the uh the uh the actual drainage grates as the city managers talked about it there are some uh depressions in the ground that are obvious problems that need to be fixed right now but overall i i think we may need to go back and take a a really good look at this thing and uh maybe it'd be a little more surgically precise and what issues we want to fix rather than just the recommendation was just to fix all these things not necessarily based on data that there's a problem right there but just to overall we're going to increase the size of this pipe while we still have these constraints so i'm kind of tossed on this and i'm inclined to fix some of the obvious things that we can fix and we know our successful inputs but so far it's just a wholesale goal with this contract that kind of opposed that thank you thank you um mr reeves i look this plan over and uh correct me if i'm wrong but it looks like one of the pipes going to the intercoastal is would be new is that correct the one on uh 12th street no it wouldn't be it's not we don't have any uh easement or access to put that out either one of them no okay for some reason whenever i was looking at it it appeared that one pipe was larger than the other we did uh approach the county about dumping into their stormwater pond but they denied us to do that all right and then the uh the pipe joining the two that one would be enlarged yes okay all right um how much did we invest on this study the study i wasn't able to find that because that was prior to my time and unfortunately the the accountant wasn't here today that they could go back and do some more research for it because she's sick but uh we did spend 30 plus thousand on the design already and i'm guessing uh i'm just giving you a guess number but it was probably in the 30 000 range for the study okay that's all i have for now any other council members have a question you brought up open ahead that's right so i think a good assumption would be if we asked the current engineering firm to redesign based on new information that we would ask the city to take a look at for example if we only wanted to repair the pipes that were currently failing at the junctions and not replace any of the current pipes that are out there because my take on it was as we discussed in the workshop step one is to completely video all the pipes all the reinforced concrete pipes in my opinion just to make sure that they are in need of replacement i've seen mixed studies out there analysis the army corps of engineers says that a lot of the reinforced concrete pipes will last up to 125 years to 150 years ours are currently 70 years so we do have a failure or two there but it's not because the pipe failed it's because the joint failed and that's a construction issue when they were joining the pipes together whoever did that work i would have to guess um maybe didn't do it 100 correctly then that area failed then the water comes in and erodes the base underneath it that sinks the road sinks and therefore lies the problem so if we if we prob not probably we would definitely have to fix that pipe um but the other pipes if they look sound and solid my recommendation would be at this time based on data that's out there i don't think we would necessarily have to replace all of those current pipes which would save a considerable amount of money so that's why i'm concerned about moving forward with the contract at this point did you say moving forward with a contract i'm concerned about doing it so i'm not in favor of moving forward mike sable no i i definitely agree with all that i would really like to go back and uh perhaps look at a re-scope of the project that we really do target what has to be done uh vice a kind of a comprehensive bid as it was proposed anyone else leslie i am in favor of going forward with it now we've still got we've had the flooding for a long time we need to fix it we've you know hired capable engineers to do it we've got these bids from um good engineering firms and it's not going to get any cheaper and it's going to keep flooding if we don't address it and sooner rather than later thank you anyone else just what do you recommend wayne well i we've expended funds already on this project uh what i would recommend is the the 200 000 overage we've got the american rescue money that's not really coming out of our budget it's it's a gift i'll say from the government and we plan to use it for storm water i think the people on the street expect the project to be done now if you want to change the scope for the next street down the road i i would agree with that but at this point it was designed we paid money for the design and it was a recommendation of the stormwater study that was done several years ago i'll admit that but if you want to change the scope long term then i would say do this project and go on and if you want to adjust the future projects then start that process at that point i agree with you i i believe that uh the residents on 12th and 13th are expecting something they've been waiting a long time and uh in my opinion it's time to move forward on this project one of the things that i committed to was doing everything i could for storm drainage and uh um is there a better way they may there may very well be however i'm worried about um paralysis through analysis where we never move on this project and we have some very angry residents uh by the time by the time we're finished having this discussion so right now i am uh leaning towards moving forward on this project but i would i would be very interested in hearing from the citizens yes mr hansik john hanson 22nd street mr mayor members of the council um i hope i get this done in three minutes but the bottom line is this i cannot find the words to convince you or urge you to approve this contract as it is now 12th and 13th street completing it would probably finish half of the upgrades and replacement of the storm system in the city that we're responsible for okay the yesterday i received from the city clerk the report was commissioned in 2016. i took the time to read it it said that back then six years ago the system was too small and obsolete we've also heard that sleeving is a band-aid eventually you're going to have to replace the pipe i understand what you're saying about fixing issues but as the city manager just indicated you've got this 800 plus thousand dollar gift from the american rescue plan the advisory committee recommended that all of it go towards stormwater and everything that i've heard so far is go forward with this project as it is now if you want to readjust reevaluate um how much you do in the out years that's okay but you're you're on the verge of and here's another thing to think about material and labor is not going to get cheaper and i want to give you a quick example i'm running for a national office in a fraternal organization i'm traveling the country i've been on the internet to buy airline tickets for my travels so i get my outbound flight and my return flight and i scrolled down to pay for it and by the time i hit checkout pay price is up anywhere from 50 to 75 dollars i just filled up my truck it's 25 cents more than it was yesterday things are not getting cheaper so again i urge you to approve this contract and move forward with it if you want to adjust things downstream for the remaining streets so be it thank you thank you any other citizens no let's go back to the council i think city manager recommends it our mayor is recommending it i know there's a couple people on council that has questions but i think we should do it yes sir the problem is i specifically uh contacted the engineering firm responsible for this project and i had a couple questions for them the first one was if we go ahead and do this work will we see a difference in the current flooding scenarios that we're seeing today and the answer was no for example if we have a high tide and a large rain event the work that's going to be done is not going to help prevent the water that we're currently seeing forming in the streets on 12th and 13th street so that's my biggest concern i know there were comments made about you know the citizens who live on 12th and 13th street might be upset if we don't do this and we see problems i think they're going to be more upset when they find out we spent 750 000 and the same problems that they've seen previously they will see today that is a problem that's why i want to review it and determine exactly what needs to be done so that we don't spend any more money than we have to and go ahead and take care of what needs to be taken care of because really the only problem could potentially be is if the reinforced concrete pipe that's currently installed is failing and then we have major problems from that but until we can determine that by videoing videoing all of those pipes that are currently there the city has already done some pretty cool things by putting the check valves on the end of the outfall pipes which has prevented i talked to citizens on those streets and it was kind of interesting because their take on it was hey uh mr roberts that's great you guys already took care of of changing out the pipes i said well actually we haven't yet that's what we're getting ready to do potentially but they had seen improvements with the check valve because what that did was when the high tide came up and some of the citizens have experienced water back flowing from the intercoastal up through those outfall pipes onto the street that pretty much has gone away because of what the city currently did which is wonderful but but spending this amount of money and not actually causing a difference that's a problem i think of use of our funds other council members vice mayor gunn i agree with lloyd i think moving forward on this thing is smart but i think we need to rescue the project and address those issues that we know will provide positive results while we investigate the others such as scoping the the lines and the pipes we have never objectively evaluated the results we got from the previous projects we have a lot of anecdotal uh analysis floating around yet it's better you know it's worse some people are complaining well you spent a lot of tax money and we haven't seen any changes it's somewhere in between but the bottom line is we have never objectively evaluated the results from what we we worked on before uh yeah we spent money on a report that's sunk cost of don't go chasing money you've already spent with an improper decision that's sunk cost and sometimes that can be a bad management decision so far spending rescue money i agree let's spend rescue the rescue money on storm water but let's do it smartly let's not just buy cat food because the price is right right now and the price of cat food is going to go up even though you don't own a cat so my point is i agree with spending rescue money on stormwater but let's do it smart let's move forward but let's rescue the project and get those things we're going to get the biggest bang out of and that we know will yield positive results while we figure out a way to objectively evaluate whether or not we get better with these projects we haven't we haven't attained that yet that's it thank you thank you uh mr reeves i have another question uh this are the streets that they're recessing in places is that correct yes this is one of our one of our not great streets okay and this is thinking is that from the pipe sinking yes in part of it it's probably because there's a seal break or whatever but until you excavate that if i went out and said to uh i'll just say to a contractor i need you to excavate this road and make a repair he could say yeah i'll excavate it but it could be forty sixty thousand dollars and once it gets in there because he doesn't really know we can you know we've got some camera scoping of the pipes the majority of us the outfall stuff uh and you know they're the cameras are it's some of it's pretty rough shape internally uh even the concrete company says 70 to 100 years i've heard the story about you know like lloyd said it's it's 70 to 100 years well we're at 70 plus years on these pipes already so they're at their what i want to call it the end of their useful life you know you're two-thirds of the way gone if you use a hundred you know you're already two-thirds of the way gone and we're not trying to prevent all flooding what we're trying to do is gain some capacity we stopped the backflow of coming into the streets from high tide and that's what the goal was we live on an island it was never to prevent all the flooding but if you go through the projects first through uh seventh and eighth it has improved periodically from from prior before we had the backflow and new drainage system and we had some storage capacity and we put ourselves onto in some cases where there's a park we could build a bigger outfall but unfortunately when you get to the to the residential areas where there's no park like here 12th and 13th there's no way to change that capacity unless you want to go dig up the yards between the houses which probably could cost well over a quarter million dollars just for those two pipes because you could damage the homes that are next to them and they're very narrow you know the space so uh like i said my my suggestion is we've expended the money and uh we've got to design if the council decides they don't want to do it that's the council's decision but the fact of the matter is it'll be probably you're going to have to redesign the project we're going to have to go back to the engineering firm and say hey we want to do something different it's going to cost you x amount of dollars we'll do some more hammering i'm i'm sure but in the end result is it going to save any money uh you know if you had to just dig up the one pipe that the the big cost here is the 18 inch pipe uh because we've got a thousand feet of it but if you just had to dig up that one pipe and it cost you forty thousand dollars you've already spent the forty you could replace the pipe with you know and and you didn't replace anything uh i i mean we have pretty good videos of the outfalls over there uh and you know that we've had them ground the internal you know clean the oysters and stuff out so like i said my suggestion if you want to change to the future that's i wouldn't have any problem with that but i think you've already expended a good amount of time in in the engineer uh did tell me you know that yeah there is a range of 70 to 100 years but you've started the last 30 years of it so um what happens if the pipe fails between the homes the only thing you could do with that you'd have to slip line it that's why we try to keep them as clean as possible get the oysters out of them and that's why we do that but we with those pipes we don't have the problem of sinking streets and uh constant puddling where oh we've had a few places uh kyle donato right yeah we've had a few places where we've had to go in because the pipes are between the houses where we've had a little bit of failure but predominantly the failures in the streets and that's probably because of the traffic because the traffic and the big trucks going up and down street things of that nature uh we've slip lined those pipes uh and they're fine but slip lining is expensive if you just want to slip line these pipes you're talking double the price how far from the city pipe to the residential pipe were we talking about to the discharge how many feet uh i'd have to look at the plan but the discharge that the one off of 12th street the discharges is significant because it's between those two big houses and there's a lot of property there the one on 13th street is much shorter more than 100 feet oh yeah yeah have we looked in the directional boring um well that's what you do slip line you wouldn't directional bore it well you'd put a whole new pipe in if you did that if we're going to i was listening to the vice mayor he's talking about having the ability to objectively evaluate and my big fear right now i mean i've been reviewing this is we may be in uh kind of an overall just paralysis by analysis is if we go ahead with this project do we have enough points data points that we can objectively evaluate how this performed going forward how how all of the projects perform how this specific project if we approve it and it goes forward upon accomplishing the project do we have enough data points to say yes we were successful in doing the following on this street well i think you would the the the really evaluation would have to come from the water that's drained and how fast it gets out uh and uh you know the type of storm it was as an example okay because going going the future it's like we heard the term objectively evaluate but we don't even have that criteria i'm just trying to get a set of criteria like say if we go forward would i would like to use the criteria now well we feature projects an engineering firm to develop something that that the council would feel comfortable with but what i'm mainly saying is you want to evaluate the pipes going north uh all of you saw the stormwater plan i believe it's page 70 something vice mayor and i did talk about it but in the stormwater plan uh 12th and 13th street have a high degree of water in the modeling okay there's another area that we had a pretty good size degree of modeling down at hibiscus in belle isle which prevented people from getting out of the street so we fixed that doing the same thing we're doing here uh you know if you spoke to the residents on most of the south streets with the check valves and the rainfall for the most part it gets out we have a you know where mr banker lives i lived right next door to him for 23 years so the water is definitely lower than it was 20 years ago but i did i would debate you on that but because you moved out right after the project was done oh it was donna yeah i don't know but anyway uh it you know it's it's just gonna be if there's some more analysis that we need to do then data points that the console wants us to ask for then you know we can talk to the engineer about that and figure out some way to analyze it but i do know that residents on the street over there and they've even told council member roberts that it's better than it was and uh the rainfall what three weeks ago when it came down i did go to that street and there wasn't much on it you know but they have a higher check valve that's right then 7th and 8th street there right yeah which makes a whole big difference yeah and that's part of the issue too any other council members yes mr roberts and mr reeves when you were talking about uh when i just glanced at this project not glanced when i studied this project it looks like to me currently there's only one pipe that definitely needs to be replaced that's the one kind of at the corner of the 13th right there where that settlement area is where there's a joint problem so effectively if we only did that pipe right there from corner to corner i don't know that's about 20 feet and it's about a hundred and ten dollars a linear foot so you're talking about three thousand dollars plus some of the base work to be done there so you i heard you say something about forty thousand so well that's the estimate i asked the engineer about if if you're excavating to get it done let's say tomorrow it fails right we'd we'd have to go get somebody to excavate immediately well it's not going to be three or four thousand dollars no but that takes into account mobilization all those other fees that the city is going to have to incorporate right so if we modified this particular plan and and basically said we're not doing the rest of the other pipes because we think after videoing those pipes they're in good condition and will last significantly longer then we're only uh you know it's we're basically reducing it by just in the pipe itself about a hundred and seventy thousand dollars so that that's pretty significant from from our revenue i believe if we don't have to do it at this time now one of the issues the engineer had was well if we have to go back in let's say in five years then the asphalt work that we did now we're going to be tearing that up but he says basically that's about a 15-year redo anyway so if the pipe lasts another 15 years then we would get it on the next go around and who knows what i mean i wish i had a magic ball it's going to tell me what the prices of things are going to be i know everybody says it's going to go up up up we all saw wood for example when the covet craziness hit and the price of plywood went up to here and now it's not there anymore it actually came down so prices of some things did go down we don't know for sure what's going to happen but again my whole fear at this point is we don't maybe have to do it at this point we don't know until we take a video of the pipes to see what the condition is and if it shows that they're in pretty good condition then i would definitely recommend that we don't do it at this time we just go ahead and do that one type that's required to be repaired plus of course all the other work that's going to help 12th and 13th street the uh the gutters and the and the milling and the new asphalt that's going to go down but the only place we would remove and replace pipe would be at that one location where we know there's a problem mr reeds are there other locations where the street is recessed uh beyond the uh the particular spot he's talking about uh i i know there are but i can't say to you specifically where on 12th and 13th yes yeah i've driven 12th and 13th multiple times to try to find another one because the engineer did mention to me he thought there were two yeah i could not find a second one the only one i found was right there at that corner of 13th uh which connects over to the outfall pipe right right there but i didn't see another one let me ask kyle kyle i'm sorry could you say it one more time i feel like we had something sticking on the edge of the roadway some kind of washout that we repaired it's been it's been holding up but i mean it wasn't the pipe itself wasn't repaired it was more thank you very much any other council members and then i'd like to take it for a vote mr god uh you know i'm looking at section six of that study and it it talks about outdated design outdated and undersized stormwater system you know if you i think if you read through there there's there's there's no real hard data about a failing infrastructure system i mean it's not like pipes are collapsing we know there are some problem areas but it's not like you have collapsing pipes and it's an infrastructure problem it's an outdated design it's undersized and it talks about you have some restrictions in the water flow so i think uh chasing this we've kind of gotten off on a tangent here we've got to replace the system because it's at the end of its useful life well i guess that hey you know i'm i'm from kansas you got to show me it's failing i haven't seen any of that in all of the reports based on simulation nobody's ever really taken a hard look at the actual infrastructure itself it talks about other things you know it talks about the flow capacities and we know there are constraints in the outfalls it talks about making sure you're you're doing periodic maintenance on these things and it also talks about there are lack of storm water infrastructure in some areas so once again i'm i'm not convinced we just need to do a wholesale replacement of piping and that sort of thing i at this point until we can do a good evaluation of what is the present situation what's the end condition right did we get better on some of these other ones i i'm not convinced and i think right now i would like to move forward but i would like to rescue the project and just pick out those things we absolutely know we get positive results about them that's it thank you thank you very much uh if there are no other comments uh yes no then i would like to go ahead and take this to a vote um because this is a large amount of money and it's a very important project uh let's do a roll call vote okay so this is to authorize the city manager to award the 12th and 13th street drainage modification project bid b22-01 to i hope i get this right kaminga and root votes incorporated in the amount of 717 349.60 and approve a budget increase in the stormwater fund capital outlay and capital projects fund in an amount not to exceed 200 000 to complete the project a yes vote will be to accept the bid and budget increase a no vote will be to reject the bid and the budget increase patty please call the roll council members able yes council member roberts no councilmember notara yes councilmember banker yes vice mayor gunn nay mayor goddess yes uh so the uh the yeses have it have four to two and uh city manager reeves you are authorized to move forward with this project thank you for attending and do i have a motion to adjourn who should know adjourn question made by frank banker do i have a second second all in favor aye any opposed goodnight everyone"
