stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all [Music] Pledge of Allegiance the United States every time this happened remember Dr Bob The Voice [Music] it's a YouTube live hey would you please call council member Frank Banker council member Belinda Livingstone council member Leslie Notaro councilmember Lloyd Roberts vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis city manager Kyle riesler here City attorney Randy Mora present and council member Mike Fable was unable to attend thank you Peggy and we'll just move right on to item number one which is discussion of the citizens advisory committee's recommendation for the stormwater project bond issue which is placed on the agenda by city manager amen so I'm happy to be bringing this to the meeting United citizens advisory committee has been working on it for months now um primarily the chairs and it will have their financial consultants have been putting numbers together and working with the small Banks and Chris Road who kind of organized the financials of the loan that we're going to talk about tonight I'm going to start off by um talking about this first page this is a spreadsheet unfolding the only you're able to see the numbers on the narrative making big enough um and if you go to start on the left the projects you'll see this is the uh the next five years of well I should say in two of the years we're on the second year here but it's the five strong stormwater projects that are remaining the master plan it talks about the uh the project what streets it's on since the year that it responded so right now we're finding out to 17th and 18 19 20th and 9th that leaves the remaining starting in the next one year will be 22nd 23rd the following uh Morgan and 25th and then uh fiscal year 25 26 or 814 through 16. um it breaks down as you can see the it has the BMP it has the uh 2022 estimated cost of the project so the products have gone up with the estimated cost because uh we found out with the 12th and 13th Street project that it came out a little higher than estimated so there's uh you can see notes all over on the right uh assumptions notes and it talks about increase budget by 30 percent because we are 22 23. so all these numbers over here they have 2022 estimated costs that is a multiplier 1.3 times the last estimated cost which was done in 2019. so if you follow the budgeted for BNP again if you get up here this year because of the Year 2223 we're budgeted you know for the 17th 18th 1920s and 9th Street project we have money that's on a sales plan that was projected for the next three projects but we don't have it on the budget yet the resurfacing portion of the project so bmd is the actual stormwater you know dating up changing inlets replacing pipe um from our Mass family the engineer recommended the resurfacing portion the next one over is the coinciding streets to be to be resurfaced while the Project's taking place so it lists um per project the streets in the area what you're trying to do is our street index you'll see just below that or is this condition under one scale and then ranked uh you know like total score of 100 the horses that we're at 0 to 20. and I tried the color code those without having the index in front of us the street listing with how the condition is actually in so you'll see that a lot of these streets that coincide with the projects are you know covered from red to Yellow which is you know pretty much the more streets that are remaining in the city all these projects the streets that are Incorporated with them will take us to resurfacing all the streets on the index that are um up to like the yellow condition the next one um onion there's a green condition which is fairly new it's in good shape for a scale so there were services session is um calculator now I ran it through a calculator that has been very accurate which I created about three years ago and um it's been holding true to the to the estimated cost of what the researching would cost but as part of the project so what I did is I calculated how the streets that are remaining to be resurfaced and did an estimate resurfacing cost for each one of those project years and then same thing for curbs when we were surface restraints we also change out the valley curve and I ran the numbers on estimations for the curve for those projects I bring this all the way over to the total budget which kind of lays out everything with the uh the accumulated Reserves in the total project so um total project shortfall and that's basically because um even now when like when we look at like 17th 18th 19th 20th and 9th Street um the resurfacing cost of the project we actually do not do not have a total budget for so some of these are even falling short and you'll also notice that the 17th and 18th project that was saved for 336 before we increased the estimated Budget on each other projects so we fall a little bit short there as well so what we did is we ran all these numbers so this is the this is the total cost which I broke down on the bottom here you'll see you know star water Fortune the resurfacing portion the curb portion and that gives you the total project cost minus what's already accumulated in the budget so it shows our current deficit the total products is about 2.8 million and um on the bottom area of the table laid it out per fun so um some other projects and the valley curve is part of the stormwater fund the screen resource city is actually part of the capital project fund just to show the fun breakdown well it's important to know here is that we still have the article money which was injected into the stormwater fund but um it was brought up earlier I want to make clear that the uh when we talked about doing the underground project we talked about you know that money could make up that deficit that we had in the underground project so if that's how how we applied it um I just want to make a note that I said the reserves to the cap um reserves the capital project fund for underground project will show in the CPI projections and that's that's the next couple pages that have us put together but just the money is in the stormwater fund but just to be clear um if we're saying that money is going through the main year what was left on the Underground project then um that 802 000 will be transferred from the uh from reserves to cover that part of the cost either way that money will be spent um and in this case it'll be technically spent and reimburse the storm water but the budget all balances what I'm trying to say so just want to make that clear um and then if you go to the next couple of pages this is the projections that Hazard ran for us and she kind of just worked out on what year did the table which shows the amounts of stormwater funds versus the capital project fund of our proposed loan that we're looking to acquire and then this is probably the furthest we've come um governor in the most recent years of laying out a projection of where where we're going on and the general fund product projection if you look at the top it shows us the pretty much the reserves were sitting that's sitting there outside of the budget then we have accumulated and we broke it down into some separate buckets to show you have the unassigned which is money that is just you know we've accumulated it it's in account it's collecting interest but it is not assigned into anything in the budget so it's completely um outside of the budget the assigned capital projects we wanted to show what her the last budget what we allocated for future Capital products and that's what that represents um a sign for transfers that is you know what would have to transfer into another fund that current year and then the 20 Charter requirement that we just wanted to illustrate the number per Charter that is uh 20 of the operating expenses of the city and then through these projections you'll also see that we've kept the hurricane preparedness per resolution okay a million dollars so that it's actually that's not included in the unassigned reserves that is that is separate in these projections um and then you'll see this is a general fund it's important to note that due to the underground new project you'll see our if you look at this current year it came up quite a bit and we're at about four million dollars we've jumped we fall back down a little bit because the injection into the undergrounding project but then you'll see after that our unassigned funds continue to grow and a lot of this was done in a very conservative manner where [Music] um the only predicted one percent growth in revenues you can kind of see these are very small the percentages of what she projected and the expenses she did about three percent across the board except for a personality which is a five percent but using these projections you can see that we're pretty financially healthy as a city I'm gonna share share a person not see anything go into the low numbers a little bit great thanks Kyle and uh just to back up this all started when we were tasked back in October to see if we could do something with the million dollar hurricane Reserve uh just to let you know when we talk to the banks the banks wanted a one and a half percent fee uh to put a 500 000 line together at one and a half percent annual renewal fee if illegal was about 12 Grand and so it just it didn't make sense to touch that cash it's as part of the spirit was and we take that maybe a half a million dollars of that cash and it accelerates something you store a lot of projects so we can talk about the bank I asked where the weights at today this is the back of October they're like 40 and so we started working on this idea and uh today what I'll present to you is we've had two proposals from uh one from Valley Bank and one from South State so South state is the the last two Bond issues for the city the one from the Bellevue Estates undergrounding and the one for the store of water from object I'll uh I've retired for Valley so uh Valley did not happen in this whole division when I worked there but they do now and so just so I give you that disclosure I don't work for them I don't get paid by then but uh I honestly think the uh Stephanie is a better deal as jewelry so there's analysis that I prepared it's called Cindy Beller boots you have to bottom comparison that you should have and so these are a 10-year facility uh South state is at 4.36 valleys of 445 percent they both have uh no prepay as long as it's paid off through cash flow uh South state would have a one percent pre-bedroom penalty this is going to be an important to me because of the existing prepayment penalty on this particular facility the 2006 wild issue uh we did look at potentially the role the battle so just slowed in and just consolidate everything but Chris Rose our law Council noted that we would lose the tax frame uh status if we refinance already Finance tax-free loan so that's why we've had three years left of Payless that is detailed if the budget that Heather did and uh so this is just strictly for the storm water in the Curbing and the roads resurfacing legal fees was a pretty big difference uh sales state was the 3000 versus 7 500. an anti-dilution test that is basically a debt service coverage ratio and we have that on the existing truth of 4.25 times and if you if you want to skip to the almost the back of this presentation there is that anti-pollution test that was prepared by Chris row we we test out it four times 4.03 per second so what does that mean that means uh it so what we are pledging is our not at the lower Revenue it's not that performance but not at the lower Revenue so we generated last year almost one of the great million and so when you take our 445 000 in that service that's four times so we're very strong to give us a perspective at the interest rates we're talking the city could borrow 11.5 billion still be here to buy it just a good use of scope uh what was interesting is the banks were throwing out of the deposit requirements yeah I failed to change uh my sheep the deposit required by South state was officially five hundred thousand dollars after this this is advisory Council got together the sort of sheet that you have I requested that to lower to 250 000 which they agreed to do the good news is a positive area Channel we could take a hurricane funds or just any kind of money uh that instantly Reserves at Market therefore there's no breaks you can buy the closest branches to eat and so for a day-to-day operating it doesn't make any sense but if you you'll see the deposit rates that they're paying uh it's the opposite of the deposit rates versus the low rates so sell States at 408 and when they pay is effective at floods so if like the bed funds today is 4.58 5 is 50 basis points so 408 is what they pay that way is paying Target pet buds which is 475 minus 50. so battery's paying for a quarter and just you know watch your boil out Banks this last week in the State of Florida banks are required to collateralize these uh deposits of what floods are required to be collateralized so they're super safe it doesn't matter to the bank and both of these banks are very conservative so so an interesting point is would you put a little bit of a sales thing to move the deposit relationship from truesta Valley it it basically If the Fed raises rates I have a point this week we're going to be earning an interest on our deposits which are almost amount of times what we're borrowing equal the interest rate to what we're made additional perspective any other cost of the bond so the interest expense uh if you ran into the journey into the legal fees and then the uh the final Bond about so what good objective was the 2 billion 73 354 and we have Auto Council fees the importance issuing a bond is that we are required diversity uh attorney for the historically provide a legal opinion and so uh that legal opinion fee is what was uh calculated in the original contract that we have at the bank legal piece so he is a total in your body needed to flood the closings billion 107 179 or 2 billion what was I said he died but really the difference is the bank's legal fees is that what does this do for the city of Valor Beach first of all the residents uh benefit of getting their school larger water projects accelerated you may would anticipated at least a 250 000 of its savings on the mobilization fees we estimate there'll be about a half a billion dollars of mobilization fees and we're doing these enabled chunks so that 250 uh would be a pretty dramatic savings uh provided with the interest of the cash reserves to be equal or higher with the bondage for six minutes uh you making interest expense you're negligible if any and then also you know Heather did a great job with the projections if you look out where the general flood will be back to over six billion dollars in the uh 25-26 and 2627 fiscal years you know I read some math that if we go ahead and repay a billion dollars and it just kept being paid payments going this loan would be paid off in five and a half years with a total insurance expense of 342 000 623. and what we didn't calculate in here is the savings of materials of Labor like getting it all done today versus spreading it out over the next three to four years so it puts more uh you guys have copies of the actual term sheets uh adversation schedule so I'll be open to questions yes yeah I think that was great I think they'll they'll be an added benefit as well my guess would be that because this is a larger project and I know we can't really necessarily put a number to that but we'll probably have larger firms bid on these projects that will probably bid better pricing more competition I think that's going to be in addition but I realize we can't really put a number to that but I think we're going to see that benefit as well others are we going to be doing uh multiple streets at one time mobilization Center so we still figure this project is going to take place in about 120 days it may be 150 for based on the size but we still imagine that they're going to work from one section to the next so be over multiple excuses when they do the paving and things they're going to want to bring them into it all at once how much money did we get for I need for vanilla for underground underground and I don't know it's like 902 but I've already was like 900 2 000 two years so a billion eight million no yeah that's remaining but we had I'd have the questions and we had money still coming too um so with the budget that got it prepared once it's all said and done about three years ago we get the file [Applause] so this current budget on the total we got for penny four is a four million 123. yeah so this um prior year funding up to the um before this budget was 1.3 million we got another 930 930 000 this year and then we have over 930 000 units here in the following year what am I missing here if we would have took 2 million of that and put it into our infrastructure however we need a bond yes well it that's what that's the way we allocated but not the way the blueprint for the uh Pennies from Pinellas County for Pinellas County emphasized stormwater projects that's the first thing they really pushed for this Council before I satellite started using that money for under it so I think part of it is just to be clear as as a good portion of that I'm not going to say half of it but probably 40 comes from Miller's stores a Porsche yes total and we're having a deficit and what really really scares me is our deficit right now is 2.8 and there's big talk that we're going to use the smart money which is 802 thousand dollars pull that out so now we're going to be at a 3.6 million or 3.7 million up our deficit no we didn't say we're pulling that out I don't think well that's been talking [Music] I objected to this undergrounding I think stormwater projects are Central to the city that's right in our strategic plan it's one of our goals and to put the city knock which I'm going to vote for because it needs to be done but this is how big government starts taking over like you just said where it can go with 11 million dollars that are still going to be any good I just hope we had a little bit of foresight in the future when we have money given to us we use it for what it's supposed to be used now correct me if I'm wrong but the there is just a small portion of the pennies for Pinellas money that would allocated specifically for both OverWatch is that right so like I said last year we got 170 000 Revenue but if you look at the penny Ford project reimbursement program each year we're getting 930 000. it's specifically has some purification that's how the agreement was signed which would have came through this project I mean it was something that was agreed to years ago this is not something any of us had anything and this is every Community yeah anyone in front Boulevard basically um so just I have a question because I can't quite put my finger on it what are we collecting in the stormwater fee what's the revenues of that apparently it's like at least 175. yes and um that was from what I would call this yeah 175. the uh you know the starting assessment we wanted to look at is um just looking at that [Applause] no I think when Heather did the production she did all the one percent increase on that um which is not very significant but um just so you know let's see someone the stormwater went from uh 175 this year 176 750 and 178. so there's a small increase that she built in one percent um it's in I guess a projection of like in the next four years we're probably going to raise it yeah sort of looking at that I mean we nearly you know it's about 50 of that service annually were collecting stormwater fees but he's working in the city's budget store water projects out of the general fund yeah I know and I'm just going and compared to when we started the stormwater project the entire budget was five million dollars here we are how many streets have we gotten done and we're still at 3.85 because of the increase and comes so right so it just makes complete sense I mean I I don't it's kind of a no-brainer and and that's one of the reasons we're here today we were afraid that this would happen do something I uh I think you did a great job of researching about this and providers with all these we have other questions from Council his only engineering been done for all these streets so they're it's shuttled right so the master plan was a preliminary engineering so it was filled out of design have we ever addressed doing this thing in the right way because people in Council have said wow people see their streets ripped up and they will get a heavy rain and there's flight right after the stormwater the new stormwater pipes have been installed that we ever addressed couldn't catch bases pumps in with the engineers because I would like to bring that manual and see what the total cost of that would be because if you do it right they probably get rid of the cat too strong here so to my knowledge nothing has been put together as a proposal for an engineer for that idea I do remember after the 7th and E Street project so you know cooking some numbers were going to ever fix some of this stuff but it certainly would make sense that when you talk to Engineers maybe Mr Banker can get involved in ask these questions and every street is going to be a case-by-case situation but there's certainly nothing wrong with asking while they're while they're doing their surveys and planning if it's feasible I think another benefit that's been identified here is that you know Francis we have some extra monies available at the end you know we can accelerate the repayment five and a half years and we don't have to wait the full 10-year term which I think I think is great but that's in there because that's not always bonds or loans so it's great that's there so that we have some money available because if they were paying this baby off and there's a substantial amount of money that can be saved from an interest standpoint for the city which is great well this building gets paid off one next year other questions or comments just one quick question so the Ninth Street BMP does that include the lack of that in terms of trees trees the Cedar and the um stormwater issues with those streets like this in 2017 but we did do the dredging of the retention pollen right that did assist with the water forms of the sewers here okay so that's probably something I think we want to take a look at is not address their issues because I have talked with some people there there are issues with the retention mods that the faculty don't have a a stormwater pipe there where we can actually put the valve system to prevent backflow things like that but maybe there is something we can do there that actually put a similar to pipe there to prevent the backflow from the backing coming coming into those areas something like that so we can identify that like we talked about earlier we've talked with engineers what's next questions another one my goal is if I you guys were on board I was a British company let's do it yeah this is just a side of our Chris Rowe will be ready to be here we need to let the documents ready this rate is good until April 7th sorry that it seems like there's a a fire girl but I'm sure race would peel back a little bit so I'm sure this rate would still be the same but if we wanted to but kind of the way move fast tracking this it's backtrack to you all uh it's been over six months that we've been working on it just it's taking time to get things done but in the chain of events will be Chris would be here uh there'll be a approval of the city council meeting first meeting in April and they'll have a documents already for uh the you all decide and then the banks are funded later in the week all right let's find out then let's uh let's see what the general consensus is I'll start with vice mayor Shirley I'm saying move forward um Mr Roberts move forward as well apparel yes and I also agree so uh let's go ahead and get it on the agenda and uh foreign ers [Music] yes um city manager Aretha and I had a couple of conversations and became the conclusion Monday it could be with us on the workshop agenda as he comma has done a great job in evaluating other opportunities out there I know initially we had funded how much was it the problems 250 pounds 850 or for a new generator so I know he's done a lot of due diligence out there to take a look at other available options this particular one is a used diesel generator so Kyle at this time I know you've looked into it a lot you how do you feel about this particular option from what you've looked into so far I I think after the discussion you were kind of caught up on the fact that you want to attach with gas but when we were looking for a more economical option we didn't and we realized that you know we can get a fuel in company to fuel a diesel generator they could also save on costs with a portable option I feel like we've got work to apply as best it's going to get but I think it's much better than what we were looking after see uh we budgeted the 250 which at the time the generator was um you know somewhere like up in 20 and then we got had a recent Source well quote that was please recline quite a bit in this particular used option is the the ingredients yeah this is uh this is off of uh I believe a social equal as well um worth of 97 000 price point and that would be that includes the you know the tank and the trailer but this this option would be to hook directly into the connection points that uh previously previously accessed with the transfer switch there was one other option that we kind of just got um discussed um at least I did with the sales um and I I believe it was about 132 and that was if you were talking to put additional um connection points over in the parking lot um the benefits of that would be able to get you a couple feet of elevation as opposed to be over here but you know you get if we're looking at that kind of flooding I don't know I mean we just kind of way out the situation it really makes that much of a difference because we're we're not going to be here for the time period right and we'll show the generator over the other gloves to keep it operable until you know the water is down if we're worried about flooding possibility okay so this particular generator will provide us complete power to the entire building on portions of the building um so it was a the original design was a hundred kilowatt generator to run cushion this is 88 which is on the three phase so um I mean I can have a art engineer kind of look at it but this is this was because you know the height at the highest demand summer time AC is running and everything you know we we were able to calculate that it would be conservative a 100 kilowatt would run perfect and so the diesel tank is completely full I know you had got an answer for me on that how long would that last so the tech itself is 680 liters of diesel and the you know in the features it's a sub-based tank up to 45 dollars but if you calculate the um the consumption of the years per hour um if you're running a full load um yeah you're going to get about 38.85 hours if you're running at 75 you're going to get closer to 49.2 so again depending on what you're running ahead and get longer so uh you know if we're in a state where we're just running you know we're using this as an EOC and we're running you know the AC on that side and um you know internet connection Communications is not going to be as much as if we had this you know all the units for this room or using it as some kind of uh shelter pause outside of the storm one thing we may want to pursue and maybe you've already addressed this is that the diesel providers out there I know from past experience we can make contracts with them because if we have a catastrophe in the area oftentimes you could be on the short list and if we run out of diesel fuel nobody is able to provide because there are contracts you can put in place so that we're at the top and so when we say hey we need some fuel we'll be able to get it sometimes you pay a little bit of an additional fee up front for that but obviously in an emergency situation it's where it's at so there may be something to take a look at just so we're we're basically guaranteeing so you pay a premium for a guarantee right that if we name diesel fuel we're at the top of the list or close to the top so we're going to get that kind of a deal so that's something we can look into just to make sure because obviously the worst case scenario we have a catastrophic storm coming through our our initial allowance in our tank runs out use some more diesel they're like sorry right but um there are contracts we could put in place to assist us in that area so great job on this because I think this this saved the city a lot of money and I think it's going to provide the solution we need there's obviously exercising of the diesel generators that we need to do on a weekly basis sort of on a weekly basis to make sure it continues to run so that we do need it it's ready to roll Kyle um is there an option for a larger tank I haven't asked I didn't check on that because I don't believe 45 hours is a non-protection whenever Irma came through there were places that were down for 10 days without power obviously we're on a we're on the main line but still something I would like working it's great on the face and so in the entire apparatus is on the trailer correct all right about 40 running full water no I mean how many hours um it's a news generator it's uh they you know it's got a one-year warranty on it you can do it with one kicks it's a used generators or two thousand hours a thousand hours I'm not sure um the only other problem I have is John Deere is a good quick when you use diesel fuel and you store these off your own especially in this climate you get a lot of algae in that tank and bang when they get in problems um I might have a supply of those but anyways you want but I've seen I've seen packages come get contaminated um but you're you've got to make a contract on this right here it goes off but good job any other questions or comments on this I think you answered my question about the um you don't use a one-year warranty on it and I'm assuming it's tied into the quarterly maintenance agreement that fast rate here and you said that there's an option to purchase additional maintenance on that yes so um maybe looking at the costs associated with that additional maintenance as well I don't see it on here I just see the general for the one year I believe it was like a two-year Edition uh it was about three thousand and then you get up to five additional years it will sit in place and have a continuous connection to our system and we'll have a schedule where it starts on its own and and well um part of the maintenance contract bill to come and we'll start it okay okay um and then that's really up to us if we want to keep it it would be back in that corner over there I think the last one they might have kept there most of the time before um but we also could travel behind the building you know if we didn't want it out there all the time I think she's wondering is she getting an automatic store because this thing will have a pigtail if you're going to plug a game like most of the commercial ones I see they will come on everywhere whatever Monday morning at 10 o'clock and they run for an hour comes on I want to say artists Arts uh at the office and I believe it comes on about three times a week because it fires it up so it may be something worth looking into with the question is is how do you connect it from this building to wherever you want to put it down right right we have the cables yeah we're currently happening so you got to run them out the local or come on all right now let's let's find out what that that uh are we on any sort of a deadline right now timeline on this offer um 30 days so we're pretty much coming up on it again it says 15 days from issue date in the day being January 26th so okay how labor prices as portable as what is that what you're comparing to is that your other quote list for a portable generator like this or was that a generator installment on a stand yeah and that was natural gas also correct yes facility and kind of think about what we're comparing to you know that's something to think about then we have natural gas here at the building right it's it's an expensive prize for convenience and so that you should consider also there's always a possibility that something could happen for while it's being transported The Higher Grounds or it would make sense to have a ramp it up and just you know keep it elevated on site and then you start adding costs like that then does it make sense to have a portable one I don't know I'm just just thinking it through and it's just some of the thoughts that I'm having so I it's and this quote is inspiring is that correct is that what I just when I heard yes so it has to do a recourse anyway and whatever you consider portable the only option is diesel foreign so this building is running on generator power turning back will the doors be open to the public to come in here and get some relief from the heat during the day yes will we would we provide um drinking water things like that we have to stop by water gun to get it transported as part of the county of another state yeah Our intention was too when we opened this back up to run AC and have a cooling pot for residents we're providing information on inspections carpeting loans all that stuff out here a storm right okay and that's the only only uh it's the only way that I would vote is it didn't just benefit the office thank you Mr Roberts we had asked about a time frame so obviously June 1st is rapidly approaching with the hurricane season so it would be nice if it's even possible do you think it's impossible at this point Kyle that we could actually have a generator sitting out there private universe then I get verified because when we saw that on the playground around a lot of issues that doesn't show coming out to that point because it would be something that would be nice to Independent because [Music] we've been our due diligence we've got a generator there and of course you know June 1st is the official date for the hurricane season that doesn't mean a hurricane doesn't come through on May the 15th but um that that might be a good thing to have in place if we had that there and let's say June the 15th we had a major hurricane coming through and we lost power for 10 days and we had a generator in place to a little bit and the event well considering that this quote is has already expired you're going to have to get a record of anyway and we don't know what the actual cost will be assuming that the way things are going to release they would just quote currently States um I would also I still would like the council to have both jobs are located permanently mounted whatever that is versus this portable generator I know that this is much cheaper and I'm not going to spend a whole lot of money but at the same time we want what's best for this building this city citizens um you're going to have to get a week quote anyway I would like to ask you to get one of the types of support that we can look at one last time whether you're getting one or getting two I'm assuming it'll be about the same time for him yeah Council option I agree and I know it's unusual to have that in counseling but for me just need to have it for the council meeting if you have if you get it in by then I'll try to yeah not that we can really discuss much but at least we have the information and we can certainly discuss whatever you like there in the city managers sure okay what would the process be if he comes back next month we had to run this through the public place the purchases they're coming to purchase that riddle I don't know Mars are doing anything but just um voting on it yeah I'm hearing a regular Council the two reading requirements with ordinances there'd be no ordinance associated with this as long as it's within the purchasing guidelines of the of the city as long as there was a threshold I would of course look to Kyle and work with Kyle and make sure that we've checked that but ordinarily there's no statutory requirement of paying clearance now if you're able to get quotes before the meeting that would be even better and that way we would have them in our hands and we could look as soon as I can't wait any other questions or comments on this topic okay there may be somebody found with the Strait of Florida I don't know what that title would be but somebody has to be in charge for the state of Florida with regards to all the assets and and there are times where they will actually make things like generators available where they replace them and they're a little bit on a smaller City like Baylor Beach and say would you guys like to have this that's a possibility so the first step obviously would be to come to find out who that contact person is for the state and they have obviously a tremendous amount of generators out there that they use for their buildings permanent installations as well as portable generators so there may be something available out there for somebody like our city that we could actually get I don't know about this city but most States like where I'm from Jersey and Pennsylvania or they're they're mostly at least a lot quite caterpillar or whatever like that so when they're removed it kind of takes them back Jumping or takes them back comments takes them back and then for sale he's saying this state has an allocation that they purchased the whole generator outright yeah I know this with mud we had quite a few and they were very so awesome yeah yeah so what are they doing came away so sometimes that they were going to upgrade they would trade in just like you would have called but other times they may just make them available to somebody who may be interested in them anything else all right well let's move on to item number three to increase fines for parking violations thank you mayor um our community services administrator put together in this local listing of the fines in the area so we'll be focused on what the initial parking violation for overtime parking would be which is you know be okay as a leader and then what the uh if there's any additional charges after so many days they'll be in charge or whatever so we compiled it together um and uh just wanted to lay it out so you guys could have a good look at it on just kind of what the surrounding cities are doing um you know one thing that jumped out of me is uh like alleghenyans Shores you know they are fifty dollar um I guess you'll find and then if you can see most of these most of these municipalities they doubled Their fines after 15 years some don't but most people and it's also interesting to know like um the some of the cities that have their own police department they used to District Court that's established in court if there's any additional fees okay so what are you looking for there Mr reefer um so we we did a resolution to raise the rate spotting meters um worries no when it's cheaper than paying the meter all day it was something that was brought up to considering in the parking tickets and I wanted to present just let me ask you this um who's going to enforce this yeah who's who's going to I mean right now it's my understanding that we rarely ever think to rarely ever written for parking is that is that true well most cases because of the majority of the tickets but we don't um maybe two or three a shift that's every day most days yeah it gives you a little bit more tickets because you just denying is that part was just in this area that would be more mainly boring but it would walk in Marina say hello okay and uh what about parking illegally on the street how often are tickets um I had to check that and the reason why I ask is because it happens all the time and uh if we're going to if we're going to raise the rates and we're going to try to enforce this we don't want to make it cheaper to park and Street illegally and uh and so whatever we do we probably need to do it Citywide and I would think that does very good question though do we tip it do we mostly if it's ticketed on the street it's for someone fishing or something like that like I know for instance someone that got a ticket fishing off of one of the piers that wasn't a city resident you know they not professional a period but they're parking their car industry right next to the sign that says right so yeah yeah um so you know the residents I guess my question is is it often that residents have guests and they get the guests get ticketed out or because I don't know if we're opening a can of worms I agree we need to jack these rates up because clearly someone's gonna I'd rather pay the 35 fine and worry about paying to me I mean cheaper than marking down about down in Clearwater Beach played the 35 dollar fine exactly what are you going to do you're going to pay the ten dollars for three hours or 35 hours a day right right yeah I am thinking that we're the hundred dollars worth yeah I just don't want a resident's guest to get a hundred dollar fine you know that's what I'm I I'm concerned about I guess would you say 100 hours straight up first I think for meter not feeding the meter not paying your uh parking fee and while we can certainly have that discussion I would just like the opportunity to research our ability to do so um as you look at the um the hot the highest on that chart is 75 the mean median mode tend to track closer to 30 to 35 there is some statutory Authority as you look at Florida statute um 318.18 and others that might suggest that number needs to track closer to 30. I would of course um you know I would look at that I think that looking at that number um the fact that there is no outlier there in this community suggests most of the communities track towards that story language I'm not telling you you won't find a community in Florida that finds that I and I don't know if they've been you know if they've had legal analysis done on it or challenge it but I don't I I OMG with my client to raise it if we go as high as 100 you if there is a challenge to be had you're invite it I'm not saying that there certainly isn't like an opportunity to analyze that a little more cool he's been the last I looked at that meaningfully was about three years ago obviously a lot happened session a session I'd like to make sure that that Authority is current uh you also make a recommendation whenever you come back with those answers absolutely sir I I wouldn't recommend a precise amount but at least recommend what I think is maybe a suitable range yeah a range that you may wish to consider but well I already applied right whether they see you see they have no late charges yeah but every other Beach Community is at least is that the caveat here well I don't know yet Madeira um is that the thing oh I'm not saying that at all and please understand that when I get advice advice may not always find action um I I would give you advice and you folks can decide for yourselves what you what you're willing to to move forward and do but I I owe it to you as you Workshop in this to raise there's a reason there's likely a reason why you're not seeing that because I'm sure you as legislators and community members are not the only ones who you know I said some wouldn't just some of you in other contexts that anything that's punishable by a fine is legal for a price right and so there's that that notion and so I understand what you're trying to address um but I I owe it to you to just make sure that that issue is discussed so um going back to uh vice mayor Shirley's questions about okay I have the gas a 100 ticket for parking in front of um I think that that situation is a little hard to address and we don't really know what what the situation is going to crop up I've never seen it an issue but I'm asking do we know coming tickets have been this year in that circumstance they will take a Broad Street Park and give it to repeat offense for most deputies are they there to the side of Education first I think there's also a provision that you know if you're having a party or something you can call and say I'm going to have six people hard on running on 22nd Street in front of my house you know they stay on one side of the street because I know we've done that for the condos if there's going to be a huge group call and say tell anybody you can park on this street so they can't even do it without a ticket you just tend to until I say plan ahead I know there's a lot of on-street parking on my street and yelling at this ticket but I'm just asking because I wanted to be to bite us later as being a problem you know so and I've never had an issue I just want to make sure that we're not creating a future problems I've never had that problem either but uh however I will add that I have driven down 22nd Street many times and there's a car parked illegally right next to the bridge and you can lower your window and even warn them go in the house for a few minutes turn around and come back I don't care they don't care they're still doing the same thing these this is what I would like to address because it is a problem you go to other communities somewhere else even over in Bel Air and because they allow parking in the street two cars one on each side you barely improve ment I moved away from that I moved away from Seminole but a very reason well then because I like water um I I that's the last thing I want to see is just more and more cars coming into the community and just parking all over the place I think maybe if the council agrees with me maybe what we should do rather than having Randy reply back at us first off are we all in agreement if we would like a much higher much higher fine and uh do we have some sort of a cap or am I just uh do I sound awful I say a hundred dollars well and the reason why I'm saying this is because uh what I'd like to do is is a Randy to uh to work with senior manager wheeler and then he just gave us something to vote on whenever we come back but I want to know if there's there's a specific cap that we do not want him to go higher I'm going to say if we use this guide no lower than 50 and no 175 and then you can add something you know after 15 days like they've done you know but but I think to be to say hey we've done our research and this is what all the surrounding communities are doing and if you look at the beach communities they're all they're all at range yeah I'm fine with that and I think that we can see how it impacts the problem uh go ahead and Mr Roberts and how does a couple quick questions so let's just take the marina for example more history how how do we identify with the current parking system that we have that somebody has not put enough money in could only expire currently have to walk around a little fun and vehicle look in the on the dash and see a ticket this is the time okay so I'm sorry to tell them right then that at 1 15 PM it's done and it's now two o'clock so they'll do a ticket right okay how much of that whatever we decide on how much of that ticket money goes to the city all day all over the current system works which is our own tickets okay and it with the new system that we're getting ready to implement do we know how easily that's visible to a deputy that they expire their time the new system is going to be a lot easier for the deputy because they're going to be able to call list income paid plates because they enter the parking lot so to be able to just cross-strike a point perfect so they'll have access to the automated system yes to say okay seven and nine expired perfect that's great okay and so then they could write them a ticket at that point for x amount and and we're good okay and we did agree to 100 pull the old meters out yes and the one thing I'll just add for context um and I'm not saying this is across the board in my limited experience from an administrative standpoint where you see that change in rate past day 15 is the if you come and pay it in-house and date within day 15 fine we don't really have a lot of administrative costs added to that after day 15 we're sending it to local ordinance violation court now there's administrative charges they're processing it and you're you're one you're getting less capture on that but two there are additional administrative charges associated with that being prosecuted pursued otherwise or just simply processed um is this why they have the after 15 days that's yeah that's when that's why some communities have after 15 days it's and that depends on that Community their ability to manage such a process administratively bureaucratically however be able to describe it but it's if you can get to our Clerk or somebody or our system if you have it online by day 15 fine pay the 50 bucks but then day 15 we're sending it over to the court they're going to charge us a filing fee and all these things and so you know the rate changes and so that's my experience that's been my experience in other communities I can't say unequivocally everyone does well it's interesting because Clearwater says 23 you come in directly and pay the city alert give us 23 we're good get ready you'll see some of these cities don't actually have any so that's their partnership for other violations okay so yeah I always think that and just to simplify things the time went double after so many days it didn't stop of the Pia that goes along with having to administer this yeah right no no further nuzzling at after 15 days and then just halting does that sound reason uh that's typically how it operates there's no it's not it doesn't accumulate thereafter it's not like a daily code enforcement fine that compounds typically it's flat amount at this point flat them out at that point and then and then it's just handled either it's ignored or it's made all right uh if everyone agrees uh please uh something like that in the Gemini and give us something to vote on okay just as a follow-up for the uh part mobile the contract's been assigned we're supposed to assign a project team to install you know the signage and give yourself a crying um I'm going to fall back up the timeline is for that so currently we just but depending on the timeline just because if we're going to raise the rates on the current machines there's a programming fee charge that if it's a matter of weeks um okay and did you put it in my packet yeah pardon do we have the resolution for the mayor to sign I thought it was already signed you know I have um I'll go get what I have I have several things in there for you to sign okay we revised there wow yes because the addition of the effective date and the three hours versus no hours limitations was revised to incorporate that so we need signed as passed all right whenever we take a break which will be in about 20 minutes okay all right any other discussion on this before we move on to item number four all right item four discussion of the 12th Street beach access so I put that on the agenda and it was on my regulation of the council meeting but I'm after going back to the audio and listen to what it exactly was said um I believe you said that um the discussion of you know non-residents being on the beach maybe a discussion in the future but it wasn't actually a an item that was supposed to split the work session um I know something about the bike rack um I just want to update we ordered a couple of new load of recycle plastic benches um given that there's three dimensions already added 12th Street I'd like to start with just one additional lunch to no other Park actually has six benches so you know and I did bring it up in the Parks and Recreation board meeting just reviewing assessments of the parks that I wanted them to look at what the amenities were at each Park and you know make recommendations as a city-wide basis of where we need additional metrics and such as I recall there was someone asking if we could put five racks in there and but they were also the same residents that were complaining about non-residents using the beach access so I think if we put bike racks in we'll create the ability for those non-residents to come to a park all day at the beach and use up for the beach access so I don't know there's a conflict in what they're asking for in my opinion I think they were talking they weren't asking for the bike racks they were complaining people were chaining their bikes to the benches and you could sit down and couldn't have a bike rack so they could change I think somebody at Council brought up to based white Rags there and there isn't it and I brought up that you know all the cars had to have a stick on it but what you just said is you can stand there on that bridge at 10 o'clock in the morning just watch all the electric lights come over and they filter the Sixth Street 12th Street and they parked there I've got pictures where they've actually set up tents like canopies two bikes the sea wall they put like two bricks on the sea wall with the cover and draped over the place and uh looks like Coco but um I wouldn't want to see any bike racks there and I think it should be a Parker like there you have to you should have to have a stickroom well hey yeah that's it's almost where we're ready to go to because it's another vehicle and um you know I don't really know what the solution is we we discussed this back whenever it hit the fan Over The Umbrellas and covet was going on and only reasonable solution that we could come up you stay you put on whatever it was you were taking they said hey I live here and and that was about all we could come up with bicycles unfortunately they're getting more and more powerful they have longer battery life and they go fast and that's why there's a big push not to allow the e-bikes on the beach at all and it could it could be that we have control over that lot we can pretty much say where we want to on that lot and we could just say no e-bikes allowed and in that way if you come onto the beach at least you you've worked at the swim to get there instead of flying over but um it's a problem being on the sidewalks I mean they're riding you know sidewalks all right I agree and all of the uh the beach communities they're having to address this in one way or another and many of them are are seriously considering just Banning e-bikes all out I don't know I don't know what the solution is for about our age I suspect that it won't be long before we start getting those scooters that are all over Saint Petersburg in Tampa that's where they just litter everywhere because they have a homing mechanism on them and the crews just ride around and collect them every so often Office drop them off wherever and there's they don't even have to be responsible for them they just let them kind of walk away and that's that is one of those companies to show up in Indiana wrong speech and we will have them we'll have them on our sidewalks we'll have them on our beach so I guess is there anything for us to do on 12 I don't know well I don't know either um and I was a we just have to decide if there's really anything we can do and if it is do we won't go to that extreme where I'm sorry we require stickers for your bike to identify the residents you know and non-residents and then once they get there what can you do about them if there's a bicycle on that lot what can you do about it and I'm not I don't want to carry a tag to the beach I'm I mean we're not New Jersey we're not doing that I'm just sorry well we attacked to the beach you know like a lanyard saying I'm a resident yeah yeah I know I know and that's why we didn't move forward because it residents a few bucks a year ready for me sir what what's your thoughts on tagging our bicycles I can't say that I've specifically analyzed the issue of tagging bicycles or other multimodal transportation to the beach um you know I think my bigger my bigger charge or reminder to each of you is that the beaches are public parks um in in general in a general sense and where communities have implemented measures that were designed to limit public access to Parks they ended up getting sued they ended up entering into consent judgments with the ACLU or some other entity where where you've made it clear you know and I'm not suggesting that's what you folks are specifically doing you're trying to address you know nuisance and detritus in your beaches but where that dialogue starts to push from we want to do it in a way that we make sure only residents are there that's where you're going to start to see each other challenges okay so but it's not really um we're at a disadvantage and an advantage with three lots where there's three mods that are dated ax has from Bel Air Beach and my question is is um because we're already regulating and saying you can't park here because you're not a resident can we do the same thing with Buy sales you can a braided in your body resin I've not specifically analyzed it as the short answer the longer answer is I I can see the analogy there I think from I think the bigger issue is as the vice mayor has alluded to the the Practical elements of that you know cars are registered to to you know with the DMV you know they come to um there's somebody if I just ride my Schwinn and leave it on the side of the road and you have to hope that you find me at the same time I'm going back to my bike to know it's mine versus you know anywhere from anyone else in junky public I think that there's from an administrative sampling a hard and more difficult enforcement element all right and then what about nuisance bicycle parking so they come up to the bench and they chain their bike to where people should be sitting do we have any repercussion on that I mean I think we can make it a violation of the code to you know adhere your bike to any structure not specifically designed for bike structure to include but not limited you know benches signposts Etc again the issue is going to be to whom does that citation issue if your Deputy is walking the beach and sees one on a bench and I'm not saying you shouldn't regulate it for this reason just understand if your Deputy goes there and you know Belinda says Hey Deputy the bench right over here at the 19th Street access it's it's got three bikes on it okay I'm going to go over and do they do they leave it on the on a sticky how do we know that it gets there you know put it on its own laminated lanyard in hopes that the people find it and don't allege that it was you know discarded or lost in the weather um I I would have to I would also like the opportunity if we do go down that road to talk to to whether it's pcso or other other units and see what if anything other just we wouldn't be the first one who had this problem what Solutions in other communities device and can we Implement them how about just the sign on the bench please don't change yeah yeah certainly and the same before most communities and even those communities who have chosen not to regulate smoking on beaches for example because of the carve out for cigars it it really relying on a thank you for not smoking yeah we're not going to issue you a nice compilation but yeah you know it will get some people or at least people who just weren't sure um somebody's still going to be like what do I care I mean I was 17 once I know how that works um you know what are you gonna say to me uh but I think by and large you get most of the of the general public captured through that rather than creating a bureaucracy around enforcement plus we have enough signs out there they can change it to the side right you know typically everything if you ride your bike you're watching the sunset if I just couldn't leaning against something and you're watching the sunset they leave I can't imagine someone just leaving their bike there I don't know not all actors are rational actors and I go to the beach often but I have not witnessed advice is the bench but I'm not believing it right no um we're talking about the beach accesses so do we have can we put regulations in those Beach accesses with our ordinance I would have to I'd have to specifically see what documents we have about that again that was kind of my point on the front end of if this is intended for public parks and public park access less likely on the mayor suggestion there are some Lots where maybe the analysis is slightly different regardless once we get to the point where we're if we get to the point where we're talking about real policy I would want to make sure that we've made those distinctions and that's and those kinds of questions are answered um you know obviously a different analysis right you know going on on the edge of City Hall versus in the sand on the way up to you know in the Sandy areas or edge of the page pavement as you get to where people access beaches I think you know that's where you're likely to see bigger problems for sure I think your point is though yeah oh is there a property that's straight up and different it's not a problem it's not ours to regulate I'm I'm operating on the Assumption we're discussing city property whether we have needed access to property it's not our property to regulate just as I make in my neighbor and easement to go over to get to their the lake if I ultimately decide to you know they can't come over and say I wanted to move along this way and put these papers because I'm losing your walkway and some mind walkway yeah okay okay so at this point I don't think that we have any action items or any of them are we in agreement yes okay all right uh let's see here now we're on the item number five uh this is discussion to move Council comments immediately following the citizens Commons it was placed on the agenda by council member Baker and Mr Baker yeah so this actually goes back to number 12 because the same Resident was wondering why we can't get an answer with the council it has to be late until the council's comments at the meeting is residents so if the residents are really the integral part of this city I can say submitted two resolutions about being able to address citizens towards citizens one of them but some of the arguments were well we could get into a repeated debate and everything okay since we don't debate canceled comments why can't we just move this to where you after citizens comments the council person wants to comment on whatever the citizen said we can do that if not it just felt it does but rather than having citizens stay here all night long which a lot of them don't do it even that citizen left uh I think it should be rude because I believe before I was on Council citizens Comics were either the second or last night they were moved I believe they were moved to the end of the agenda by mayor man so and uh and that was I don't know why he did that and then I did a resolution that I didn't ask where we moved the citizen comments to the beginning and the reason why I did that was because whenever you make the citizens wait till the very end there's no one in here so of course you were able to pretty much control who spoke because if you had an agenda if you were pushing an agenda you would get your people to wait around to the end or Shore up show up towards the end of the meeting and then to keep us here all night long with a back and forth dialogue and so I asked to move them back to the beginning but I was not able to uh I didn't because I wasn't the chair I was not able to stop the back and forth and so the show that was it was happening at almost every meeting instead of us sticking around for another hour or two and almost killing each other uh it all happened at the beginning of the meeting before we got to the regular agenda so so I made some notes on this side of it it's okay I'll go ahead and let you hear my my thoughts on it um for the sake of meeting the patiently agenda items take first priority because each council member has taken the time for careful consideration and preparation they know what's going to be on the agenda and so they put a lot of thought into it and because we approved the agenda that's the very first thing that happens we can run through the agenda in the order that it's um that is presented uh citizen comments will move to the beginning of the meeting so they can be heard without being required to stay late however these comments are not on the agenda therefore if a council member would like to respond they may do so after the approved agenda we only moved we only I only move the citizen comments to the beginning to give us time to consider what they said and then towards the end of the meeting we decided that we want to have differing opinions on whatever the citizen comment was and we wanted to have a discussion it would come after as it stands the way that Mr Banker is asking we would have not back and forth conversation with the resident but it could turn into where we're having a heated debate before we actually get through with our general business and our regular agenda that we work so hard to prepare and it was sort of derails for the meeting uh also let's see here I just wrote down Council Comics are at the end of the agenda let's see if specifically to address the the direction the meeting went uh the various agenda items we went over citizen comments and items they would like to discuss in the future however they do not come before our approved agenda and the reason why is because a council member may want to respond to a way that a certain vote went okay Mr Banker a great example we do the council comments immediately follow the citizen comments and then later we have we vote on something that you feel very strongly against when it passed well now you have no you have no voice to speak on that topic and so that that was kind of my general thinking was I want to get through our general business first and then I I appreciate the citizen speaking and I respect each and every one of them however I do not want to put their personal their personal attendance ahead of ours until we have time to think about it possibly put it on a work session and bring it up for a formal vote if it's something that we feel strongly about and that's where I stand I agree with you totally right now with the council comments up to the citizen cabinets I could just address some of your points true okay you prove that Dana has you know he says comments Council comments so it's always been to my understanding and the two years that I make a comment other council members can't really become it dies after I get done true Council can say I didn't like what happened during an ordinance uh any type of agenda item the council has the luxury of always debating that before it goes to a remote so even if it goes to council comments or even if Council Commons or first and they're not last it still dies anyway so my comments or her comments or anybody's comments whether you get them out during the debate is up to you um again the citizens are the most integral part of this city let's answer their questions while they're here if they're not then just just this part will die I appreciate your comments um I'll take more yes I don't think this is going to be a perfect solution to this issue um because you know praying so let's say some people come up with a citizen comments and so they want an immediate response I did that if we move that up forward because we want to make it more time effective for them there may be people here that are waiting for item number seven on the approved agenda so now they're delayed so they're thinking man this is over 30 minutes now and dinner's cooking or whatever so that is it's being less time effective for those people that are waiting for specific agenda item you know I think there may be a way and I had to bring this up that if we had a special line item in the agenda that wasn't exactly titled council members comments something else that was right after the citizen comments and we still had the council comments at the end was something that would be available to just address the citizens said but I think we could potentially lose a lot of time here because it would be uncontrollable potentially but how about would be a back and forth each of us would have an opportunity to address What specifically was mentioned in the citizens comments and we may say nothing if we had it right in there they say okay is there anything for whatever you want to call that and we could just say and look at each other and nothing mayor would say nothing we'd move on um and you have that right to intercities of course okay you don't have to address what they bring up what I'm saying is there was a woman here was concerned about her handicapped child so if someone from Council can say I'm going to address that I'm a city manager but [Music] [Music] I don't she's not going to debate me I'm not going to debate my confidence all we're going to do is address the most important people you're given consideration to the people that like this book actually I think what you're doing is you're picking and choosing um which person you you are setting the agenda whenever you you force a response but what I'm saying is the Free Will of addressing it or not addressing it you know I'm not saying you have to address it not anybody from counsel has my position is not forcing Council to address it in common citizens conference it's giving counsel the opportunity right after season times but it would never be a back and forth just like just like since just like Council comments now I would like to hear other opinions I've served um under three Mayors and in one mayor in particular allowed comments and it turned into back and forth the way we're doing things now is very efficient there are times I have to say where I want to respond to someone I get that I mean it's very difficult the way we do it now it's hard to move on when there is a question asked and we can't answer it was basically whenever they're demanding an answer but truth is is that there is a process it's very efficient there is a process that um you know you could ask the question you can pick up the phone and call any council member absolutely anytime you want to you can email them you can whatever and if you don't get a response you can really become pesky about it and get a response eventually but uh there we work very hard to make these meetings run well and as much as I uh respect your opinion I I respectfully also disagree I appreciate it and uh and it's not really the way that I want to learn the meetings other comments take a informal vote on this I appreciate where councilman the banker wants to acknowledge their comments and I do appreciate that what you stated about it's hard sometimes when they say something however at the end of the day we have to think of everybody's spent so I'm agreement at least keeping it as we are in if there's something that we feel we need to address at the end if they have to leave for whatever reason the minutes are always available the videos available they can always come to us and find out next so if they bring something to the table and they're not willing to wait until the end how big of an issue was it really or when the interest of time if I had something that I really really heartfelt about I'm going to stick around to the Embassy if somebody addresses it but [Music] um many times I read as a resident a citizen will come to speak to address the council and only one council member knows that it's coming okay so that one council member is prepared our answer ready to go to give this person however it may not necessarily represent the views of the majority and that's been one of my biggest fears and that's what happened to us in the past was that there were a few people that were getting attention over and over and over and and it would be that they were able to steer and control the meeting and that's the last thing that I want is for any citizen to come in and and hijack the meeting I do 100 believe that we should at least listen to them and and then selectively determine whether it's a a some sort of an issue that needs to be addressed or if it's um it's not one way or the other anyone else yes and I think they've got a very good point earlier which was the citizens made their comments which is great and I hear it for the first time and Jesus brought up again I made um want to respond immediately and not really think it through so I'll be honest with you sometimes if somebody asks me something like that and I'm ready immediately after that to respond to it as opposed to by the time it gets to the end of the meeting I may have thought it through a little bit more and chosen to not actually say anything at all at that point or hopefully what I say at the end of the meeting is a little bit more thought out based on the comments that the citizen made so sometimes it is a benefit I know of me personally to calm down a little bit based on what somebody may have said and way later to talk about it that's just me uh one of the things that I do the way that I conduct my meetings are is I use other municipalities family as an example we we do that in not just the meetings but we do that with a little bit of everything Kyle I'm sure that you've reached out that other municipalities and hey what do you guys doing it's always a good practice I mean we're we're actually watching what's happening with uh with Indian wrong speech right now to find out what their future holds and so um whenever I look at all the municipalities and I surveyed the Mayors on the big cities I knew that this was coming up I asked him hey how do you do it what do you do pretty much everybody runs it the way that I'm doing this the majority of the council would like for me to change it I will I will absolutely do that but I I ask for each and every one of you too please allow me to continue because I think we're doing a great job yeah this isn't any reflection on your job that you're doing and I think everyone's starting to go off because I mean if you're a little bit high-headed why would you address it okay you would wait or maybe addressing the following one all I'm asking is the council wants to address it right after citizens Commons it should be interested thank you would that also include if one council member confidence on the citizens comment and can another council member comment on that other council members comments you know I mean are we opening up well not directly well and that's in historically that's what's happened yes is that whether opening up a debate the possibility for a debate and I can assure you right now if anybody here says something to the citizen then I strongly disagree with I'm going to end Uso I don't I don't want that and I guess I just don't think that it's healthy so let's do a quick informal note if there are no more comments about this okay with that yeah all right I'm Frank I'm afforded no I'd like to leave it as we have it as yeah as is okay okay and uh and I feel the same way so I appreciate everyone's comments and now let's move on to item number six also on the agenda by council member Baker discussion of the normal puppetry at 804 Harbor Drive yes going back to the prime Escape services that came out clearly says in their reinspection is recommended in one year to moderate any changes we know there was some follow-up on this and we reached any type of resolution to the Atlanta owner of that because it's I think it's under an LLC from what I've researched about the removal of that tree or anything so the prime escape the one that this the city solicited I have a date of November okay I'm sorry that was the other ways the other guys are we going to be doing together survey on that my thoughts at the time were given the intentions brought to the tree that in a year we would reassess As you move it from the owner on that property the owner was agreeable to letting in miles to remove the tree just didn't feel like he needed to be responsible for that tree that how about the nuisance ordinances we had because I went to the county I guess it was November or October of last year and uh accountable or less said well if you guys can't afford it we could probably come out and remove it these their their accounts will actually looked up our ordinances and said I think I emailed you that I think I emailed the councilman um he's got money problems but um so we're not coming up doing anything what they said here we go [Music] we will clearly show that trees possibly the harm of falling into an easement into a house that should be removed so I know this you're saying that the owner says if you want to cut it down but have you ever thought about citing him for it my opinion was given the report that I was given that the city solicited there was a slippery slope to enforce this trees and eight years tree because I feel you would go around the stadium employing a lot of trees and then in a different situation all right I know me personally I own a lot of properties and someone's tree grows on my property I have to cut it myself they're not and I have one right here in Largo and some adjacent property to an attorney and she is not cutting the tree back I have to do it and I spend about five thousand dollars a year keeping this tree trimmed back so you know it's not the trivia voice mayor it's the possibility that's the reason I turn it that's the reason I choose to trim it is to save my property you go into property to trim it yes because I know she's not going to but that's something but that's easy giving permission then it would just be a simple phone call to whoever's house and it might you know whoever's concerned about it they could take make a phone call to the owner and say hey we'd like to remove the treatment mind get him get a written letter from them he didn't say that you would sign the documentary let's go back a little bit I thought the last time we had a discussion about this that you were going to reach out to neighboring the people that surrounded that property foreign um because they all wanted gone and so I think the question is is if they do agree with that you said that the homeowner is not he's not against you removing the truth is that right so so what's the difference so could we just top it you know what I'm saying about half of it all I just want to be really clear about the pronouns and antecedents we're using here about like we and us and they and them what the manager has discussed is if the neighbors privately wish to amass some money and arrange for somebody to do it the property owner has indicated that I soon provided they coordinate with him that they can do as they well pleased but he has no intention to do it the we us them is not the city at this stage yes no no it's fine it's not a problem we're looking for a liaison somebody to say or do this and it's about 75 units down to 35 feet residents decide I'm sure you could give them the phone number to reach out to the owner and well I think they'll create it it's a little more complicated I think that the the property owner does not like those Networks and I think that if the city was doing it he was okay with it does that ring a bell yeah he's been much more agreeable and I've communicated with him right I think you I think you're turned by the way like resonate to hate yeah I wasn't going to go to that far but um is there a neighbor that he likes that you think that you reach out to I mean well if because I hate to put I don't think the city should be able to know right I think that's what Randy said right right can he mediate a letter though he can do as he wishes I just my my concern here is I don't want to compromise the city is what I'm saying yeah I mean my advice is unless we have a code enforcement action which at this point the manager is clearly communicated is not the direction the city's moving in the city can facilitate by saying the residents you know residents are interested in you know their name your neighbors are interested here's you know do you have any objection of me sharing that contact information or is there a you know a person I can put you in touch with to coordinate or put them in touch with on your back maybe if he feels that way and he says hey I have a property manager or I have a lawyer they can call my lawyer and figure out a time I don't want to talk to those people and I'm not putting words in there as it's not they know nothing about that property owner or any of these people I'm not characterizing anybody but if he doesn't wish you much in the same way the residents are somewhat suggesting in like the city manager facility perhaps he has his own agent or off or somebody he can put them in touch with him they can have their you know third parties talk to one another right so maybe you could ask the neighbor make that phone call right yes if I can get okay I'm a little leery of our commissioner being the name of a council member being a neighborhood I just can't my my my field my that's just a not another full legal thing it's more of an Optics thing the idea is oh yeah it's a neighborhood they're the council member the council member has been very vocal on this issue and it it's going to feel it may be characterized as more heavy-handed than just like oh my neighbor I recognize you wear both hats I just I I do want to sensitize each of those Optics so um thank you I got a change you've added this onto the agenda so um you know obviously you you have a uh you already have an open dialogue with the brands of surrounding this tree um and there's only one I think he dislocs right I think I think well partially with this works does it I'm looking for guidance you know what I'm saying right this is one of those we had a situation um in fact it was a vice mayor Street uh with a cul-de-sac and just went down there and said hey you guys come out here and just work it out and they did it made they're not 100 happy but they're at least they were able to work something out this guy's in Vegas you know what I'm saying it's was it hard for me to get in touch with them no I got them with an email he changed another umbrella okay I can imagine um I'm going to run a fighter citizen begin and see where we want to go and I might be asking you for the email if that's okay this is what I will do if I were you I would go to those those residents that are concerned with a tree and first ask them if they will be willing to work together to the paper the tree removal and then I would find a non -associated resident with someone else to make the phone call and then you step away from it because it's not a it's just really not a city as radius stated it's not something we want to get to involved in because we don't want to appear to be pushing someone around understood okay well we weren't voting on it but you were just in place problem and this is the work session we can talk about anything yes if the neighbors who are complaining about it have been told that they can take it down and then the owner says that's okay and maybe this is a question from Randy or is the lawyer in me can they not complain if the tree falls on their house you know they were told they could cut it down but they don't and then it falls under their house I'm not going to apply it on private properties private property owners rights or defenses um you know much in the same way that the commentary has thus far been this absent code enforcement action the city doesn't have a role in this in a lot of these instances and the mayor's offered other examples where we've asked people to either be good neighbors or work it out themselves if they have private causes of action they wish to bring or can render and I'm not suggesting there are or not but that's for them to decide and in the same vein if they feel that they are you know waiving some right defensive power that's for them to analyze I want to plan on it okay um before we end this does anyone have any comments this this okay because what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this as a Segway only for the Henry's that came in earlier I know that they're not here but they may look at the video and uh but I'm going to ask from City Attorney Laura is just an update on the situation that you're working on with Tower is is there anything that you can share with us at this time or are we still where we were the last time we received an email about it so for the benefit of all and to make sure we're all on the same page last Monday I believe it was I transmitted a um or maybe it was Sunday night I transmitted a memorandum that was Monday because I needed to talk to Kyle um I transmitted a memorandum last Monday night to you uh I want to say it was in the neighborhood I know it was more than 10 pages I can't remember it was 20. but it was a late theme memorandum analyzing providing the chronology of events as they as best understood based on staff records and otherwise providing an analysis of the federal regulatory landscape the case law interpreting and the state landscape case law or absence thereof interpreting it and our local ordinances and then how does that all align with where we stand and the the Cliff Notes version of that for for all was private property owners have rights and we have to reconcile those rights and this is a two things can be true and since we seem to be very comfortable invoking Indian Rocks Beach uh tonight I I will invoke Indian Rocks Beach and it's it's debate and discussion on short-term rentals as an example where certain Property Owners say well what about my rights I invested in a quiet home on a cul-de-sac now I live next to a hotel or a motel and there are some property owners that feel that way another property owners say this is the this home has been in my family for years or I recently acquired it and why I acquired it doesn't matter it's my property and I wish to use it in this way that the state law allows me to use and those feel mutually exclusive but the law supports both and we have to find a way to balance those interests as best we can as regulators and so where the landscape stands presently is while I certainly recognize sympathize with and understand the articulated concerns about safety Aesthetics consistency Etc as it relates to the antenna structure um operated or that exists at 105 8th for amateur antenna radio operation the law also provides a property owner who wishes to engage in that hobby or operation as long as it is an amateur basis which there's every evidence thus far that that's what's going on that zoning alone just simply saying well this is a residential area you can't do it it's not adequate in the memory spoke extensively about the specific back finding that needs to go into that the effort to negotiate and reach a reasonable accommodation which is terminology you usually see associated with Adas and those other type actions but taking that same uh Paradigm client here a reasonable accommodation requires you to actually delve into the very fact specific scenario being proposed here and understand that and so what was done the memo concluded with a bulleted list of the kinds of questions that we would seek in the restatement that the property owner's lawyer and the City attorney both agree that a permit is required for this structure regardless obviously this is not the kind of structure you permit on a regular basis the usual paradigms may not fully apply as to how the former what the form requires Etc and so while there are certain elements that will be required we need to know where it's going to be in its Dimensions there are some added questions that we've we've articulated I um I want to say it was by Thursday of last week I emailed his attorney with communicating those questions and some more indicating that his administrative contact was manager refler I haven't had a chance to see if he's contacted Mr rufa but thus far not I was going to ask him tonight and then follow up with his attorney and call tomorrow if that had not happened I'd indicated in that email that it would be preferable if they are submitting a permit to do so post haste and preferably in the next 14 days or at least explain why that may not be a feasible time based on what they need to compile or otherwise you know so either do it in this time or at least let us know what what time we can reasonably expect and why um so that there is some motion forward and I've communicated at that team Mr Pinker that day and so um I I do know that Henry's came in and introduced themselves briefly to me and spoke with the mayor from what I've overheard there was some concern is there is there any possibility that this could exist in an antenna structure could exist in this neighborhood from a legal sample I'm not saying that it is I've done deal is there any version of this where this is possible yes there is does it have to look like what's there presently I don't know because that's part of what this process is is designed to determine for example this immature operation requires him to go to x feet and his roof is X feet minus three is there a reason help me understand why it's not reasonable to say fix this to the roof or fix this to some other element on the property um and again those questions have been posed we're waiting for those answers and that's where we stand working through it I I understand the um just because this is now being addressed in a public meeting and there are public records that have circulated in the form of communications with you I know I've addressed this with some of you I had the opportunity to speak with individually um I also want to address the point that this posture is not because of some fear of litigation my practice regularly involves litigation frankly I prefer it to late night meetings but litigation all because of what I do here I also know and because I am a litigator I know what this looks like on both sides and I know what it is to litigate on an undeveloped record or on knowing what the case law is and saying well you know part of the language Damn the Torpedoes were forging ahead regardless if I can set you up for a better defensive position if we even get to a defensive position that's in Better service of the client on a risk management standpoint and as just a general litigator um you know the other idea that their legal counsel has bullied us I I want to make it clear in the record as I said in the memo their legal counsel while he does have a position to be different from some in the community has been a a consummate professional and is dealing with me we've had candid exchanges he sent me case law I sent him case law and we've discussed our varying points and by and large have reached agreements at least on what the general overarching legal principles are what that looks like in execution it may be different and again we're navigating that thus far there has not been in our exchanges a bunch of posturing or you know gorilla chess beating on I'm gonna you know I'm gonna Crush you and you will see it can we find a solution here I think we can bring this in for landing my client needs to make better permitting submissions absolutely we're prepared to do that we just need to know what the city wants so we're not so the goal post doesn't keep moving I'm not alleging and they haven't accused us of moving Coldplay's just let's have shared expectations and get to a Finish Line um and and then determine if something can be reached or not um so that's I know I've kind of uh rambled at this point so I'll stop but that's where we stand I'm happy to answer any more targeted questions if you have them well nine years ago when I moved here he had an antenna probably about two wishes Awards there on the side of this house yes sir and but it was very so it took off in the way you know what I'm saying okay where this is a town because that's that's going to come that's going to project uh and and both in it and I said this before both you guys did a marvelous fabulous job at the hearing foreign Doorway to come in and when we shot him we shot him because of this if we do yes sir yes um and and I would submit to you again that while I'm suggesting that there is a possibility and not necessarily a definite probability that I just don't know because I I it's I know it's cliche but I don't know what I don't know yet I'm waiting for particulars before I could render anything but just because something maybe allowed doesn't mean it needs to be allowed in the same manner that it is now I will say that as a testament to the um civil dealings between the parties his attorney has represented to me and at this point I had no evidence to the contrary that that antenna has not been vertical in 2023 and likely really the last two months of 2022 as well and would not be going up until we could resolve this so that no so it's not to antagonize the situation or create additional enforcement issues um mayor I couldn't help but over here though I was working on another matter that the Henry's had suggested that the precise location of the tower may have moved recently possibly closer to the home though perhaps still on the side that may be in direct response to my communication to his attorney which was consistent with the memorandums you know one of the questions he had was while we develop a proposal what is permitted as of right geminine and I said again I'm not a building official I'm not the manager I can't say if you do this it's fine but looking at our code one of the elements is the site setback and it would need to be x amount of feet from the site setback and so perhaps one that moved and I don't know this I've not spoken to his attorney this is pure speculation but it seems consistent with the fact that I made this transmission on Thursday we are here Monday and it seems to have moved away from the fence and towards the structure I don't know about footings and concretes and how how it was moved and what was moved but it seems that it's moving away from the setback again consistent with the direction we're moving in of achieving compliance which is what is what his Council stated um to be clear that the it is presently on a cranking mechanism I I've heard the the resident's concerns um I I don't like to qualify them as complaints so their concerns that you know it seems that when he is operating this and he's the assistance of needs or employees for whether he needs it or not the assistance of Youth you know his teenage friends and Friends people he hires I don't know it's it's sort of besides the point and there's a concern of are those people always going to be around when it needs to come down if there's some kind of exigent circumstance an unexpected storm or something that that requires it's coming down when that time comes and those are all things that we can address but presently it is it is more again in its current um configuration it's really more akin to a utility not a tower that's sort of attached to a shed or something not a tower sorry utility ladder or something of the sort that it's a large aluminum structure for sure that is slightly maybe incrementally above the fence line if you're driving in the front but it's not teetering over a home or a property line at this and that's what I've asked the neighbors it's it's uh it's just notifying me if you see the tower go up I will notify and I do plan to contact his Council tomorrow again I was waiting to see if there have been some contact I just didn't have an opportunity to talk to Kyle today because of my other caseload but um given that I have not yet received an email and I also have to check my SPAM because he has an unorthodox email address that sometimes gets routed there but by tomorrow I'll confirm whether there's just just confirming the receipt of my email if nothing else the actions seem to be consistent with that so you don't know if he's going to submit more than within two weeks or not because you're not at that point I just haven't heard back from him I I again the to the extent I have any confirmation of the receipt of my email it appears to be that action but that speculation I would like to talk to him and see where they're at and if they take issue with anything that we I didn't send him the full memo though of course it's a public record I distilled his concerns and addressed those in the email at that time the council I would like to apologize iOS for a long during this book before the break we're up to General business but what I'd like to do is a comment about that or can we still comment on this on this week okay yeah okay so we were uh we were back to vice mayor Shirley she had questions or comments okay just a couple of comments um regarding the tower and that is um first Randy thank you so much for all the information it was a lot to digest but very helpful I was I was receiving several emails and um your email helped clear up some things and I appreciate that I I want to be aware of property owners rights and I'm very cautious not to overreact with the residents reaching to us oftentimes we want to please the resident that's complaining or reaching out to us with their concerns and not not really take a step back and look at the overall picture so I just wanted to caution everyone on that and when I was thinking about some of the concerns I received from adjacent residence I also got some comments from other residents that or Jason this property that had no concerns at all so there's both sides but I brought me to think about the sign ordinance that we just approved took place at 35-fold in people's front yards and I want to be certain that we have thought that through and we have a permitting process for those flying poles and what our expectations are of them because this technique is even more than that black hole just food for God for me to discuss it right now but first thing that came to my mind when I looked at this antenna um okay thank you very much all right any other discussion on item six before we even died I'm seven non-general races all right item seven modified city code section 2-335 okay regarding an appeal of the city managers decisions to add must be done in writing and served by certified mail this was added by council member Baker Mr Banks yeah this actually goes back to our number six or not number six out of the power discussion and um I was saying well how did he appeal this and and he said well he sent some email to the city clerk and I think the city attorneys gave me more animal because he says he has to check his spam tonight because of certain emails this poor soul works hard enough I whether she has a checkered spam every day or whatever I don't I don't check my SPAM I don't know about you guys I can't believe we don't have a better system or serving or an appeal with the city manager would deny something that's important so I'm not exactly 100 sure it should be under Section 2-335 but you can just showcase what I'm saying is there's there should be a system that we have there should be a way that it gets appealed the fashion that we know about it oh well I sent an email you know and then now you're searching your email and some spam accounts actually delete on their own after the 15 30 days or whatever so um I just think it would be a proper way of doing business so um I understand the the hell there was a slight mishap recently and and something was overlooked or it wasn't picked up at a timely basis and I agree with you on that we need a better way of doing it I think I I don't know if it's really a certified mail is a requirement some people just they never go to the post office and deal with that but I think that we could certainly have just like we have a permitting process where you have specific forms that you apply to complete we should have an appeal form if you could complete and you should submit and you have uh the the city clerk to sign off that hey I received this and then you give that person a copy something that just like every other form we do I think it's just something that was missing from our collection documents are total agree with what you said there is that sound acceptable rather than changing a changing a letter but I think we would still just said I was wrong anyway so yeah so so um the reason I shook my head in regards to this is appeals appear in your code in a lot of different places in different forms I do want to be very clear especially because you've expressed some concern about this in the past council member Bankers as it relates to appeal the code enforcement master code compliance and the special Mastery order there is a very there's a very distinct process for that um you know set forth by Statute and otherwise so notices of appeal for a special Master's decision are already dealt with the appeal as related to the manager's denial of a permit in this particular context really is is comes from your board of adjustment code Provisions where it sets the powers and duties and one of them is is under 9462 sub uh bean and C one of their part their powers is to hear and decide and appeal from an administrative decision or order made by a city official where there is alleged to be an error in the order or decision in the enforcement of this article and that's what was really being evoked here I found an error or what I believe to be an error in the denial of this permit and then the next provision in C is the city manager shall receive and process each appeal to the board and then it goes on to say you know within I'm not talking about days but just disposition um I think the mayor has touched on something that that could be a solution here without the need to go on a first and second reading of Shopify by arrested mail the only thing that I would suggest is and Kyle and I can work on this is to the extent there are you know whether it's part of a permitting package or other things where we regularly communicate a decision having writer language you know any appeal of this decision shall be submitted on a form to be produced by city hall or made available at City Hall and you know adding some language to the city website on if you wish to file a video please use this form disseminating that form in that kind of way so people are aware of its existence I I would hate for us to be in a position and I certainly wouldn't um you know find it problematic if we said oh you didn't find our special secret form um without necessarily being aware that it exists and how to access it um if if you know and I I'm speaking without the manager having added some input on this I was shaking my head about that you know that was the provision that God came here there's various appeals referenced in your code and I was you know when we talked about a code review one of those things that we would want to harmonize if we did get to that point and I know the manager's got some some Future Vision on how what that might look like but that's what I wanted to add as far as flying machine hit my head and also what potential Solutions might exist subjects of course to administrations input well I like the way the layers put it you know I don't know why the group just attach it to a denial you know when you informed if this form must be filled out yeah it's just part of the process Is keyless schedules across here could have it noted you know this is needs to be the proper way s um being that you know there's some parts of the administrative appeals discussed in the code would that hold up though if we just present it in that way with a denial um and we perfectly provide the needs of yeah I mean it certainly goes beyond what we're we're doing presently I don't know and in as much as we're sort of now signaling the people Beyond here's your denial and if you want to peel it figure it out because we don't get legal advice I don't get legal advice and he says what do I do if I want to challenge it the code addresses appeals and managers decisions do with it what you wish um and so in that regard I think it would be sufficient again I would want to make sure that we're checking the the notice box of letting people know and that's what we're talking about doing um again I wouldn't reinvent the wheel I would look to other communities and say hey do any of you have especially because we serve about a dozen saying seeing if anybody has a sample that they use in their communities to to trigger that if not we can develop one it's not that difficult I would still submit that you know I want to be clear what we're really talking about here is the notice of the appeal the it's not necessarily you know they made their after half additional items they wish to supplement with and you know in that we'll really want to address is give me the notice what was the what was you know fields we would want for example by whom was the decision issue because it's not necessarily only a manager uh what was the decision date what was the content of it attach a copy of the decision you're seek to to appeal if it is in writing et cetera et cetera I'm a bit confused is the appeal of a decision on a permit request is that I'm I'm confused because that there's a standard permitting process it's just the process right so they didn't like the answer they got from you on something you denied on their permit so they resubmit I I'm not in theory yes I mean you can revise and I don't know I'm not understanding why there's so much conversation about this appeal and why they're appealing when they just would resubmit and come in and talk to you well that is that is a preferred solution at first but if if you reach a terminal point where but I want X and the city manager saying I've read our code you're not allowed to have Excellency well I read your code and I think you can I think you're reading it wrong um and we had that situation not just in the context of that data structure but another property where we were talking about sorry another property where there was an interpretation relative to what could be built over grade or over the first floor and we you know staff was reading it one way and the applicant and their agent were reading it another and said take it to the board and said I think your managed to read your code wrong I think I think your code is being administered and so you know and so and and again those issues certainly sensitize us to those instances as with the more recent change on the variants oh not variance but the setback and Bellevue Estates that's an example of where like oh we've discovered an issue we need to address it but until that issue is addressed sometimes their only recourse is not to revise no matter how many times they revise they're not going to be if the interpretation is you can't have this well I think I can and then you know so that's why you get it's not frequent I mean maybe I just am a magnet for them you've had two in my tenure but outside of that it's not common but you do want to make sure if you're having the process that it's administered consistent and this is this is uh dealing with just the city manager saying no the only way you'd ever get this is through a variance or the code changing or code changing and then and then they want to challenge it without going to the variance process and that's the appeal where we're referring people is that right Yes except to say that again the scope of the upheaval is the allege that there's an error in the order or decision in the enforcement of the article um so the basis for the appeal is not just like I don't like the answer of guys I think he's doing it wrong I think they did the wrong thing tomorrow that the only kind of pool somebody could have is an above ground kiddie pool um somebody's like well that doesn't seem right well that's just how I'm reading it you know somebody would go through that kind of process to pick in a certain thing that could get you to a real result okay um any more comments or questions on this topic just because we're talking about the code um just in my you know four months of PC managers a lot of issues when I would say issues but just questions with the code and I think it would be beneficial to to form another Review Committee at least with our residents because I know we talked about like a major overhaul but um that that had a monetary like a price to it but in the past five years since I've been here um recovery boards have been formed in different areas of code work I'm selected to be discussed and uh there's some points that like bring up looking at it we've done it once on the council and once you know you were on the council first go around I I'm out of line AR probably has it been how has it been I don't know I thought that I thought and then Reeves had it done but what's happening is they're focusing on bushes and grass and no one has any construction experience they're reaching out to Residents to read line by line for this code if we're going to do it we need to hire a professional who can help us with construction code and talk about are we going to put in some architectural design parameters and things like that you know we ended up with this your pool can be higher than the grade of the road just stupid things that can't get changed by having the residents do it and that's makes absolutely no sense when you have a you know your finished floors at 14 feet and your pool is at zero you know it's just makes absolutely no sense why those codes have been changed and modified like that and I think that if we're going to do it we need to do it right and spend a little money I would suggest too is you talk about that you may wish to consider the the Paradigm of having your code of ordinances reviewed one way in Your Land Development code reviewed another when you treat them as similar you're right there's a very big distinction between do we want to limit the skate park hours from 8 to 12 or only allow these only rollerblades and like these are the kinds of legislative I'm not trying to trivialize all the legislative but those are very distinct from you know what grade is and how you're defining whether you're measuring from the crown of the road or you know from BFE and all those kinds that's hyper technical where your Land Development code goes and also Land Development code May because it's land use may come with attendant issues of legal impacts and over down zoning this or and I'm not suggesting anybody's trying to propose that but you know Land Development codes can add more collateral impacts than changing purely legislative regulations on how other parts of the city are administered so when you talk about a code review there's most codes are subpart a is your you hear the laws you can break and stuff are B's and here's how you get to use your land um and so that that is where communities have endeavored to do a code review sometimes they bifurcate those two okay um what's that I highly recommend ous I think we uh we can't get down the road a little bit just because we wanted these two settle down and deal with the immediate problems and we go back and we and we focus on that and what I recommend is uh pretty much in alignment with Randy is that we we tackle sessions not the whole thing we we just focus on a couple of areas and knock it out for a fact that make sure that it doesn't impact other areas and a little long instead of all at once I think that it's probably too much to digest if we do it all at one time thoughts do you want me to start looking at um through the county if there's any kind of consultation all right assistance they can provide or rather than going private with we're talking land use codes and construction codes of options um you know the average residence does not have very much experience um how about the league of cities to see if they have um you know someone who can assist us with the construction land and ultimate code I might have some resources foreign [Music] some parts of the flood code I'd like to have considered so there are other parts okay so I mean I kind of looked at it I believe in that fashion the the CAC to operate in that way the code review because it's not about Land Development or am I incorrect in that blood code is in your lane develop Windows yeah and you would have to you know on top of any consistency determination with your comp plan that you know we definitely would want the plan or remove reviewing for consistency with County elements and all that okay and I would like to add some feedback to on the foot when you're if you're looking at flood you know there's some things we could do on the lots that front water that are Waterfront add some code and compliance it's not there that new development is not doing that they could manage the runoff from their prompting and their roof line at right out to the interposal rather than onto our streets that we're still kind of jam on the streets or is there cool yeah and no one I mean it's a very easy thing to do during construction but it's not our code and so we're not no one does it because it costs and uh I think Mike Kelly had mentioned that there were there was death I didn't quite understand it but uh thank you so um yeah so right now where we're at we're doing the comprehensive plan with the planning his own inboard so we have to get through that after that it would be the assignments so then I guess I don't know all right any other comments on that buy some air Shirley no what's the plan of the pack on this obviously we're waiting for this one base of finish and then what's what's up next after we talk about the compliment yes okay so um right now we're working on the advertisement we have the dates that I cannot remember okay so as soon as that is done then it'll serve as our public hearing for the recommend are they total from the Land Development board okay um all right and then uh well any other questions are all mad at all or can we move on a general basis over there okay um before I start is anyone have any general business okay so I been thinking about many things um and first I want to say [Music] I don't want this I don't use it I I can't make myself learn what I had I just I'm great with computers but this is not what I want to do and I'm going to for the next few years so I'm gratefully returning it and I don't know what we're going to do with them but I look and I don't see anyone else are you using your yes allow any City business on any of my devices it goes right here okay all right all right well I I just use mine for email and I'll I'll you know construct a document or something but everything's being archived contribute if we ever get any records requests but I just I I have no use for it and I like the fact that we have all of these uh documents in fact I purposely did not pick up my packet and I wanted to see how I can do on my laptop and I had actually worked out well I write notes on this and I viewed the document here and I'm okay with that that being said how many of these have been turned in already you think it could be a third okay do we should we liquidate them does the staff have any use for them I I don't know the good news is is they were paid for from the Department of Justice grant for code so it was the the idea as I saw that um if we ever were in a situation together uh well is it all right if I store money here then sure okay great or we should post you have a paper list yeah okay um so the next thing that I want to bring I'm going to try not to keep everybody too late um I still owe um I still owe you guys a marina plan and we haven't done it I I have told Kyle that I was going to get with him I just have not had none and then of course we had the situation in the family and I appreciate everyone reaching out and uh sending their condolences I'll get there okay and we will have this conversation and it will give you something to look at and debate over the next thing is um as you know I'm on The Big C and uh what what I I also attend the mayor's Council of Pinellas County meetings and um there's other other councils committee committees and and whatever that I could be involved in what I have discovered and this is probably on me with whenever times were hard and we weren't very happy um we we voted to do term limits before I go any further I am not asking asking for term limits to be changed for me but I am asking this Council to consider add a third term to whoever is next and the reason why is because all of the mayor's Council of Pinellas County The Big C uh some who's leading from the cities I believe is in the same shape is that I can't serve as an officer and I can't do it and so what what happens is I really don't have as much influence on other communities and the county as I would if I were able to serve as an officer and unfortunately whenever you're a two-termer I think this city is probably learned that um they're probably not going to be in many surprises this community is probably going to watch it and and somebody served on the council before they elect a mayor unless it's somebody that's already served and then they come back in but in my case I serve on the council now I'm the mayor but I'm not eligible for anything outside of right here because they all know that I'm turning out at the end of this term and so um I'm not asking for any action items or anything tonight but I'm asking for all of you to kind of consider this situation and are we doing the very best for our community that we can because what I see is that other communities are having more influence over over the whole area where as we're not really considered anything because size and also because I can't serve on as an officer and that's how you make changes so something to consider I know that it would have to be on I would have to be on a ballot during an election to change our Charter again another something else that that speaking of elections in our Charter in the way that we handle things I know that we're on this three-year thing and I'm beginning to wonder if it's too expensive if we would save money if we just ran our elections with the general elections rather than this odd and all you know in March and one year and then like maybe if we had four-year terms instead of three-year terms and we we had an election every two years and one during the regular general election and then we had one thinking about and and that's really about it yes I have always thought personally that term limits were a good thing and I was just thinking that on the federal government level when you see people that are in those positions for eternity abuse and for some reason they keep being reelected and it almost looks like they're not sure what they're doing it's just the same I think at a city level and I heard this guy on the radio just driving home one day and he said ice made for term limits now it doesn't make any sense to me because whether they if somebody's not doing the job properly you wrote the mouse it's not difficult to do that so my I just paid over to the other side I am 100 against Germans I've had more than a few citizens talk to me specifically about this issue so I should have brought it up I forgot I think my guess my first question is when do we if we want to change the charter how ahead of time do we have to submit whatever we need to submit to make it go before a vote does anybody know that answered I can't tell you a precise deadline as it varies by-election um yes usually a good my recollection the last time I did so it was like for a March election it was like December 15th you know in terms of getting information out and and before that December 15th we have to have had a vote on the ordinance in the form of ordinance and resolution on do we have this and then if we do have it what is the ballot language read so it there's definitely lead time right um it's not something you decide you know a month or two before the election okay um you do the it's also not a year out either so I just want to make that comment I agree with you 100 I think it uh I think it just makes sense and I think clearly at a city level if um somebody's not doing the job that these citizens feel that person is doing and they're running it they're not going to win so that's simple I disagree with that well as Nancy blows you who's one of them said when AOC was elected if you put a glass of water on the ballot in that District you can it would get elected the populace isn't in tune look at the numbers coming to the polls polls less than 40 percent sometimes 20 percent um there's enough people to serve and I think there should be a refreshing of academic Council a Congress of a senate every few years I was totally against the terminal I was like I felt exactly you did 20 years ago but how the hell can I personally Nancy Pelosi State offices how can people like Joe by who's never done anything but what I'm saying it's Federal but it's the same thing government starts a global lows okay and then it resonates that's why I was so concerned about going into applying issues anyway now you know going in there um I think there's I think everybody in Bellaire Beach and have to serve on Council for one terms a big military-style required to carry uh it's like Purgatory okay yeah there's Catholics they don't understand what I'm talking about my understanding is historically there was a time when this city could hardly even get any money right to fill a position so somebody would be in that position and they wanted out and they were told somebody tapping on the shoulders you know nobody's signing up for this would you do it another term so I don't think there's enough people here that really want to do it well that's but that's my point and there's not enough people that go to the polls so you have to get people involved I think the last time there were a lot of people doing yeah I see I see both sides I mean I definitely do because when you're new on Council it probably takes you a year to gear up right so there's a big learning curve and so I I seem to lose a lot of time in the beginning um I also I just have this conversation with my son-in-law today we're talking about term limits and I'm in support of it but not I think we've limited it too short I think with this last review we didn't you know it was when we voted in the term limits and um um the last Target review and I think two terms seemed like a good idea but I think if you've served my Council and then you're in a mayor's position and that changes things I the learning curve is not accounted for just some things that you know maybe we should take a look at it is all I'm saying I'm not um I'm not sure how I feel about it but I see both sides right because what happens in six years you know you're on Council for six years Leslie and no one steps up to take their spot and we can't get that chair filled I mean I don't know what I really don't know what's gonna happen in that election when we can't fill the chair for no reason regardless how many people applied to sit on the council we had before but they didn't have to run an election that was a little different yeah you I don't know so this is kind of my take on it is that all right let's just say you're serving on the council your first time you're you're going to be on the council with some people that have already been on there for at least a year or two all right and so you have to start building a relationship uh well then you run for May or later and it starts all over again you don't know what you're doing whenever you are now going out because you understand how this Council works but you don't understand how everything else works and so you go out there in Leslie can testify to this because she's done it you start building relationships and you start figuring out how things work and how and and once you establish those relationships you have more power to to benefit your community than you do just by yourself and so um it's something that I would seriously like everyone to consider what I will say is that if we decide to do this I would like to make sure that I am not eligible that it would be this new the charter would go into effect and because it's only it's the right thing to do wouldn't that impact everybody right now City attorney to say we're all elected under showing you on the court um short answer I have to look at the language I I wasn't sensitized that we'd be having this discussion that way um we would have to look at that language of course when you're drafting Charter amendments you're legislating and we can write it how we want to write it based and ultimately what you know if you seek to have an approved what you think would be more favorable that way as well but not necessarily we would just it would be in part be how we structure it and what we're looking at I'm not intimately familiar with beyond the third term limitation what your German language president looks like okay but I didn't even think of what you brought up earlier which was the inability of somebody who's in their final term is highly unlikely to be elected for a position within the county an officer that says don't say within the county say it's an office earlier then because I don't want anyone to think that no no no you know what I'm saying yeah so but there's some limitations there or just human nature you know when people are making a recommendation for somebody to to take away your treasure than your secretary secretary right you're the chair or the president and one or two-year terms I would not be eligible so not only that but they didn't know who I was whenever I first started so really the second term would be the only way to afford Bellaire Beach to be fairly represented out throughout the county of various communities would you agree with that Leslie yeah okay yeah I know that the mayor's luncheon I went to there were some County Commissioners there and they they're in contact for us I mean but again you've gotta if you're just in year-end and you don't know what you don't know but yeah it takes time to figure out your footings yeah yeah and I will add that that the extra year because if you remember I I was put on the big scene the year before this term began um it actually did give me a leg up is someone new coming in coming in a new mayor they don't know anyone and so it actually bought me an extra year and we made quite a bit of progress so just something to think about and I know that the uh the the size of the term also could possibly be impacted if you wanted to run elections during a regular of rather than the I don't know what the implications would be for Patty but uh not bad and mayor I I haven't looked at all the bills filed this session I know that the last two sessions the legislature has tried to compel all municipalities to conform that way so and again I'm not suggesting that we'll happen this session but we always have that added fun element of how we'll reconcile that if that Fiat should come down from Tallahassee and these are the same people that are wanting to bring in partisan this is going to be a very interesting session for municipalities and you'll be getting memoranda from me shortly on where the bills are standing now that we're about two and three weeks in a session yeah uh okay and I think that that was all I had other than Kyle uh when do we began the official budget season the end of this month that turned into uh to Heather or uh what the budget that I prepared and she kind of puts it all together um I believe I'll check the calendar I don't have it on here right now but I believe uh the start of May okay that I'm gonna okay great uh and um this is it that everybody can go home I keep promising you updates on the beach nourishment and what's it uh I met with Kelly Levy who is uh in charge of Public Works foreign path and filled with me and uh um this is Pinellas County yes she is on board with accounting County funding the fully funding the project if we don't get a positive answer from uh from the Army Corps of Engineers and and various people in DC um when is that deadline because isn't that an approaching or has it that rich there's no deadline because they start moving out of work again we're not even fighting for a deadline right now we're fighting just to ever get anything right okay and so we're already two years out because there's been no plans so we're going to have to go through at least two more storm Seasons before we see so you're saying there's nothing going on there's nothing going on I'm not a shooter because people keep saying is it going to happen it's not going to happen I keep saying slender no no it's not going to happen so because again they've not even they've not even begun planning so I have been meeting with all of the and one by one in fact tomorrow we're taking Chris lavala for lunch and meeting with him and showing him how little each there is down in North Bradenton Beach and trying to make sure that one by one that they're all they're all buying in and so whenever we were finally told hell no you're not getting any of our money in the Army Corps of Engineers it's not going to help I'm working diligently to be from the county Pinellas County that they will 100 fund this project because we have the money they have 35 million dollars right now waiting to do something with it concerning peace nourishment and um and that's our money we whether we liked it or not these airbnbs and and all this traffic and everything that's going on we we sacrificed for that money and uh if we get that 35 million or whatever percentage State always kicked in another 20 I don't think they're available and I don't believe that they will commit to anything unless the Army Corps so this is going to be all pro this will be all an ounce County doing it but we do have the money and the way that I'm approaching this and when I say we not us the way that I'm approaching this is you're reinvesting and you're getting ready to spend millions and millions on these baseball complexes and new stadiums and all this uh you know hundreds of millions of dollars um well what do you think got it all here it surely wasn't the middle of the uh of our Peninsula it was the beaches you know reinvest and put it back and let's keep doing it and uh and so I'll let you know after at our next meeting I'll let you know how it goes or I'll contact you and send you an email it says hey you can share this with the council you can take them down the sister anymore uh last chance to say anything else for this meeting otherwise I'm going to promotion for Germany all right all in favor all right thanks for being so patient it is a great meeting"
