kodak is present hello hi do you know patty and carolyn carol yesterday hi yes lunch that day okay perfect okay anybody else have anything to add under citizen comments all right we're good there item number four um let me just ask a question about citizen comments sure are you referring to the the box we had out during the last session about citizens comments and suggestions well that would be number five that i'm gonna get to in a minute that i kind of put an arrow forward because they are locked in kyle's office and i didn't know that okay so i'll get to that in a second but no um so the discussion about new member recruiting volunteers is basically like we're very happy to have these two so now we have a full board and our alternates again which we haven't had that in probably a year so like we so appreciate you guys um wanting to join our group and so our um our recruiting efforts paid off so that's all that was it was just a thank you because i knew they were coming today to kind of check out the meeting and then um item number six is kind of in lieu of george's question um review input from that we actually got some things in our suggestion box that we put out at every event or anytime we have our community table out we put the suggestion box out and we actually got some at the fly me to the moon event but they are locked in kyle's office so i am going to move that item forward there were only four but they were good suggestions so we'll review those um at our next meeting if everybody's good with that were they just suggestions for the fly me to the moon event or no there are suggestions like christmas lights and someone suggested like an easter egg hunt and then there were some other like little happy notes about you know good job and keep up the good work but there were there were some suggestions in there and things that you know are possibilities in the future so we got some input so i thought we should review it that's what they're giving it to us for so anyway um but speaking of the fly me to the moon event so agenda item number six to review that like we always do um we do a pre and a post just to kind of say good bad what we can improve upon or what we saw that we could do different just so if we do that event or something similar that you know if there were certain things that we could do differently big or small to make it a little bit better that we would do that so i'm just going to open up the floor for discussion and then i just have a couple of points in regards to the budget and whatnot so i had a question do we have it out on the board i didn't see it until you mentioned it to me that day at lunch i hadn't seen the advertising for it and i drove by probably you know a few times a week yeah it didn't get frozen until i think either the night before or like that day it gets frozen so there's no alternating but i know sometimes when you're yeah there's if there's five or six things on there it could just be timing and like when you're looking over but it had been on there for at least two at least two weeks if not two and a half did we do flyers though flyers are like twelve hundred dollars and we can't put them in people's mailboxes so literally we could we do nicole does a really good job of like posting on bellar beach facebook page next door neighbor app it's all over the website and then we can use our sign but other than something that's quite a bit of money and we only did the postcards one time and i had it was 50 50. half the people i asked said they never saw it so you know i got six of those in my mail yesterday i literally take them and chuck them like so i don't even know we were hoping because of the bellar beach logo on it oh is it um so to answer your question we did that for the first like set of events and we probably decided it took up too much of the budget and didn't have enough impact just but not enough people saw it like when we didn't do it and we had a similar event it didn't like we didn't lose people and we didn't double the amount of people so it was just it's not worth the money oh and it goes out or constantly and it goes out in constant contact so we have what like 300. i have to do that today like 400 names okay someone i just i can't remember who told me they said i've submitted that piece of paper three times and i still don't get emails and i'm like i don't know why but um we know who it is yeah i'll get back to you on that because i know it's one of my neighbors i can't remember which one it is i think we put out some yardsticks too oh yeah we do four like they're small though and they're just kind of i saw them little posters like was after right after entering like valor beach sign yes you head south i did see them after you after you mentioned it so maybe we just kind of phase out the noise so i didn't recognize it until you until you told me about it yeah i think the only thing we could do is something similar to what we do for the blood drives which um i know the they're really good about putting them in those little sliders in the park at morgan park and like on if but i think there's only like two or three of those the dog park the dog park sometimes have it in that um they have a glass at least yeah the shadow boxes yes so they're really good about putting those in there yeah they're in the dark to the dog park the blood drives i see them yeah on the other side of the ribs two dogs i find what indian rock speech does on that big entrance they have that huge banner of with all their events really works but i feel like the cost of doing that like we could do it at coachmen but it would kind of not make it so pretty i feel like the cost of always having to and it's not we can't do it on the bell or short side it would be over it would have to be and yeah and it's not like well it hits the angle but i that's costly too right yeah yeah all right because it's it would cost as much to pay someone to hang it and take it down as it would be to have the sign made like i know they have a permanent sign but we're not there like they're like twenty thousand dollars no there's a roll-up banner too is yeah yeah but they have a bucket truck to put it up they have a yeah i mean we have that capability right here there's two dock repos the wire going across causeway but we don't have the capability to put anything on it yeah got it so i think we pretty much i mean not that we've covered everything we have the digital sign now i think yeah and that's on the facebook page on the best of ability of each group friday group ballard beach unofficial yeah that's great yeah yeah i post about merchandise we went bonkers yeah so people are seeing it just yeah what was the turnout does anybody know there was like 120 i think kyle said that was pretty good i thought yeah especially with the weather especially with the weather because i know a lot of people thought it was canceled because they pull in didn't see anybody and left but even though the sign was frozen on rain or shine i guess maybe they didn't think oh it's in the building like a wedding so i don't know maybe we put move inside for rain or something something more to the point of where we are um and people were just kind of confused on what they could bring and what i mean we literally had people come in check out the lay of the land and then go home and get their stuff and then come back and they're like oh a table oh we can bring our lawn chairs oh we can bring this and i'm like yes you could bring everything but an umbrella okay so i'm sorry how many people do we have currently land on constant contact it's about 400 and how many residents 16 okay what do you mean how many residents yeah that's what's their first year the maximum number of people that live here that were participating in email and constant contact okay so 69. if we did it would be 16. yeah they don't we've tried it many times the people don't want to give their email address because they get like i mean we got lots of complaints during the election about the emails they don't want to get that because it becomes a public record sure it was so easy to go unsubscribe and then you didn't get another one right and then only to that like you could be specific as to who you wanted to subscribe to like just because you unsubscribed to like the political stuff didn't mean you didn't get the the city update or city newsletter or the event calendar like you don't cut yourself up from all of it right yeah so that's a struggle here we've tried two or three different ways trying to collect people will tell you i'm not giving you my email because i don't want you to i don't want to get all the guard which is basically what they said yeah we put them out i think at the last three events and we might get five six people sign up but we don't push it real hard i mean it's not like we're walking around like i did with the cannoli tray going person-to-person i wasn't doing that with those pieces of paper going if you don't get our you know information on our upcoming events here's like the form we didn't do that i mean maybe we could try it but i mean the people that were there have some way of already knowing about it so it's more or less we try to need to get the people that aren't seeing it so what are the smaller signs saying that you mentioned earlier that we're like on the side of the bridge what do they say yeah just whatever the event is and the details i'm sorry it just says the event and the details like the date what the event is i thought you'd put something out there that we're asking people hey if you're interested in information from the city no it's more flying to the moon or pet parade you know saturday yeah we haven't done that it's saying that maybe in the past you guys have done something to try to like drive people to sign up i think the best time to do it is when you're renewing your parking because everyone has to come in and i think that would be a good time to pedal that out hey you're renewing your parking that we have come in once a year maybe you've changed your email address you know and kind of a small explanation but we can't be there that would be and then maybe have some bullet joints on what they get whoever's at the front yeah yeah the benefits of you know by getting this you'll get city events city newsletter information about storm like whatever safety and then put with an asterisk you can unsubscribe to certain parts or like whatever i just attach it to the forum so yeah i think that's a great idea even if it's just a sign up so laura's not physically having to remember to say it every single time she's got someone at the window it's just like you know like the blood drive poster we try to put something up that catches people's attention and then then maybe they ask her about it fill it out and just hand it back to her and you said lynn we have about 800 people that basically buy the parking decal currently right here you you really got to look at that because in most cases it's two so 400 people yeah or it's still the same number of people maybe 500 in total i wonder how many of those are the same i wonder how many of those are the same 400. well even those emails are duplicates we know that oh they they're duplicates you know like a husband will sign up wife will sign up the kid will sign up all in the same house so it's not actually 400 different households so it might be a couple 200 yeah okay and that's the way it's always been what the problem has always been even when we did things like the undergrounding i sent an email out to all the residents at dei if you want updates on what's going on with the underground i sent a letter to them i told them to email me so we could send it i got 10 out of 120. wow they don't want to give you the ring though but that didn't seem to be a problem affecting the turnout yeah we had good turnout yeah no we advertised it like in the city news we have some constant contact a couple days before we remind them so it's it's getting to the people that will really are signed up for the information but there's just people that aren't going to give you any you know they don't want to be bothered you said there were 1600 residents 16 33 do we know how many households 1200 and 74. that's with condos and houses 784 houses and 400 and something pounds 420 i think but half the condos are empty because they're either snowbirds or random gosha well on a good note too i had kyle send me a recap of our budget because everything that we do like when we take it to city council we'll like lay out the event and we'll do the estimated cost like if we know exactly what it costs like say the ban was 800 we'll put that in the estimated and then we'll just carry that amount over to the actual so i had kyle for all the miscellaneous things like the water and the cannoli and the ice and the decorations and things that might be off here or there an amount we ended up coming under our budget which was great so and i don't think that there was anything that we wanted to do that we didn't do like so except for kyle forgot to order the balloons but i didn't give away trophies that was a problem we gave away the job has been started so anybody else have anything overall i think it was good i think um what can we do to improve it or do we need to well again no no i think the one thing about because we i think we missed probably at least 25 to 30 people because they thought it was canceled because of the weather so like something more specific on the sign that we already mentioned just say the event will be moved into the building so like if the weather is questionable so like they know as soon as they if it's not raining but if they're hearing thunder and lightning which is what happened to us we put one table outside and it like the sky lit up and we moved it right back in and to be perfectly honest in my personal opinion fly me was ten times easier than the jazz event because you know how many times all of us ran up and down that hill in 100 degree weather sweating at 4 30 in the afternoon because you can't i mean you can't go all the way around so you're cutting through and we're trying to carry those tables like staying on the sidewalk it was just so much easier to have everything kind of contained in that room and to have air conditioning and you know to have the refrigeration right there and you know the cannoli didn't melt and well is that something that we should consider doing just having an inside event maybe and how would we change the the event itself if one thing i noticed is this band was very loud and it was perfect for outside but not if you're sitting next to it or something yeah i didn't notice that it was loud but they could turn it down like they have a volume yeah no they weren't all that some of them were so loud that you couldn't talk to a person sitting right next to you yeah i didn't notice that but yeah i mean but that's just kind of i mean if we did it indoors we could change a number of things i think something to consider yeah you know tables i mean we could set up tables yeah everything's easier done indoors i think outdoors is really nice though but it's just in the right conditions you know so i can't really plan that but indoors definitely the setup you can set up the day before you know and have it all ready to go it was early for rain you know i mean we usually don't go into our rainy season until june yeah so it was early yeah well the thing is is like if you drove right over the bridge it was pouring down rain like officer joe came over and said oh my god you have to have it inside it's so rainy and then we really we got a beautiful rainbow yeah and we got a couple sprinkles but it never like dumped on us so i mean we maybe could have done it but like people were able to move outside onto that little deck area and it was very nice they think that if they wanted to go outside they could and it was cool and so i think that was good i'm just thinking that if we had if we planned it to be inside would be better or worse or in terms of what we had to do and the better it was more work for us less work i think it's less it's less worse but it's nice and the music is you know one thing i guess i thought you know this would be nice if like we could affect the lighting but it was early in the day so it's not like we were gonna turn it into like a nighttime indoor but if it were indoor you could do it later yeah i was gonna ask about that why did we choose that time of day because we were supposed to be outside and it gets dark mosquitoes everything kind of sun down goes in it's really hot in the middle of the day of course it's just when the temperature kind of breaks so we decided it would just be kind of on the cooler end you know but before sunset and then and there's no light back there so when we did jazz it was black the second the event ended you couldn't i mean and the mosquitoes swore oh they did we were eating alive for the 20 minutes ended just at the right time that's why we kind of looked at when sun we googled when sundown was going to be yeah but indoors you wouldn't have to worry about that but then you lose being able to sit outside you know with the water and music and well it's something for future events we had trial running it worked out well for inside yeah maybe we do it again or maybe we do it outside we we need to consider all those things happening yeah it was great to have a trial run to have to move it indoors last minute and the only thing i look like a deer in headlights when nicole's like what about the food truck and i was like because you know it was supposed to be in the back and people couldn't go all the way around but we moved him right here and i think it worked out great were they happy i didn't get any feedback on that yeah no i mean they didn't say anything so i'm assuming it was fun it was busy i saw someone there all the time and trust me my kids were making me run out there a lot so it was great i mean very good i was always a lion it felt like yeah new york nicole is from the canadian border apparently yeah but what's he doing here he has a place here oh like 70 50 but now i mean he said he's bringing the trailer back up there it goes there for summers snowbirds wasn't he literally leaving like the next day or something yeah because he wasn't in tarpon that the first friday so that was right after because i thought i'd see him and he wasn't there so he already left the trailer so when she first called him he's like no no i i can't do that i'm not in new york and she's like well we're not in new york either yeah it worked out because it's very hard to get people to commit without either us paying upfront or having a guarantee of how many people show up like we there you killed a lot of people and that's why it's very hard to find someone that will just do it so twice we got really lucky the ice people the first year or for jazz and now the pizza people that was the second so that's sundew what kind of food shark does he have grilled cheese sandwiches it's like the top can we have a grateful dead it's a great idea until you have to really like deep dive and find these people no one wants to come without you committing a certain amount of people well who's invited and what's really just belair beach how many people are coming well we don't know it's not an rsvp and it's just the last minute it's a back out every time they just want a commitment so either we have to use our funds to pay for that and again if it would rained you know that would have come in an hour before i think we would have even lost more than half even though we brought it inside and then you're out you know it's hard to find anyone to come into a small thing like this any kind of um you know the lanterns or anything to scare the mosquitoes away the citronellas we've been like slowly but surely like after jazz we ended up because we borrowed them we didn't really realize we need them we got two of those big tents because like sitting out there in the blazing sun like we put two of the tables underneath the tents that were purchased so we're kind of doing a little bit at a time and what's in our budget which you know i think if we were to plan like an after sundown outdoor event we would explore that but we haven't had to do like citronella yeah lanterns i don't even know if we could light things up the area was so big where people were spread out at the one outdoor event well obviously like the halloween thing was in the morning so there were no bugs but for the jazz when it was outside i mean people were everywhere like they tried to go under trees but like they spread out like somewhere on the playground area i don't think we could have literally covered the area with mosquito citronella we couldn't have covered an area that big and made it effective to kill all the bugs that like they were the size of pine birds you can ever kill all of them yeah yeah in that last 15 minutes of cleanup it was both my children mine like full ankles whatever it was exposed it's just covered in bites and we're like wow we didn't even plan it for that in mind but we definitely realized afterwards jazz was spring september september fall sorry yeah well yeah so anyway anybody else have anything in regards to the last event good bad suggestion do better next time it always makes me laugh that like this the separation of the you know like how sometimes you'll have like parties and like all the guys are on one side and all the girls are on one side it's like a seventh grade stockholm no one's in seventh grade um but by the end like it started you know we didn't have that huge gap down the middle it started filling in and that was good to fairness everyone was trying to leave like an exit walkway and yeah which is good set their chairs right directly in front of anybody else so i think there was a lot of just shuffling against the wall so they're not blocking anyone yeah no and that was but then when that ran out people are like who cares right that's where we are okay so that was a good one and i think everybody enjoyed it we got some good feedback so thank you everybody for your your hard work and your time and attention um numbers um item number seven is the preparation for the thank you cards for beach cleanups that should be slash volunteers so we talked about this a while ago and we were kind of hoping to have like a i don't know a pizza party something i guess it's just not in the budget so um we do have like chick-fil-a gift cards and um and i'm totally open for suggestions but this is kind of what kyle and i came up with as an alternative to this was we um type up a thank you letter from the city on city letterhead you know obviously it has to get approved by everybody and then um like for beach cleanup for our events like you know there are people that are at everything they volunteer for every single thing um and we're just gonna send them a little thank you card in the mail with a gift card and um instead of the event at our one year beach cleanup like kind of anniversary date so we kind of talked about doing that what do you guys think of that i think it's great yeah yeah i think it's a great idea okay so what i'll do in the middle before our next meeting in june i wasn't gonna have a meeting in june because we really don't have an event until the fall but because we're having new people and they're getting voted in in june i would like to have a meeting in june so i put some dates and we'll do these letters then so we'll get a rough draft and i'll have kai kyle email it out to everybody so you know if you guys want to tweak something or if you have any suggestions you can get it back and we can have a final draft and then we'll go through and we'll um see how many gift cards we have and then like we have all the lists from the events you have to sign the waivers and then we obviously know who volunteered at all the events who took the tables who helped us set up and tear down and all that good stuff so we we pretty much have a good list of the people we just need to get addresses so i'll figure out the best way to do that with kyle in the middle and then i would like for each of us to sign those and then um hand address them and then kyle can mail those for us if that's okay with everybody so we'll take a little time at our next meeting because i think it's just a nice touch i know it's like a you know a type written letter but it's always nicer when you actually have some real signatures on on the papers it's not going to be 100 people it's probably going to be 20 25. did we have to buy those or did chick-fil-a donate neither so where we got the initial stack of gift cards is so when we joined keep pinellas beautiful they were in their so they are actually for the volunteers anyway so like i'm gonna count and see how many we have from them and then we'll we're gonna compare it to the list we have with people that should get a thank you and see where we are and hopefully we're not too short i mean it's the stack's like that high so if you don't give them oh so if we need more of this we can call them so no we didn't pay for that okay so we do have a relationship with them and we can say well you don't have a relationship but if you call them they'll they're pretty good about giving those cards away okay good to know how much are the cards you say they're five dollars or something or a sandwich or something yes maybe i can get the second one free some months they say yeah it's just something it's nice to show that we appreciate their time and you know coming and help support everything so um we will get something together and then you guys will get it on your email probably i'll give you two weeks i mean it's not gonna be a big deal so but you'll have time to do it if you're tied up and then obviously if you think of anything else in regards to that you can email kyle in the middle before you get it item number eight so update on the status of fall events for city council approval okay so um at oh the luncheon that we had the thank you luncheon that we were all at um dave gaddis our new mayor is like i would really like to have a chili cook-off so um what i'm proposing to you guys is because it's something that we're going to sell tickets for it's going to be a daytime event so most of what we do should be covered like from ticket sales like it won't really come out of our budget but the thing it's a good problem is that because of covid and everybody pushed the weddings off till now there's not a lot of days open left where we can have events even like our halloween event we can't have that on the saturday morning of halloween again because there's a wedding we have to have it on sunday in the afternoon so a couple of options that we could consider and this is i'm just going to throw this out and then you guys let me know what you think um we could we talked about sunset social which is another like big event where we're selling tickets and all that and i don't know if we want to do two of those like two months in a row we take that one off and then instead of doing jazz on that day because that's the day we have open and we've already got that day reserved we have the chili cook-off on in december which is kind of a nice time to have a chili cookoff on that saturday so on the 20 i believe it's the 29th of um november we were supposed to have jazz from like 4 30 to 7 30 or something like four to seven but instead we would have the chili cook off from like 12 to two was set up at 11 am so there's a couple of options that we have the thing with the chili cook-off is even ticket sales but if we don't sell a lot of tickets or you know we can't we really don't know where it's going to land we want to for you know you get a ticket for 10 bucks that gets you in with your samples of chili which people who sign up will you know obviously make and provide and then you get two drink tickets so we're going to have beer and wine the beer and the wine and insurance are more expensive than the band for jazz so that's why i thought we kind of flip out one for the other because we don't know how many you know tickets we're gonna sell and if we sell them ten dollars in advance and twelve dollars at the door it just depends on how many people that we have and we don't know how many that will be so um what i turned into kyle just so he could kind of look at the numbers was i it would be halloween and then it would be the chili cook-off and then it would be the christmas event and those would be our three fall events because i won the monies the same and two we're not trying to sell tickets to two things in the same time frame if that makes sense when is the potential chili cook-off november 1. or december no no it's november because it's the same day that jazz so i'm sorry it's the 19th we have the room reserved november 19th so there's no wedding because that's a thing i would say we could have all of it but we can't because there's not another open day we would have to do it like next year so i'm going to take a big breath right now i've been talking a lot and you guys can let me know what you think because that was a lot to throw at you but like the chili cook-off was kind of mixed because of um couldn't you know we needed to figure out how to get a liability around like eating chili i guess um yeah we were talking about that it cannot be cooked on property is that what no like has to be well they're just gonna like if they buy the ticket that's basically signing their liability that like the chili's going to be made at nora kodak's house and she's going to bring it in and if she's a really bad cook and you get sick it's on you there will be a skull and bone sign in front of my chili might be hot but that but anyway like we're like kyle when we were initially looking into it we didn't really see a way to get around it you know like bel air has a big chili cook-off every year but it's done through their community foundation but then dave talked to lynn and like if we do a liability like we do with the beach cleanup that kind of like you know you're buying this ticket and if it doesn't taste good to you don't eat it so maybe just do a must buy tickets in advance are you scared about that no i'm not scared about that i just thought i don't want somebody to not be able to come if they thought they were going to be out of town that weekend that ends up they can come you know i don't think we'll get a ton of people last minute because obviously we need to say you know we have 30 people making chili we have you know but that one i think we really do have to have indoors because for chili cook-offs you need electricity you need to plug in your crock-pots you've got crackers that are going to stale in two seconds if you have it outside so i think it would be better if we kind of set it up a little bit like the health and wellness fair but we wouldn't have all the tables in the middle we would actually have tape round tables where people could sit and eat and the perimeter would be like just you know a big view of crock pots and then like say i'm entering the chili cook off and i have a white chicken chili recipe and with it i really like to serve you know jalapenos and avocado yeah avocado or fritos i mean whatever people serve you know different things with their chilis like everybody brings their own condiments what we would provide are napkins and plastic spoons and we're not giving big bowls because obviously people would have to make a ton of chili we're giving like the little two or three ounce tasting cups where you get like two or three bites of each chili and so like when you get your you know when you walk in the door you get your stack of you know tasting cups or whatever two or three ounces whatever we find but that one we definitely have to have indoors and then we could have music um just piping through and like the table set up in the middle like i said it should be pretty easy breezy and it's lunch so it's like you know they still they can come in grab some lunch have a beer and we can set up something outside too you know the chili all obviously inside but i think the weather's going to be really nice for that yeah mid-november you know to go outside and everyone can shitty chat outside yeah maybe have a music outdoors put some tables out there you know that tail there's no way we could put tables and chairs outside we could definitely put we could probably do you know how many tables fit on that outdoor maybe six probably yeah we could do half an hour we could do some inside tables for people who want ac and we could do some outdoor tables for people who would want to sit up seems like a large power requirement everybody has a plug in this place yeah i've had them at my house with 100 people that's really not that big of a deal we just have to keep them away from the walls because like my walls were kind of this color and like chili splashed all over the back of the walls so we literally had to paint when it was over how many people participating in europe probably 20. so there's 20 crockpots there was no surge no power surge they're kind of like i mean they're crackles they're real like low they don't yeah yeah so the only thing that you what i did was the power strips so it's like there would be on a six foot table you would have two people one at each end you know the line down the middle saying this is chilly and we would reuse you know how we got the stands like with the wedding with the numbers on the table we would reuse those to say this is chili number one chili number two chili number three and then everybody would have dave suggested that i like this when they get their drink tickets they get a couple of tickets for there were like three categories that they liked just say best overall chili best chili with beans yeah whatever they were and then like every station has like a mason jar or something and then you literally put your ticket in the jar then all we're doing is counting tickets so like this and then we're going to get they're going to get a grow fee i did it for like one of my jobs like i made like with the cricket they we spray painted a skillet like a cast iron skillet and then put like chili cook off and then like the date and then who won and then every year and they haven't asked me to redo it but so maybe they don't have it anymore but it was like really cool and i think another good thing too which will help because like we don't know like what people can eat and what they can eat is if we have like the recipes there yeah descriptions like have them there so like if someone really likes it one they'll know what's in it to like oh i want that recipe oh well here you go instead of like oh i'll email you and then it's like a whole cluster so i think it would be just cool because it's like oh you're getting this too like if you really like something that you can add to your recipe yeah that's a great idea this would help too yeah people that have like so yeah we should make that like a requirement that they have to like just supply like how they make it like the recipe and then just like the ingredients which would be on there yeah that's perfect that's a great idea it just kind of kills two birds with one stone and then makes everyone happy there's some top secret chili recipes out there though well then don't join the chili cooker yeah well you can still have the list of ingredients so is everybody cool with that if we flip out jazz for the chili cookoff on the same day and then just so we'll have halloween in october as planned we'll have chili cook-off in november in lieu of jazz and then we'll have our christmas yeah as planned so the ten dollar cost that's um does that include the drink tickets that is for the drink tickets because yeah because like i'm paying for the chili like the individual right yeah yeah so the committee has to pay for the drinks no the committee has to pay for like insurance plates entertainment and then we are covering whatever is not purchased already on the tickets the budget was about the same but we as jazz but for jazz we weren't selling tickets for the chili cook if we are selling tickets so hopefully it's a we make some money but if we don't we at least cover a lot of the cost but if we don't we still have it in the budget to as a little extra cush um and then if we have money left over we could you know we talked about doing a few little bit nicer things for the christmas um so we could take a look at it after the event but yeah but it was pretty much right in line with what jazz would cost but we weren't selling tickets like i said so it's just the insurance and all of that is very pricey for like three hours and then obviously we still have to have security and you know all that good stuff like we always do why did we pick um november 19th we took that months ago because it was open okay yeah i think because if it's an indoor event we could do it any day of the year no but the indoor event we have to have it on the weekend and the weekends are all booked with weddings gotcha yeah so that's our big like so for like next year's events like we need to get ourselves organized like we could even you know do it in the next couple of months and say you know these are the events that we're requesting um yeah you need to do that because we're resting this place more and more yeah they're filling up which is great but we just need to get our day i mean it's not like we're having one every even month even let alone every week it's just we need to if we're gonna have like one spring and three in the fall we need to get our four dates to kyle who gets them to laura and gets us on the books it's november 19th is saturday or sunday this is saturday it's a saturday mm-hmm saturday before thanksgiving so i was just gonna ask it's right around thanksgiving so and we could talk about this more i just wanted to make sure that you guys were i want to get your input and i wanted to see what you thought because we could very easily keep you know the event in september but then that's just a lot for september october november december it's a ton of work and just to sell the tickets i think it's again it's new we haven't done it before and i would i think it sounds fun it's totally different and of course filler has their wine walks so they have a couple a year at least two a year i'm aware of the wine walks so there's already something locally that does that i think it's it sounds very fun okay we've never had liquor at any of our events before this is again a trial run so that's the other thing so the selling of the tickets and alcohol at an event i think it's going to be a non-issue i mean it's very low key group i don't think it's going to be any different really than what we've been doing so far because people have been you know bringing their own beverages low-key whatever so what are we doing bare wood beer and wine beer and yeah will it be restricted to baylor beach residents only or how i don't think you could do that yeah definitely we've never restricted it to bellar beach residents only we've never had a problem and it's great if people have friends visiting and they want to bring them it's good yeah so are we limiting like you get two tickets per person to kind of reduce that at risk we haven't really talked about that so like if we are gonna have a cash bar after the two tickets i don't know we didn't really get you could do that yeah you have to get a state license special event license and you have to get it to look insurance which we have to do that anyway we have to do that to give them the two drinks that come with their ticket so yeah i mean hopefully we're going to encourage people to walk right to the event i mean something out about uber you know yeah and um most people are very responsible i mean we haven't had anybody do anything yeah most people can walk here right yeah and especially if we have a lot left over like you know obviously we're going to gauge it towards ticket sales you know we sold this many tickets we kind of know based on that how many glasses of wine slash beer you know so if we have a lot left over i definitely think that we should continue to sell it if if we can so george be really mad if we cut him off with two beers not 21. and then there's that so um okay all right so everyone's good with that all right cool thank you um and then number nine the review of sponsorship agreement and sponsorship levels that's still i know we just got a new city attorney so like we're still waiting i think the part that we put together which is this page is good i think we're waiting for the three-page contract to be reduced to a one-page contract you didn't get that no it's it's in draft right now oh okay so it should have been in your bag oh maybe it is now it's too busy yeah okay so is this done so when you say it's pretty much it's done the only issue you have with this and that's one of my reasons for coming recognition on the bellar beach sign yeah we pretty much told everyone that we weren't going to put any advertising on the side so the constant does not want you to recognize a business on that side we can advertise our events but not like let's say you've got a sponsor we'll say cody's they don't want that put on there okay what about the website and that was the only thing that they brought up the sign the sign and that was mainly because of the sign created some controversy with some people and at the time the council pretty much said we're not going to sell advertising on it and that's what they construe as being an advertisement even if it's sponsorship okay so we just have to take off number four yeah everything else that we're fine with okay and then this is the two pages that he came up here okay do we need to do anything else with this or this just needs to be revised that needs to be revised and then you know if you don't have any questions about it i know the console looked at it last night they didn't really have any questions yeah i don't have any questions i mean i didn't have any questions before when it was three pages we kind of took all the i'll call it godly duke out of the sponsorship agreement yeah no that's great i'm sorry i didn't see this that's great i can tell you where i was before arsenal went i remember you saying that it didn't happen but actively solicit those sponsorships or just people come to us we well that's an option you have i i know tammy's talking about doing a foundation but that hasn't gotten any so far but the consoles authorize the city attorney to draft some documents once they kind of get situated because there's a lot of steps you got to do to get that yeah for sure so i think what we talked about because we've always had it on the city website if you're interested in sponsoring one of our events please contact me my phone number is all over it's not like anybody's calling um so what kyle and i talked about doing once now now that this is done we're gonna send it to duke energy we're gonna send it to um waste management we're gonna send it to people that the city like pays and contracts out to do i'm sure there's more like maybe like the construction companies who are doing the um before we start knocking on like we've said it over and over we're not fundraisers we're not going to be knocking on businesses doors like in bel air bluffs or whatever trying to get them to sponsor our events especially because for a while there was like you know oh i we don't want you know non-bellar beach residents here i would never ask people for money and then tell them their citizens couldn't come to our events but we don't have the parking to say hey everyone's invited we don't have the infrastructure for that so i think that like our our initial conversation was we're going to start with the people that already have money in their marketing budgets to sponsor some of these things and that we already do business with and see if we if we get any like interest there and then you know if if we do great if we don't we have to look at next steps maybe look at people within bella beach that own businesses but there's really no way for us to know unless you know they live around you and you know they own a business like there's no way for us to send out a letter or you know it's just the stuff that we already talked about maybe we could put it on the sign because we haven't put that on a sign uh can we can we ask for sponsorships on the sign but then not put them on you're not asking for you know i don't see one not advertising yeah yeah the the difference i will tell you until you have a foundation duke's not going to give you anything so i've already broached that assumption oh okay you might get some money from people like waste management different scenario companies that have big contracts you know uh unfortunately the sheriff doesn't do it but he's got a contract but you can get stuff from businesses we deal with but duke's one of them that won't do unless you're a 501c3 okay now that's good to know um well we do have our first meeting on that on monday so i don't know hopefully we get going but yeah there's a lot of steps you got to get your bylaws have a bank account submit to the irs and get approval yep there's any way i can help that's my background this finance so yeah you're more than welcome to come to our first meeting on monday i'm happy to help anyway i can't that's my background i've been in finance a long time okay that's great mba yeah um we don't have to do it today but i would really like to replace that item number four with something else like if someone's gonna give us 1500 and sponsor our entire event maybe just we don't have to brainstorm today um but like if if you read this and maybe if like in your past you've worked with the like maybe somewhere else that you've lived or you've seen but i probably looked at like 10 or 12 cities when i put this together and a lot of them are so much bigger than us that it's like oh you get your private tent or you get all the free booze that you want well you know we can maybe do that if we're we if we have alcohol but when we put this together like the alcohol thing hadn't even come up yet it was always a no we don't think we're doing it so um all the like free parking like that you know the stuff that we're up we're gonna give them no matter what like like i think i'm referring to largo right now because that was free parking passes and a tent a private vip tent like none of that stuff really works for us so um i'd like to think of something else maybe maybe they'll let us put they won't let us put a sign there but maybe they would let us put a sign like up between the two polls like we did for jazz we did a big sign with the sponsor on it i i just think if they're giving us money and they're supporting our event that they should that's why they're doing it they want their logo out there that sign was like 200 oh yeah and yeah that came with an arbitrary because it would still have the event name time it wouldn't just be their info it would be our event info and then their logo it would be sponsored by with their logo so it wouldn't be like all 100 them so like like i said we did the jazz sign and it was just what we are these the did tiers like i mean like what you looked at from the other cities are these the same pricing to yours you mean the 1500 750 oh no some of theirs were like ten thousand twenty thousand dollars do you think it really hurts if we just take one thing off no oh i don't know i mean come up with something i guess because that's what i was saying like if you know 1500 they're getting all these things but then if they do it for another city and it's five thousand they get one more thing we're kind of like more compelling because it's less money but more like i don't know yeah i think that more citizens yeah that's the difference they're reaching like 10 000 people not 100 or 200 or whatever our events are so that's the biggest difference because most of the time if it's not somebody that has a big contract with our city and that's why they're doing it because they're hitting all the residents like waste management they hit all of our residents anyway um i think that's the biggest difference is you know if it's a if it's an individual company they look at the number of people that are going to be in attendance just kind of like the food trucks so i was trying to think of a way to get their name out there even to people that aren't seeing or aren't coming to the event i don't mind the 200 out of the 1500 that they're putting in for the banner yeah i mean we've done the banners in the past i think um and it'll also bring more attention to the event i think it's just well spent it says your logo on printed signs already so that's kind of already on there but like this is a different banner yeah what's those stakes that you're referring to so that thing sounds like more like you're on like a single which board that might sit right outside where you're coming in and list all the sponsors that kind of thing i guess we're talking about one more like a big one that goes between those two poles in the front yeah we might need to be specific on the logo and the printed signs on what that means so you'd say maybe you know three 18 by 18 or whatever we're doing 24 by 24 i don't know but those things we usually do four so or four of them whatever it is maybe we can just be specific there and then um the banner because someone's sponsoring it i hope a lot of people come okay so i don't oh that's good on there for 200 bucks especially the team that's coming and it's just coming out of our budget okay no i like that is everybody good with that be your best form of advertising yeah i mean every day people going back and forth and i've seen tons of walkers taking pictures yeah so that's good yeah that's great i think the banner's most noticeable sadly out of everything out of the digital write-up out of the yard stakes out of yeah well at the time we had the jazz banner people were complaining but i think maybe we're okay now what happened people complained that we had that sign on the front of the building but i think we're okay now right yeah i think we should be okay so all right yay i'm so glad that's done um okay and then item number 10 just the proposed dates and times for our june meeting you don't have to tell me now you can email paddy um like you know in the next week or so or she'll have her send out an email and you can respond back just just eyeballing this do i hit because i know like you guys have some you know work and whatever previous like family commitments i just want to make sure that like everyone can come to one of them i can probably make it either i work remotely from home okay that's great monday and wednesday are my working days so that's why i would pick the tuesday day i'm pushing for tuesdays well but would you like tuesday at two o'clock i didn't even notice that 5 30. yeah i do it doesn't matter tuesday at 2 o'clock is fine i was just i always prefer the earlier time this is scheduled to write during a non-set travel time that we have i just haven't finalized it um so how about tuesday june 21st at 2 o'clock is everybody good with that [Music] does anybody have anything else that they'd like to add because if not um we could make it a motion to adjourn that's my job we did yeah we did have some conversation at our workshop just to let you guys know there's no decisions to be done but we talked about am i knocking on doors around the city there was more than several people that really thought it was pretty cool to live in bel air beach and they'd like to see the christmas decorations kind of step up a little bit in comparison i mean everybody just they said you know i drive down this street and i see these towns and they have this and that and this and that and so that's what they were just basically providing information on that and through that conversation that we had at the workshop it actually segued into the sponsorships like with duke so i think it would be that the sooner that we can get that other issue taken care of that would be awesome because that would be something because of duke's expertise with the power requirements if we get some lit christmas decorations and things like that uh of course it would you know we put something up to say this was paid for by duke energy something to that effect but that that seems like that's the one of the bigger challenges with providing christmas decorations that have the ability to be lit yeah you know in the evening stuff like that so if dude could take a swing at that and do that no issue and lynn was telling us that we do have some of the poles that currently have electrical power to them oh just not all of them so that that might be something just tossing it out there that's one of those largo does a beautiful job of it largo and indian rock speech both have freight businesses separation rocks beach use solar i mean that's an option are they plugged in i think they're plugged in they're plugged into indian rocks yeah i thought they were and we need to crush those towns [Music] yeah no i'll definitely bring that up at the other meeting okay because it has to go through the foundation the other reason is it's tax deductible i don't know if you guys like ever made a donation of something like a you know a fundraiser online or whatever if they're not a 501c you can't deduct it up for taxes right so we definitely want to make sure that it's 51c it is we have the application we're set everything that he mentioned is already under control so yeah it's just a matter of um getting everything kind of lined up and so hopefully like we don't have an event until the fall so it's a perfect time to try to get that up and going because we don't have a ton of other things that we're trying to juggle so works good but yeah the christmas thing would be great and i didn't know that about duke energy so that's yeah that would be good that would be wrong in the meeting i guess the city relatively recently just acquired new new non-electrical christmas banners probably that hang on the polls and stuff like i'm sure they're very nice i don't recall well they had they bought those ones a couple years ago that are about this size they're red and green and merry christmas yeah they're very they're very small they're like little flags front yard it's like this big you can't really see them the thing is i mean we could residents can donate right so like around it was memorial day or one of the veterans day some loving went through the whole town it's not that big putting up the little flags yeah i thought that was wonderfully amazing holiday it's like great yeah patriotism is like it was i'm like that's why i'm glad i live in bellar beach and so i mean if people want to do that before we have anything up and running is that what that bottom one is the income sponsor something like a uh-huh yeah no so that's great so we'll definitely bring that up so did we decide on june 21st 2pm yeah you were checking your schedule yeah are you good okay yeah we are waiting for you george everything moves slowly no you're good we just want to make sure may i have a second all right all in favor hi hi all right good night everyone thank you"
