    "transcript": "okay we are calling to order this meeting of the parks and rec committee on June 20th 2024 de will um Michael will you do the roll call uh yes thank you hey good good good morning everyone all right uh P I hear you uh John here uh de I'm here um K I heard you yes Aon yes sir all right and I think that coverage unless we have any guests nope all right great okay so the first order number one is the approval of the agenda today's agenda do I have a motion I'll Mo I'll move a second second all right and so approved number two is the approval of the minutes from May 14th 20124 they looked good second oh okay okay so they are approved was that was both of those Deb and John yep okay thank you sorry um we don't have any citizens here we may get one in but she didn't know if she' make it or not but so number four is the discussion of the Morgan Park murial so I'm very sad to say that it didn't do do what I wanted it to do on Monday night but John dropped off sketches to Kyle to take to the council and they looked at them but they didn't do anything with them cuz it wasn't on the agenda cuz it was a special meeting so you couldn't add anything or whatever but anyway um I I know it's beautiful pictures that will all probably agree on I'm kind of confused about the squares in those pictures oh those those are vents I'm like what are those things yes mhm and we're looking at pictures Michael there I'll try I'll text you okay okay great I tried that to you and it didn't work John sent these to me but only the first page is that all we have no okay yeah I got both of them too and then this is some that he sent a long time ago no that are the bathroom walls they don't pop they don't pop I would like them see that's what I like I like the blue you like them mhm I love the blue one I'm color blind so maybe that's why I can't tell I can't tell the see it yeah but maybe too subtle can I see it oh yeah little arms I like how we got b beach in there with the turtle though I didn't think it was going to fit well but that all that is to scale so I mean this is pretty but it's a lot of blue like don't you want any green trees or you want more Blue Pump trees again I like the subtlety but because it's going to be blue on the other two sides with all the ocean see the blue obervation I just like the drawing I like where it's just simple trees okay let me go back to this but I'm just one V so or one opinion so nobody wanted they weren't too happy because we didn't go the extra we didn't get it to them or they didn't know about it it wasn't on the agenda and this is a special meeting so they can't have other business am I saying that that's correct yeah let's call it for a specific purpose right so you can't add it now they did look at them correct I gave them to your husband I don't I didn't witness them looking at them oh okay cuz I here's a question I have and cuz I'm I've done Sunshine meetings and all you know can I call Dave and say is this okay or did you want to actually approve it well I want it I want it in the meeting you what I want it to be in a meeting you do want it to be in so we have to wait till July yeah I know it's just gets so hot and he's going to be out there that's what I I mean you know he he was supposed to he misunderstood he didn't realize it was for that Monday he thought it was this emergency meeting I don't know why he thought that he didn't even know about it at that time yeah so he just kind I was like John why didn't you send these things so um I do have comments on both um of course good but I don't love them I kind of would like a little bit of a happier turtle and I would like maybe a little bit more stuff coming on this side too just at least tapering off I just feel like it's slightly off-balanced I could be a merman mer I think that would look good I Vito any myr people and I don't know about his little being there I've not seen any my people out there other than my granddaughter he's pretty though what are we what are we paying for the whole three sides well that's the other questions I have to Kyle um you know he never gave us a specific price he knows about the 2500 yeah that's what we have in that we were not using for events that could be used towards this okay so oh you just made a statement that confused me a little bit cuz I thought 25 was all we had and I know we decided did um last month to do the chili in the fall the chili cook off in the yeah that'll be a new budget year oh it is yes why the fall is coming up before that though we October 1 we said it after we said oh October 1 is the new budget year October 27th is what we set it for yeah okay you're setting it after where after yeah good because I'd like to be here okay yeah it and it'll be a new budget is what so the new budget so we could use all 25 for this because I was yeah if you're not doing another event you have 25 and now if it costs more and it's something that you that you guys and the council really wants then we might be a to work something out but well I was going to ask him what can you do for 15 you know um cuz I thought we might need he originally said one wall was 15 I thought he said 4,000 to do all three and I thought he said the two with 3,000 and then he said when he heard we had 25 I'll work with you okay well I wasn't you know here for that conversation so if he'll do all that for 2500 bucks then I think we just yeah we did jump on all all three walls you're talking about for 25 all three walls for that doing that for 25 however if we're paying for it ourselves why do we have to go through city council or can he start can he start prepping the walls or something because this is not what the money was put in the budget for this is okay I see so I guess what I'm asking what do we as Parks and Rec need to do at this point to get this started ASAP it needs to be put on the agenda for July yeah okay and that's that's all we can do at this point yes we should should we start with just didn't get it to us should we take a I mean you want to call the question you know it's like does the Parks and Rec committee recommends that for $2500 uh we have all three walls done essentially in accordance with these with with the schematic and the pictures he's done vote with amongst us right now right so then we take that to the city council yeah make that okay so do you want to make a motion to vote on this yes do you want to the motion I don't I will make the motion that parks and wreck should move forward with using John coma to paint the three walls and hopefully do it within the $2500 price range no I think he said 2500 bucks didn't he that's what she said well you said hopefully he didn't say 100% so I'm I make the motion to move forward and that we'd like to present this to County so a second you want to say approximately 2500 bucks they're going to be interested in you know they want to know the money why you know you know yes approximately $2500 do I have a second John second thank you De John okay I thought Patty had already seconded and then there was further discussion oh sound yeah sure um so uh Deb's made a a motion um to move forward with John comr for the the painting of the three walls for approximately $2,500 and present that to council and it was seconded by Patty okay that's perfect excellent any discussion after that well my discussion is have we picked or do we let Council pick they don't just show them options and what you pick how much be how it's going to be paid for this is let them yeah this is the Gest of what we're doing it doesn't have to be identical right now you can put it on the screen yeah for them to see in in larger than life kind of thing okay a that was a good idea okay will you do that yeah he just said yes you as can you do it take those well you already actually told me can I do everything I know you do all right so number four we're finished any more discussion on mural okay wait I do have a discussion everybody in favor of that recommendation oh oh yeah everybody in favor of the your motion I I I I okay I kind about that part we didn't do that for any of them on the appr the motion thing yeah oh we had all the eyes afterwards all right so number five discussion of recreational activ ities okay I asked U Renee to put this on here because I was trying to think of more fun things we could do because I know when Tammy was here and then when she left she was saying that um the bcff B BBC okay anyway your thing um was going to try to take over more activities that some of the activities that parks and wck was doing because it seemed more like it fit better in that aspect and um I kind of like that so that we can be more Park and more wreck Park and wreck not fundraisers or parties or whatever so the park we have pretty I think pretty down pack cuz we do the surveys and we are recommending like the flowers in the median or just beautification of all our Parks but Recreation and uh Kim Shaw Elliot had an idea and I had an idea so um Kim's idea which I did not print out and I should have was to have a monthly Back Porch Sitting is what she called it and that's out here on the back just a gathering kind of like when we do the um Beach clean up Back Porch Sitting everybody brings their own thing but it's just Neighbors coming in to meet Neighbors um bring your own um everything yes bring your own everything um no alcoholic beverages of course games we could do cornhole and um you know board games and things like that but it's more about getting to know your neighbors she said she surveyed her neighborhood and they liked it the people with young kids were glad because they might meet more young kids in the neighborhood cuz we don't do a lot of young kid activities and and the more mature people said um they liked it cuz they like to get out and walk and meet neighbors and things like that so she was going to present it I think just to the council but then she was trying to think this might be a better venue to go through the parks and rep committee so I think it's a great idea Readington Shores does it they do a oh do they they do well they do a yearly City picnic everybody okay and it's very successful I kind of thought monthly might be too often but it SS like a community picnic which is okay which is you know but she wants to do it monthly monthly monthly that's a lot yeah that's what I thought I thought maybe quarterly because you want it's all about meeting people meeting getting it's very casual I wasn't certain about the logistics if she came through us does that mean one of us needs to be there every time um does kle need to be here cuz the bathrooms would certainly have to be unlocked no bathrooms well I don't need to be here I I'll just give you somebody else okay a code or something um so you know Logistics I wasn't too certain about yet let me see if I can pull her thing up um but that anyway that's something for us to think about for a few minutes that's one activity I was trying to come up with something else too again recreational like a pickleball tournament a very casual pickleball tournament none of these Pros out there you'd be better off with a cornhole tournament well that's what I'm saying that's what I'm doing REM you can remove the nets for a day and you could ask I have two sets you could ask people to bring their cornhole sets and do a cornhole turn tournament you could do both yeah well you only have two courts you only have two Courts for pickle bow so you want to be really careful asking pickle ball players to come and play in a tournament because you're going to end up with like 50 people that's okay okay a big mix of skill sets too right yeah they'll come from everywhere again this is just something to get people to know each other better again some an activity for us to do um it could be like okay let's have another picnic or something in aot threatening than pickle ball what's more threatening less cornhole is a lot less threatening than pickle ball I mean because you're going to wind up with a very you only got two courts and you and you got you're going to have a wide range of skill sets so have two players you'll have single players well that's again that's something we would have to set up ahead of time we could have singles over here and doubles over here if we have two courts we could do um I got to set up around Robin or something limit how many cuz it would take forever if you had too many teams right we'd have to limit it to you know I don't know how many teams but again it's again just trying to think of recreational activity so that's why I put it on here so hopefully we come up with more like just came up the activity perfect a what cornhall is the perfect picnic activity I mean it's like who runs around bragging about how good they are cornhole well my kids do I live with three boys so well I don't anymore but you know what I mean so anything else besides cornhole that y'all could think of that might be if you ever brought music out there that would oh would always had music why don't we just do once a month neighbors meet somewhere like we could meet at whoever wants to go go we'll put in the newsletter hey Belair people if you want to get together let's meet over at Bell Visto or whatever the Wine Place is tonight and or you know on Thursday this date once a month I don't know John but where nobody's in charge of it if people want to go we just put it in the newsletter hey neighbors if you want to get together and meet other neighbors uh we're going to arrange a little meet and greet over at such and such coffee shop or over at someone's house I don't know we could alternate it it could be once a quarter I don't really care I'm just thr out ideas that's what I want I I just think from uh if if you want to get an activity going but just my opinion all right you have kind of a set time so people can fit it into their schedule people that do stuff are busy that's the thing people don't want to do anything don't make any difference that's correct so you know if you say the first you know the first Saturday of every month we do Beach cleanup at this time it plan for it oh I know I'm doing I I planed you know that's so if we want to set up a routine which I think would be the hope for outcome anything else else would mean that at the end of the day the event turned out to be a dud you know yeah I me we can always do one and see how it goes if we don't get it turn out we don't do another we don't say it's monthly we say this month we're trying something new yes I like that yeah or next month we're going to try something new we could start with the porch thing because it doesn't have to be here every time but it could be and you know what might be nice some monthly activity is what you're saying yeah just something just some nebor monthly neighbor Gathering and again we could turn one of those monthly Gatherings into the Fruit Stand thing you know it's still they can vary it doesn't have to be the same thing each month say it's inaugural and after you see the turnout decide exactly what you want to do with the second one I guess you know it's a launch I can get this to open to commit to once a month right off the bat scams you I just think we say hey we're going to try something new I just hit the wrong side okay I'm going to read Kims and see if that yeah okay I invite you to consider a new costree activity for our community we can invite citizens to meet once a month on the back porch of our beautiful Community Center I see this as a drop by leave when you want come when you can typ or gathering it's an opportunity for Neighbors to meet in a completely casual way with no commitments I have tested this concept with several of my neighbors and they responded with high enthusiasm some responded that as parents of young children they've been looking for a way to meet up their parents and their children others simply welcome an opportunity to meet new people enjoy good conversation following is an initial notice since we are already well Into Summer and this requires no prep or funding I suggest that we begin ASAP and have our first event in July and she has a little um por sitting you know whatever I guess that so she do her little flyer biller what would go on the thing okay um join your neighbors for some oldfashioned Port sitting enjoy good conversation board games yard games or some deep breaths while taking in the natural beauty seen from the rear teres of our community center all are welcome men women children come and go as you wish bring whatever you would like to enjoy on your own or share chairs games Refreshments Etc restrooms will be open perfect so and another thing we can do is maybe just maybe one evening we could have everyone go see sunset at Morgan Park you know anybody who wants to get together and instead of doing Porch Sitting this month let's go and watch a sunset together and that could be we could alternate one month here one month there I like that yeah and one month could be your cornhole thing corle yeah I mean that to me that's more like a Saturday afternoon Thing Once the Night Comes my husband will not be outdoors in Florida he's like he's got to go in because of the no seeum get him so you know we're not coming out at night time stuff they can be can you send that to me as well yes sir yeah okay thanks do you want to text me or how do you have that uh a text is fine yeah I'm trying to figure out um Patty's end I think she should probably email it to you and Renee okay that no that works that works and have have Rene send it to us and then what was your what was the the young lady's name who put that together Patty cim sha Elliot she's one of our board members k i m and then s h a w hyphen Elliot e l l i o t okay perfect thank you mhm I need this to Ford why is it not foring there we go to Kyle you are and to Michael Michael's not in my list just Renee to Renee yeah he shouldn't be in yourist he could be in my email list H know um what is Renee there she is never mind it came up all right okay since make sure you got it cuz I'm not real good at you know 10 pop up right here I'll let you know okay um so we'll change it instead of just for sitting monthly activity and the first one will be out here yeah anybody want to make a motion on that I'm make the motion motion on a monthly activity some type and I also think I feel like it doesn't necessarily have to be monthly like we could aim for that but let's get our SE legs on first before we commit to monthly I mean that would be my idea but let's start it let's I call it periodic or or well no I think it's I think it's relevant I mean I think it's relevant I don't think we've you know we can if it's an overwhelming stick with monthly for now and then we can change it right right we can always like we we cancel July Beach clean up because I'm no nobody's here to do it yeah nobody's here to do July are you here July 4th okay not it's not impossible I'm not here but I I'm planning on you're not here I'm not here de we canel we we it's in the minutes we canceled July in FA 4th holiday right okay so you made this motion Deb yes I did John did you second it too okay okay all in agreement I I I I okay the merchant number six is any anything else when recreational activities yes I have a question okay so do I understand this right then so the chili cook off is back on the agenda and it it's going to come after it's going to be late October or something like that yeah we've been waiting we've been making decisions based on football schedules and stuff okay right now in the last month meetings it was October 27th from 12: to 4: okay play cor oh good that's because I would like to time my return you know to do that if that's possible yeah we need your chili well I intend to win this year okay and TVs because we we talked about having the football games on that's yeah that's all on Kyle and Aaron when when is it

oh here's here's the beautiful one is the Community Foundation that's the beach towels no I oh so they have the beach towels and we and we also have beach towels but ours are not that expensive no no and yours are for sale and these are for donation these are about from here to the end of the table they're like I think they call them um bath like sheets bath sheets yeah bath sheets that's how big they are they're enormous but you can see how pretty the colors are make sure you like those colors before you buy them John very color okay I don't care about color what are you going to do with those bring them up we need to go back to number five because we agreed on this monthly activity but we did not choose a date Okay so real quick I just question does anyone have cornhole boards they have what cornhole boards in their possession I have I have two I believe two sets mhm I have one side if you need it and bags I I don't have it okay I do need some though for my front porch M you should go out buy one and give this is a good good excuse to get broken in you missed my birthday well I meanly 60 bucks I suppose you can spend as much as you want on them huh yeah you want to do it on a Thursday night maybe in the summer or are you wanting to do it on the weekend we got a board of adjustment hearing that night and that's it might be a little distracting no that's okay we'll choose I just choose to chose a random night so I have no tie to it cuz you're coming off the 4th of July you're going to have a lot of people away could do maybe the 25th of July unless you think it's too far out what are your thoughts Miss PTY looking so that July 25th well that's just me talking oh okay 25th is just the following Thursday which means nothing to me it could be a Friday could be any night I'm just Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday what's the 24th I have something on the 24th oh it's just somebody's birthday any any day better for the city hall I I don't I got nothing on the 25th at this point oh you want to start with that as a tentative date no let's make it the date if everyone's okay with it let's make it the date and we'll plan for it yeah well that's what I mean and this if something comes up and we can't get into city hall because they have something yeah he's checking the schedule right now I know but things come up okay tentative date July 25th okay and it said 7:00 p.m. on that flyer I believe when when do you guys want to firm that up on the 25th so we can at least put that on the reader board mhm well yeah I'm saying tentative date in my brain just because if some emergency comes up we can't we'd work around it unless there the Council on cuz it's really the only thing that involves the build inside is the bathrooms yeah and since Kim initiated this I expect her to be there M so and that doesn't have to be approved through the council or anything right okay no I mean cuz you guys do events that's pretty simple very simple I think we'll be fine um we have um oh we already did we send our June newslet we did early in the month we s June early got the newslet we could do like a blast um you know the week of or something try and get okay I think a blast would be good we can um were you thinking about being out there with an arrow on Saturday you know trolling an arrow around talk about yeah that's I'll do at least 12 hours okay good so he'll be out there with an arrow and like pointing oh yeah right here are you P City yeah just you know I got to be there Flappy guys too oh yeah whacky a playable G you cleaning up the beach then uh no it was can't very I don't know I was kidding about Kyle um standing on the corner holding an arrow oh trying to get people to go in might might intrig people be a little hot though yeah okay now do we need to work any on the chili thing like so we have our date and we were still okay so we have our weekend we didn't really firm up whether we wanted to do it on the Saturday or the Sunday I thought you did you looked up something I left it was an out of town gang for the box it was and it was somebody that a 1:00 game too yeah and it was somebody that a lot of the um snowbirds might like to come watch I can't remember was it like a Chicago probably the Bears I got to look at my Emil this 27th of October yes sir good um and we said you know we your favorite Jersey we did say all that are you going to have registration for the cook off again and charge prices and right that's what I said we need to talk about it now yeah yeah registration have a lot of information on last year 1:00 game versus versus the Falcons and you said um the Bucks are away mhm yes they're away and are they the ones playing the Falcons yes okay so that's a good one cuz there's probably a lot of Atlanta people here yeah that should be a good one what time and that's 1:00 1:00 Sunday October 27th sth and they playing who the Falcons Atlanta the Falcons huh FAL they'll win that one started at 12 starts at 12 no I said we could start at 12 yeah before the game you don't come in the midle well that's what we have we had 12 to four okay um last year it was $10 in advance and 12 at the door per person though mhm and it included two beverage tickets you said something about changing the beverage part I thought yes so I was I was going to simplify it so that we didn't have to sell it um that we just do the um so we just do the we don't do the pre-sale either okay because that got pretty confusing and no one El was really worth it I agree with you so maybe just make it $15 is your wait 15 could you relax $15 and it gets you two drinks your chili your day of chili and the two drinks where can you go for freaking $15 $15 I mean it's a gift what last year you could go for 12 and get two drinks and I don't know are you still paying the same price for eggs as you were last year I'm not I don't care make it 12 10's not enough we were charging for the drinks that we really don't get that many people we could probably with our budget afford to just give out drinks have people want to participate register and then make it free no I don't think you should make it free it's not a fundraiser though we don't want a fundraiser we want just we want people we just want people to come it's just it's just a recreational do it our make it okay so so we make it free this year or even $5 that makes a little you think about it you you think about coming oh $5 wow look what I'm getting for $5 and then it's not you know put it then put us in the hole we but we have a budget for events okay I mean I think the purpose is to get people there to get have an event there it's Community are the oriented are the um mhm people like John that are going to cook do they pay do they yeah I think they registered but that's part of like they're going to win something if they win like that's going to go into like a prize I and I don't have that written down that you think you think you know what I got last year I got two great Tommy Bahama chairs with the pillow and the pocket and I got up 40 bucks a piece wait let me tell you something the city council was supposed to not even be in there know two the slots were that's not true I'm not part of City Council and I'm sure they were yeah but gtis won for crying out loud I was I'm going to give him a lot of grief this year if he wins again but also got this out I don't drink beer Lord doesn't drink beer we got this giant michelo really metal cooler I Don't It Make hands Troublesome no I use it for water for that that was rules well he can't drink beer and I don't like it so I'm just saying when if it's a free event it simplifies it a lot okay and I again we don't it'd be awesome we had a lot of people it would be still people aren't going to come and just what we need to simplify is the grading the that we need to we need to get with somebody who's done one I mean I know the mayor has experience but we have to like have a good system I've never done a I've never participated one so oh you didn't last year yeah but we didn't do it right we didn't do it correctly that's what I'm saying we need to simplify the scoring system yes um what is that is that this deal this contest this but this is not the first time was that last time the first time it had been done did no no we did it the year before too right no only one really we skipped last year cuz it didn't come together so it went pretty good good you have you have so many you only have so many stations what what can you do 12 15 stations yeah we had too many last year too many chili too many chilies I think I versus how many people showed up yeah but we still want a lot of right we but we just need more people so I I really want to I mean if we have the budget and we didn't really throw a big event this year I think that's a good thing to start with a free thing and maybe we will get more people than we normally do and that will entice them to come to more things throughout the year that's right yeah so they're going to pay for their beverages all right you could even do Bo no because if you no I don't think you if you don't charge we don't need to get a license so that'll save us money right there m but we can limit it there you go like you can have six years with a judgment obviously if somebody is you know we can Li I mean one or two I could think of a few who are going to have six beers let them have six beers if they need that are you allowed to uh uh sell the pop and I assume we'd have beer with chili with we just have to do it all John it will have to be beer coolers no you could do instead of doing wine you could do the coolers you know like the neutal the TR the Tres because maybe we could get those donated from from the pts or something yeah so let's do that we could do beer coolers soda what you're calling pop and water four things done these come in vodka they come in different flavors they're all and you did say water didn't you yes ma'am okay and so can't live without it and so you're going to dessert 12 are you what are you have 12 stations and are you going to go out and we need to make some announcement to say sign up you know what I mean what if it's over subscribed first 12 whatever it is we can do more than 12 we can do more than 12 we can at least do 20 I have an idea 20 chili yeah too many that's too many to grad that's what I'm saying that's what was difficult last year people could not taste them all and comp I mean that one lady did it right she we need to find out how we're going to operate it though not everybody needs to vote we can have judges yeah you could have a panel of Judges let's do that like we did with the Halloween thing oh and since we're not doing the Halloween that way it won't be a popular panel of Judges yeah it won't be some deal where City Council Members yeah that kind of deal I'm just kidding strike that from the record yeah you're you're sour about it it's okay you lost but you had duck in yours didn't you or pheasant or duck no I had I had pheasant turkey and chicken it was five [Music] F WL foul J we could also we could also do a dessert contest so cornbread contest instead of maybe we should do chili and cornbread people BR they brought whatever they thought went with theirs well I'm just thinking instead of us paying for dessert there was a way of maybe having people bring the dessert I was thinking maybe we could yeah make it like you make something I'll make something John make something Kyle make something you want me making food publ makes good desserts go buy one or we can just pick it up right in here so we'll need desserts probably something with fruit what man this is come on we're watching a ball game with chili and stuff like this I no fruit brownies brownies I'd go over to uh I would go over to the Italian place down on gold Boulevard and I would get a bag yet is what I have with mine spaghetti dinner too huh we'll do spaghetti dinner I might do that okay you're right I agree with you it needs to be brownies or something something simple substantial yeah cookie brownies something simple to pick up pick up go yeah and I think if you if you know we'll get ships we'll get things that go with chili like yeah like the guacamole we did last year the people to eat chili is this what is this at the hospitality table or yeah this at the hospitality table or you Bu you're buying a beer or something like that you can have a little plate this is a city sponsored deal or what oh bartend I like that Ro okay we'll also have just some City Chili which will be pretty simple just a b oh I see yeah and you'll have like just not not as a competitor it be with some that you know Kyle that could also be at John's Hospitality oh he's in the thing the hospitality table Hospitality listen I'm a contender I'm a contender huh you I actually think you're going to win I don't know about that's remember your CH spread around easy I I don't know I'm not the Fant Hunt is after this deal so I'm not sure I can wait are you actually hunting going to be today oh oh okay time out it's all fresh everything fresh time out for a second wait yeah but just a second can we finish this deal here I'll wait yeah that's what we're finishing I'm trying to get you finish but I I have something to say about this subject here yes sir I think if we're going to have a contest that we need to define the number of slots so we can set up the room so we can have a first how should we put it whoever signs first come first first come first sir right all right let's do 15 people for now and we could change it how's that you how many we had last year do you remember how many we had last year uh without like so that's it was two years ago Tammy um kind of got she had two in there because she was trying to fill more right um if you guys are comfortable with 15 I I think that was we probably had just unsolicited just not parks and rack we only had 12 with the 12 how do you know because I was in it you were number 12 weren't you no was I was thinking 12 might be Listen by you by the time you put the tables in the middle you had the TVs up and you your hospital T that want everybody participating in the chili you want people to come and try all the chili that's right you looked in the mirror and said I have big bags that's all I said John say the magic number is 12 okay 12 I don't care 12 right and that that took care of the entire perimeter which enabled you to have tables in the middle so I don't think you can and I know I went home with with about a third of a pot you know I almost all my chili was gone as opposed to the winters I looked and I saw that I'm just kidding well I just threw a random number out to give us a base to work on so say 12 now okay chil was gone too it was good chili very good chili It's a good event because and we need to come up with prices too and categories remember last year the categories were the crowd favorite the most flavor F and creative I think that's so good I think that's so good yeah if have if we have a judging panel you can't have a crowd favorite cuz so we'll just make it favorite no CU that's kind of broad yeah um okay give me the other two words most flavorful which was spicy in parentheses and then creative that's what we creative fun we W was and then I got just I don't know how creative you could get with children like that's going to be like it's going to be the spicier and then well [Music] it's sorry how about a Best in Show or something like that all around like yeah yeah because that enables you that like the lady the ladies next to me I mean they just totally schooled me on the setup you know what I mean all the stuff that they had set up Oran I just show up I just showed up with my gym bag you know what I mean like here it is plop and I mean just I yeah people had their tablecloth on the flowers yeah no all that stuff I'm not going to do that but that that could be part of the best in show I think Best in Show overall show there you go that's the dog thing yeah well call it should be like a costume party you know best in best in elements overall best overall best there you go which you could take into consideration presentation yeah presentation taste comments and they were all equal as far it wasn't it wasn't like first place second place third place they were all equal they're all equal winners yeah so not necessarily getting the um they were just seen gifts either but right so we will say Best in Show or over whatever I said was the best overall best we would say is this gift once we know what it is most flavorable wins this gift of course once we have stuff donated what about what about let them pick which one they want oh that's true that's what you did last year last year we got it was actually cute it was just like each one was that chili spoon with the category so cool it hangs right in my kitchen oh is it it's so cute so you guys like that okay the chili spoon with but it's consistent and you have the year on it so if you have like a hundred of them really so then like what about like the prizes like a real prize did we do a raffle for that we did gift cards okay um and you know that came out of the budget and then anything could be donated but the the donation were it was the bbcf raising money but we can also take any donations and just make it part of prizes cuz that that wall looked cool with all those prizes up there like the it was not a kayak a a board it was um um card an inflatable paddle board it was beautiful it was all you know an a bush stuff so is that going to be your category for um bbcf to help nobody I nobody's mentioned this I can put it on our agenda as the secretary I'm just saying that cuz that's what you said what it was we have no but that's a good opportunity for us to come in and maybe just have a booth and then we can donate that but let me bring it to my board and I will ask them and I think it's a great idea to um include us in the children and I will give them the dates and I will answer back with Renee if that's okay is that okay with everyone sounds great and I'll see what involvement they would like to take in it sounds good okay so the city does not have a cornhole game the city does not want one because it does involve storage they fold up legs go under and they yeah the legs do yeah then it's only this wide but and they have these um plastic ones now that are really nice for out what no they're like they're like the PBC I was going to say what the boards so they don't like deteriorate out in the rain and stuff like they're outoor boards thec you know materials us I use the word was L for alurn and he said you can't make it I'll make it it never easy to make are I have but they're good yeah real good there's some issues with them they're not like you know like a team or anything on it I was thinking a team would be really I mean a Beller beach one would be really cool that would be awesome I think eron should make one a yeah well that's what I was talking to him about he's going to make us one sure okay Who's the artist one who can we get to draw the b beach anybody in here draw draw it I rather get like a sticker or I can do it by the cricket machine make a decal I can do it oh you have your connections use the official logo that would be great yeah if you just put then we could have that cornhole contest but what is it the cornhole compest the cornhole when we're doing the monthly activities and you said cornhole and that you know if we had two sets that'd be cool yeah we could have four sets but per two more than when we make that that should be enough trust me I'm not bringing them down them you know just do I need to donate the wood do we have do we have any are you a builder can you do things like that do that you could make a cornhole no Deb can't okay no she can't I'll stick to Italian food I don't even know about that yet yeah well it's true keep on waiting okay I'll bring you guys all right so I'm going to make a motion that I'm going to move that Deb

right de will bring lunch it will be a lunch meeting all right so now we need to schedule that I never get an invite okay so um can I just jump back to the Morgan Park mural for one moment I know I I guess okay I just want to make sure that even though we can't show it until like July 1st that maybe we can have him tweet those designs a little bit or I'm a little concerned about how the the turtle is underneath his hand is underneath the belir beach I'm I think maybe it's going to get a little busy in the letters I don't know little turtles like kind of erased up it's going right through it right through the l e maybe not bad I how I'm visualizing I don't think it' be I don't you don't think it'll be an issue want to chase off our artists exactly I think okay I think he knows a lot more about drawing than I ever thought about and you even if it was a concern you could even have put like a um like a contour line where it stops before the lettering okay rather than going through the lettering I'm assuming that he's posted that house has have you oh my word it's gorgeous yeah I show just toyd and he goes oh we should have paint something on our house I said where I saw somebody paint beautiful flowers on the garage door like hibiscus it was gorgeous yeah and and this is an either or yeah well it can't be this this is disgusting so it would have to be the I'm sorry rainbow
