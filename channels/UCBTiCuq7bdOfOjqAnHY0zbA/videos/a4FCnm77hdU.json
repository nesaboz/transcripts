I'll uh asked for approval of the agenda for the minutes for Tuesday May 3rd 2023 uh agenda of the city of Bellaire Beach audit committee BD I will make the motion Bible second okay good job oh about

favor aye aye any opposed okay so that is approved yeah I'm sorry May 3rd can you make that change today [Applause] um foreign agenda for the proper day thanks Top so next item is to review and accept the draft of the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ended September 30th 2022 so we'll open up to any comments or questions so this got the uh the data and statistics added to it that we talked about in the last meeting this doesn't say drugs um so this will be what we recommend to take the council yeah there were no substantial changes other than formatting and the you know different things that you have pointed out we did add the missing staff tables in there and then the reason I wanted to come today was to talk to you about the gfoa award process a little bit um sorry if you had it looks like you've got sticky notes well these these were the reminders of the things that we mentioned to see if they made it into this and this one was the man notice of the excess of yes that's page 23. page 23 yeah excess I don't see that that made it in there yeah it is over expenditures yeah oh it's down below yes excellent okay okay yep yep yep I've got that the other ones looked like yeah they had made it in yeah page 14 was corrected it page 44. uh 44 yeah so that was where uh we had recommended the Auditors group guidance that we needed to create an allowance for the AR and aging uh do we get that feedback and so it was basically uh talking to Heather here as we was waiting to get going I feel like it's fully collectible and so there was no uh suggested to the auditor and so uh okay so even though our expectations historically have always been there's mitigation of some it doesn't really matter for the report if we assume going in assuming then this is the amount we're asking for yes so the council has not taken any action they've made no indication that any of that amount is going to be forgiven so we don't even have a way to quantify an allowance against it at this point in time yeah I mean they've made comments that they're not going to uh accept anything or they or we shouldn't but we know we always do but there's nothing for you to base correct okay got it agree well in the series of the the conversation between us and the Auditors was they said holy cow who is this resident what's going on with it are you going to really get all this money and I said to the best of my knowledge and then we talked about it you know I'm sure it's been brought to council and again like when I came to just do a quick rundown recently I said you know somebody's going to have to determine what to do with this and they all you know agreed but having an inner ethium quote at the build amount just like any other receivable the ability that you never know correct what's going to happen or what's going to be so yeah can't do anything about that right okay and then in the future maybe it's this year maybe it's next year or whatever time period it gets determined what we're going to do with that property um if they do write off any portion it will be recorded as a bad debt expense in that year yeah so offset any perfect people make sense okay great okay so really quick I won't be low there's a page in here that looks unusual um I'm sorry I don't know it's towards the front it's in place it's like a placeholder instead of the gfoa award so did you it's on a patient side right here five yeah five Roman numeral V so normally um we have our actual award on this page and we have since gotten the award but um it wasn't it hadn't gotten its way to us by press time and so I called the GFA and I said what am I supposed to do we have this audit report we have no award and so this certificate is it's a one-year award one year only so they said I can't include the one from 20 because it's no good this far ahead um and so what I have to do each year is we submit the audit for the award they give the comments back and they say fix this do make this change whatever it is and then for the next year before we submit we have to make sure that we change all those things and you know address their comments each and individually and correctly well so I couldn't do that obviously because I didn't have it and so what the woman said is that for the 23 submission I have to address all the comments from 21 and 22. so I make you know the necessary changes which will be fine um and she also said too that covet hit him so hard and they had they gave a lot of leniency because the award submission is due March 30th so that's why we pushed the auditor so hard to get everything done so that we can submit for this award without asking for an extension well so this woman said that now after covid they form committees even because people are asking for extensions in excess of a year past that ice because they're so so far behind and you know in our situation we could have asked our one month extension because it's one month out of time yeah but she said that these committees have been formed and they're really cracking down and the biggest thing is that you're not going to be granted an extension two years in a row for the same reason so if I say the audit report's not ready this year I can't ask for a one-month extension next year because the audit report's not ready so we talked about it and I said I don't know what's going to happen you know I don't know what's going to happen next year whatever we've got the audit report with this in it and so that was that was the path that we took is to just address both years next year um well the Auditors will be made aware of that oh yeah but we still have to have everything to them at ample time present to respond properly so that seems onerous and it was like you know this is the stuff that keeps me up at night like I'm thinking um what if you know I get this audit report on March 31st and they send me the award on March 31st and I am obligated to make any changes to this before I submit and so I was like I'm just going to go ahead and send it um and this is an optional thing this is we elect to participate in this um it's good it's great to have yeah it's a key part of how well a job you do with the team does so congrats on getting it again this year thank you yes we just got it I think it was like April 14th or something it was dated it sounds nice close but so that's why it looks different um but until we ended up we did get it and then oh and the other thing that she said that is important to know is that um now that they are post covet so to speak um they will not be taking as well to provide the awards so like we submitted in June of last year and we just got it in this April and she realizes that that's an acceptable turnaround time so they're getting it down to less than nine months is this a state office it's the governmental finance officer Association so it's uh yeah so it's all cities that's a little bigger population than just Florida yes and so and just because I'm a nerd I know this um we can't have anybody locally like there's a there's a person that goes through our audit report picks it apart finds things that they want us to change things like that and they can't be from the local area because you can't you can't Prejudice yes exactly looking at your neighbors okay so that was my two cents but I do I did want to come and thank you guys all for um thank you thank you Kyle any other comments from your side or no I just if there's any other questions for Heather while she's here great job thank you appreciate it yeah that's amazing all right so get a motion to uh accept it uh we've reviewed it accepted the uh annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ended September 30th 2022. I so moved a second marker Judd all in favor all right any opposed all right so thank you heather any general business thank you very much uh no do we have any unfinished business the only thing I would say is our next audit committee uh need will be would we review the budget yeah that's the the and so our our function as an audit committee is to review the the audit and to review the budget and I'd like to suggest that we be included in this debate about uh generator maybe that is our other hat our citizens advisor yeah right not the financial yeah the associate advisor coming because it's the same membership yeah yeah except we get to exclude Jody for that discussion never mind we were talking about the generator well I do have one other item of new business okay um so our audit contract was through 9 30 22 and we have the option to renew on an annual basis and so I've approached the Auditors that they've got to come back to us and tell us how much it will cost us um so the other thing that we need to consider is that we got I'm sorry no go ahead um we got all of the arpa money and so what that means is to us is that we will be subject to a single audit for this year for 23. um because we will have spent in excess of 750 000 of federal money that we got and so what that means for the Auditors they're going to charge us a little bit more the terms and conditions of how much more I think I want to say it was like maybe four or five thousand dollars in addition to their base fee because they have to do more procedures they have an extra reporting that they have to do they have different things um so I just wanted that to be brought up I've approached them like and said hey I know that our contract has expired we have to negotiate you know for this upcoming year did it have options it did okay it had an option to renew for um okay it was one year at a time and was I can't remember if it was two was it two years two additional years so that would be for 23 and then 24 as well so I think you're right it was five thousand for the uh Siegel audit yeah extraordinary we approved salt marsh I mean salt marsh was our auditor before and then we approved salt marsh to continue it was the uh cost for certainly I'm thinking eighteen thousand dollars is that I think it went up to 20 for the last year so at a two thousand dollar increase okay yeah and you know they're easy to work with um I have no indication that they don't want to continue this relationship here so it's just I'm not a formality they'll have to send us a new engagement letter you guys will have a review it um maybe we could tie that uh at the same time into the budget meeting yes yeah but these guys I mean salt marsh is kind of the State of Florida kind of yeah they do a great job on the municipal side uh they're big big players and uh so I think we've had a lot of comfort but I also would say that our ability to produce the information they need to generate this document is excellent there can't be other cities that do as good a job that are our size of sending everything and having it ready to go in in this great format so that we're making their job easier in fact oh yes they've told us that so that that deserves a discount all right so uh under the general business we'll be meeting a get to so real quick on as far as the budget calendar when do we squeeze the um I'll have to look yeah I'm gonna go into just I'm just so we can get a timetable that was that after we entered we gave the budget to Council in June um actually I don't know if you guys are on my official budget account I don't think the honest I was trying to remember I can look at last year's I know we talked about it at what point we want to think uh Lynn brought it to us after it was prepared to be Babel simultaneously brought it to us in city council let it go at the same time okay he can bring our comments with the there's a workshop okay okay so I've added that first one baby we meet before the workshop all right okay I'll figure out anything then okay great I didn't quite hear what time did you anticipate the next audit meeting for the budget so I was going to give it hopefully I have meetings with Council in mid to late May and then um was it the first is the June council meeting but that's before the June Workshop yes so I guess I will get it I'll send it out early when I start meeting with the council members okay sending out to everyone early June yeah yeah so probably early June will be yeah great that'll work well for my purposes like for June 1st is a big date for us because that's the first time we get evaluation from the property appraiser right and so that's the first time we get a good number for that ad Memorial um and I feel like our our budget schedule is kind of tied to that as well um so I think I would say that it must be right after that though okay we've got Stefan on the books so she did three years projections for the bond issue it should be pretty easy I just keep going up and up and so when I get that email went like how much how much yeah out we'll take that you know so we want that number so we'll meet early June yeah yeah okay great any other topics for discussion no get a boat should do a jerk Shire Tom Tom second here all right all a favor hi hi great thanks everybody thank you thanks Tom thanks Jody thank you all"
