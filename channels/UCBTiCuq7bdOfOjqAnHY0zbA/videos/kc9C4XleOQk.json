things that they're requesting as you know Frank banker and city council um he volunteers there and so he he mentioned it each cleanup one day that there was a need so we thought that we would do a drive during the month of February um keep Pinellas beautiful I posted about this um our first Bridge cleanup was very successful we had 22 volunteers which was wonderful and we collected about 40 bags of trash from under the bridge please look for our new sign they should be installing it on the causeway shortly and our next cleanup is in April and then last but not least the receipts if you

thank you very much thank you would any other citizens like to speak all right so that closes citizen comments uh now we're on the item three we have a presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office uh beginning with law enforcement uh monthly report good evening to everyone sergeant Roy switch with the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office and I am here presenting the activity for December of 2022 under the UCR property and person crimes old Riley would like to say that it was a slow month but unfortunately if you weren't aware we had a lot of vehicle burglaries uh one weekend during the month of December it was the weekend I believe of December 10th and 11th so with that being said uh there was also one motor motor vehicle theft related to that burglary where a key was left inside an unlocked vehicle so with that being said again we as the Sheriff's Office strongly encourage residents and visitors to make sure they lock their doors and not leave any valuables inside if we move along to the arrest section there were a total of four people that were arrested within the city and in looking at the activity that looked like that was transient activity a couple of DUIs and a dwlsr under Deputy activity you'll see that there were a total of 720 events in the city leading that word directed patrols and traffic activity uh I'm sorry traffic enforcement yeah and then there was one crash in the city and that was located at Gulf Boulevard and 7th Street and then there were a total of 174 combined citations and warnings issued within the city and that is all I have questions from the council uh Mr Banker um there's car Berger he's back on December 10th and 11th I was I mean was anyone apprehended or caught in in the research that I did there has not yet been anybody apprehended the detectives are following up on any leads looking at video evidence and whatever they can find to go from there I just want to comment that um the deputies were going up and down this your deputies were going up and down the street knocking on everybody's door I thought that was just great I mean really concerned about it well that is uh obviously and I wasn't working that weekend my deputies weren't working that weekend but I enjoy as part of routine Patrol driving up and down every street within the city and I can tell you that Deputy Dean also enjoys driving up and down the city sits out on Gulf Boulevard so unfortunately we can't be everywhere so that's where we strongly encourage residents to make sure that they lock their doors and not leave any valuables inside thank you any other questions or comments thank you very much Sergeant thank you all right now we're on to code enforcements uh monthly report deputy clapcon good evening Mr mayor council member staff citizens Deputy clapka for the record uh as you see in your reports we uh again very busy for the month of January um some of the things that we did take care of is we had three properties within Bellaire Beach that we had some major issues on one at 12th in golf one on 17th and one on 21st with the help of uh Kyle we issued uh letters and some cleaned up um and again throughout the city also trying to get some more of the citizens to comply with local ordinances um had a few extra issues with permits again uh unlicensed contractors but again we were working on that with the building department and the uh Pinellas County Construction licensing board questions or comments from the council yeah Mrs Abel I'm looking down the list here uh 109 13th Street was that mentioned on previous month reports of code violations uh 109 13th show shares posted notice reference to violation oh yes that was a um an issue they were having a pool installed there and so um there's a sediment bag that had to be changed so yeah we had some issues with that before okay thanks any other questions or comments uh I I did notice that uh we received more information than we usually do which is uh which is nice um I'm sure it's a it's a combined effort to put all this together but this is uh this is incredible data and it's nice to see it thank you well the credit's got to go to Kyle he's my teacher and we just kind of worked on these things together but yes all right thank you very much thank you foreign now we are on to item four this is a presentation from Pinellas Suncoast fire and rescue this District by Chief Jeff Davidson I have invited Jeff Davidson to begin giving us monthly reports again uh so with that being said take it away thank you the council members and Community I'm Jeffrey Davis on the fire chief for Pinellas Suncoast fire rescue District probably serving Miller Beach on behalf of the Empire District I wanted to express my sincere thank you for the support on passing the referendum vote in November by 74 which will allow us to continue to serve our residents in belar Beach we've been serving since 1951 so thank everybody very much for your support there's a lot of activity in psfrd as we continue to strengthen our organization we're actively pursuing the assistance of firefighter grants to former and based on the population we're eligible for up to one million dollars in funding and we're looking at all the items that meet the notice of funding opportunities requirements those submissions are due this Friday and the awards begin weekly in September so we're submitting for new fire hose extrication equipment bunker gear thermal imaging cameras new Motorola radios physical fitness equipment uh many more things that firefighters need to do their jobs in the upcoming months I will be asking liberative Commissioners to allow me to put out a RFP for fire station design and construction we are conducting a study uh to verify the proper placement of the stations and currently we were looking at least uh from the fire station at the very Northern end of Indian Rocks Beach to better serve the city of Bel Air Beach firefighters economics recently saved the life of a commissioner and a neighboring Town who had suffered a municiple attack a replacement of the AED CPM by the police chief who was there was very instrumental uh my Crews arrived under foreign Advanced cardiac life support and Basin was transferred to a local hospital and he made a recovery um I submitted that to the dining room Legacy foundation and our crews were chosen out of all of the most Community to receive an award that the First Responders appreciation dinner this Saturday so I'm very proud of the hard work and Professional Services that our firefighters and paramedics always provide to our community I would like to ask the Commissioners here today Council owners to allow me to use the Bel Air Base City Hall to doing public information session upcoming uh on the status of the Emergency Medical Services for the beaches particularly by the beach and how the services need to be improved and would be funded by the county at no additional cost to our residents um if I could have your permission to coordinate a date that the hall is open and looking at possibly February 27th Monday night and it would be open to questions answers and a presentation from anybody who would like to attend thank you Chief Davidson uh Council uh for uh uh turn the floor over to you uh does anyone have a problem with uh with the chief working a date out with the city manager for this event oh okay it sounds like uh you just need to reach out to the city manager and uh and and plan a date accordingly and we look forward to that uh now uh council do you have any questions for the fire chief hello all right I I have I have one what was the response time on the event that you described to us the resp uh from notification to the fire department to at the patient was uh four minutes and three seconds I believe and that's one of the things that I want to explain in this presentation is the correlation between time and survival rates you know there's a lot of things that in the medical field where time is muscle if it's a cardiac event or time is brain if it's a stroke of it and things that need to be done and some things that are lacking in the system that have been lacking for quite some time um and I want to address how we can fix that so that we can have the best services for our residents and all of our visitors to keep everybody safe thank you very much that's a that's an impressive time and uh I hope that I never have to use your services but if I do I hope you're that close yes sir I left a few business cards on the table if anybody like to get a hold of me ever my email address and phone numbers on there you can call me anytime and again thank you very much thank you thank you all right we're up to item number five uh this is the city attorney's report Mr Mora you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor um during the last few weeks I had the occasion to meet with the manager on a few occasions on various items uh one of which was facilitating two meetings with the planning and zoning and board in its capacity as your land Planning Association so we continue to move forward potential comp plan amendments as well as um one of the ordinances that's before you this evening as we approach discussing the ordinance this evening it occurred to me that before our last meeting on the 21st I had the opportunity to travel to St Augustine and present to the institute for elected Municipal officials Nemo um your newest council member joined there and attended and I had the opportunity to present on a parliamentary procedure in the role of the City attorney one of the things that I talked to at some length I mean that was only a few weeks after having given a similar presentation to the Volusia County Commission was on the importance of debating the measure at hand and not the individual members or motives of your peers ostensibly we are all here in service of the public trust at the last meeting and on at least at one likely two occasions that I can remember previously there's been some suggestion that I produce work product for you with the sole purpose of generating lawsuits or some other profit mechanism for myself on the back end I take my job very seriously I take the my my oath to the Florida bar the oath I take as a constitutional officer Charter officer in your communities this is my livelihood this is how I put food on the table this is my good name so it's important to me that you recognize that as I give you work product I take no issue with you telling me that you're unsatisfied with the work product that you think the policy should move in a different direction be better framed better phrased approach differently take into account factors that I may have in my uh infallible state of the human uh overlooked some Factor I'm happy to consider all of that all of that is appropriate I will I do take umbrage with the suggestion uh that I'm doing work driven by some profit motive most especially because I I truly believe in the altruism of what it is you folks do I thank you for the work you do because frankly I don't do it I get to tell you man that sounds like a tough decision tell me what you're going to say um and and that's how this whole system works I I can't allow um something as Insidious as that to go and address and I did not wish to derail your work session as you debated an important matter to your community by addressing it in that moment but it was something that to me I felt needed addressing so I appreciate the opportunity to address that during my report otherwise I continue to work with the manager to advance the suggested revisions to the sign code to advance your comp plan amendments through the LPA and any other issues as they present themselves and I'm happy to answer any questions or address any concerns you may have thank you Council any questions for Mr Moore yes Mike said yeah I just want to thank you personally um you know looking at what you do for us and the beliefs and if you're talking with you I appreciate everything you do for this Council thank you very much no I appreciate that and I'm certainly not fishing for any uh compliments or anything of this sort though I appreciate the gesture I just wish to make clear that I can let us see my life that go unaddressed um anyone else like to make a comment well all right thank you for addressing that and uh I appreciate your work also and thank you for this report all right next we are up to item six which is the city manager's report Mr riesler thank you mayor and Council um starting off with the 12th and 13th Street project um we did on January 24th get that valve I talked about in the last meeting replaced we came in under warranty from the manufacturer the staff got out there immediately put it back in so that the the check valve is functioning properly and they're not getting uh tied washing back into the streets um we came a little bit over budget that is on the agenda tonight for a budget amendment um I did get one of the quotes back from the televised uh for the Cure in place lining and uh for two pipes uh we're looking at about fifty thousand dollars I want to see if I can get that out to bid possibly in our next stormwater project because if we can get uh competitive pricing on that um it'll be useful to us when we need to do pipe repair so hoping to tag dial Along on on the bid the uh underground project um right now we're just waiting on the materials once the Duke gets the materials uh stockpiled at the marina same place as the last project you know it'll take off pretty quickly um with the conduit going in the 7th Street um boat ramp I got a sketch drawing from the engineer it was the last meeting you asked if there was some way we can make the ramp more functional for the residents he recommended if we do anything we uh he at the end of the ramp um in burlap and uh he inter in her uh I guess interlace you'd say so the seams don't line up and some uh Filter Fabric underneath it and he says that's done in a lot of areas and that that'll just increase like the stability of the ground after the ramp so I'm glad I ordered all the supplies my staff um will be out there probably tomorrow morning finishing that up um after that you know they they replaced all the filter in the sod on January 26th I think they did a beautiful job um really excited to get the ramp open for the residents um for our 17th and 8th Street 18th streets project uh the citizens advisory chair Ron saganic and I have been working pretty hard along with Heather our financial advisor and uh putting the other projections uh for the next five years and we've shared that with the financers and we're looking good to be a approved for a loan and we're at this point where uh we received one-term sheep um from One bank and we're trying to get another from South State so um at that point we're going to take it back to the CAC and then uh you'll be hearing from us at one of these meetings for a presentation proposal um code enforcement uh like I said I I kind of revise the report I tried to admit a little bit more visual take out a lot of the the check boxes that were in between all the cells and uh relate it back to the survey we did so what I did so what I did is I uh made Steve's report um a drop down list of of the categories we talked about in our survey so that he could select what you know what where the issue fell and then we could track it and then be able to put the numbers back when we resurvey um another thing I noticed I was looking at it is we kind of had like a start date a close date and if you looked at every violation it was like it started and closed on the same day and then we had this days open saying it didn't really apply to anything so I reworked the sheets so that um and it instructed Steve that when you know his first sighting or whatever the violation he he keeps that date and then when he comes back and closes it up it bounces back around and shows the total days open so it reflects the number that until the issue was solved um like I said I tried to put some graphs in here I'm using Excel just to kind of give it an overview of if you're going to look at it real quick um you can see kind of the areas we're focusing on if there's any concerns from the council um I think you know you'll be able to see where the efforts get in focused and uh maybe ask questions or suggest some some different things to focus on the other graph it's another pie graph it's just up the streets I think Steve does pretty good job getting around the city pretty pretty equally um but it just kind of lays out all the different streets he's hit and then the last um table I put it was an outstanding code violations and this is actually an idea from a resident um who asked you know what's going on with this issue um and how do we get information on it I was like this is a very good point because it's the code enforcement report you know only shows month to month and it doesn't track things that are outstanding so I kind of put together this outstanding I think it's good because um you know so it shows the run up on fines so that just everyone's in the know and uh you know let's uh when uh code violation notices or uh hearings are sent out so we can track it and that keeps the days so the city hall generator I got another option it's the uh it's a mobile unit it's used it's got a one-year warranty I asked if there's any uh extended warranty plan for that but it's a diesel generator and if we were to get because in the past if you remember it was I think donated to the fire department but we had a mobile generator that is what hooked up to the Quick Connect out there so it's pretty much the same idea to run the whole building um if we use the same connection point which would be in the back um it's a lower elevation but it would be 97 000. um which is a lot lower than the original price we had on the natural gas generator uh but if we want to it is another option because the parking lot's a higher area um and you know if we get flooding down in there we can put the connection station where the crawl space is by the building and the front parking lot and pull right up into there and hook it up so it wouldn't be uh we would be avoiding the cost of putting it up on a stand and um you know we could tuck it away when we're using it let me ask where you would store a uh a trailer generator app I'd back it up into the the yard over there it'd be it'd be a little tight but we could do it all right um we stockpile some materials there so we just free that out um Gulf Mexico blue replacement uh I have the permit I am waiting on one more um installation quote good news is I did find a contractor to do it at about 12 500 for the 16 buoys so that's a lot lower than 20 000. um and then as far as uh Bel Air Shore um I relayed the message to their uh their Town attorney and she's taking it to the February 21st meeting um along the lines that if we are willing to fund the cost of the installation the buoys and the maintenance would they be willing to do the other necessary steps of changing their ordinance so we'll see what comes back on that uh Morgan Park parking lot is getting done this this month I just checked in with the contractor tried to get a date set up well we'll have to close the park uh at least the parking lot for two days um children's playground that got the shipping date got pushed back to April 14th it sounds like it's solid at this point a little disappointing it's taking so long um but the uh the used playset uh company is still interested in removing the old one so I'm kind of keeping in touch that's it that's all I have thank you uh Council any questions yes uh Mr Banker good questions do you know the make of the generator it's a John Deere John Deere yes um so we probably can get a maintenance contract off of a local John Deere dealer right um and I don't want to approach one I don't know if you're going to address this Mr Mayor or not but this letter up here on 109 13th Street and it's it's in his city managers report seeing this guy's been here eight years and he I guess he's not getting the gist of our short-term rentals or whatever this is um uh I I wasn't planning on addressing it at all this is just information okay for the record um I think members Abel was asking about the 109 13th Street and that is a short-term rental and it does have a hearing scheduled okay this week thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager yes sir Mr Roberts so Kyle on the um extending the boat ramp on 7th street I'm just curious so and I should go down there myself to see it but when it's low tide is the end of the ramp still in the water or when the Tide's very very low it it really pulls back I mean you get that little island out there that gets exposed so there's still good at the back far out into the into the water launch a boat at that point okay if that's what they want to do it's possible but it really does draw back okay so the engineering firm has in mind at some distance that they're going to extend those concrete bags rip rack bags yep too so allow boat trailers to go further to go further up on a state basically get down to the to the bottom of the submerged land and just um without like a drop-off or anything unstable okay now as far as the water going back if it really Tides out you know they're just gonna have to go as back if they can okay the goal was to make sure that they didn't have a ledge that they would fall off of and they couldn't recover from it correct right um the 17th and 18th Street storm water project so that's listed there is a single project but we're really not pursuing that as a single project is that correct that's correct at this point we want to to pull a bond issue and a loan to do all the projects together for all of them that's beautiful okay um okay that was it thank you any other questions or comments no uh Mr riefler um I I gave you a call a week or two ago about a situation where uh there was growth coming out into the street it was a hazard and it was uh an eyesore I won't mention what street it was but uh it was an unfortunate situation where the homeowner it was physically impossible for the homeowner to do anything about it so I called Mr riesler and and he took care of it him and his staff took care of it and I greatly appreciate it as I'm sure the residents do that surround that that location so thank you very much yes sir sorry thank you um on the 12th and 13th Street I did see the contractor out there maybe a week or two ago where they were addressing some of the low spots in the gutter which is wonderful but it looks like and I know you would probably know more than I because you're watching it more than I am but it looks like kind of a domino effect where they would raise the gutter level um to make the water move in a certain direction it may have caused uh you know an additional problem Upstream for backup lack of a better term in the gutter systems but I know you're on top of that so are they finished completely because I have still noticed some gutters that are holding water we're still holding the retainage so all the engineer go back and make sure okay there was that one section they put that uh flow line in that didn't it was pretty much flat didn't even have a flow line um by the pond okay um is there a specific area uh 12th or 13th yeah they were working kind of on uh 12. close to the pond you know on the other side of the pond so they were working in there raising it which I'm sure that was a low spot so they were trying to create a scenario where the water would move to one of the grates which I'm sure it did but in doing so it sort of looked like because they raised that area to move the water they had some water upstream was now being held back but something to just take a look at and across the street I did notice one thing that I meant to ask you before one of the greats looks like I guess they weren't removed during the original project that is uh the lack of a better term it's Rusty looks older right right there at the turn when you come in when you're heading uh East on 12th and you make a left-hand turn what's that bay is it called Bay yeah um right there on the left hand side it maybe that was one of those grades where we we couldn't get them out I'm not sure what the deal was there they should all be new grades and it I'll take a look at it okay thanks anyone else no all right thank you very much Mr rieckler I appreciate all your hard work thank you up next number seven Patty Gentry I don't have a project update per se but for personnel you saw you met Aaron and he's really jumped in with both bees really enthusiastic and then we made a offer of employment for an administrative assistant so we're waiting for that process to go through you know for more help in the front to help more residents and we're really excited about that and that's that's all I have all right thank you very much any uh questions for Patty no thank you very much Patty all right uh now we are up to the consent agenda this is items eight and nine it's for approval of the January 9th 2023 city council uh meeting minutes and approval of the January 23rd 2023 city council work session minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve as presented ocean made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Floyd Roberts all in favor aye any opposed the consent agenda passes all right we are now on to the regular agenda item number 10 uh this is for consideration of the appointment of Mr Mark Mariano as a board of adjustments alternate member if Mr Mariano is present would he like to address the council thank you good evening Council mayor thanks for having me um so recently moved to the city of Bellaire Beach approximately a year ago moved from the town of Bel Air served on the planning board there for about seven or eight years um I have about 24-ish years of experience in land planning City Planning I own my own real estate development company now I'm the CEO of another real estate development company so I do bring a unique perspective and level of experience to the boards and I do like to give back to the community and participate as a board member where I can um and when I moved in I talked to Patty about any openings there weren't uh circled back I don't know towards the end of the year ass began and she said yeah there are two one for the board of adjustments and then one for maybe a Parks and Rec board which probably is less applicable to my experience level so I sent the application in and Mr Gentry said yeah why don't you come in and meet the board there is a alternative spot open so I'm here to see if I could be appointed to the board of adjustments thank you very much first off am I pronouncing your name correct Mariano Mariano okay good um I'd like for you to stick around for just a few minutes uh council do you have any questions for Mr Mariano yes Mike say are you pursuing any uh business within Bel Air Beach at this time no we don't we do multi-family residential um apartment communities that was my old company now we do uh multi-family but it's single-family rental large scale 350 400 unit developments throughout Florida and seven other states across the country so no nothing here any other questions okay Mr uh Mariano I um I Heard a little bit about you and uh apparently you were just grossly overqualified for this position uh however uh if you would like to stick around and and uh work with us uh we'll we'll wait and see what the council says and uh I appreciate you applying for the position all right thank you all right let's go to the citizens uh you can have a seat sir let's go to the citizens for comments uh would anyone like to comment uh yes sir Mike Kelly evening Council my name is Mike Kelly I'm your board of adjustment chairman um I've I agree that Mr Mariano is very very qualified for position I think the opportunity of our board to to add him as an alternate member and potentially an ultimately on the actual board is is an advantage for Bellaire Beach I've had the opportunity to work with Mr Mariano's development company Mosaic in the last two years at a commercial project in downtown St Petersburg although I only had a couple meetings with him pre-construction working with the general contractor the the job went very smooth and the staff and the experience that I had working with his firm was very very positive so I endorse the council to consider his appointment and recommend him to be at a door board thank you very much Mr Kelly all right before we uh we debate this appointment I'm going to need a motion uh to move forward with this appointment absolute motion made by Leslie nataro do I have a second second by Mike Sable uh Miss Notaro you have the floor um no further comments right would anyone else like to comment no all right well and if that's the case uh Miss Gentry would you please call the roller yes council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts council member Zabo yes mayor Gaddis hi so uh this is unanimously congratulations Mr Mariano and thank you for volunteering to serve the city of Bellaire Beach all right we're on to agenda item number 11. uh this is consideration of ordinance 23-01 Mr Mora would you please read the ordinance probably Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-01 an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending section 94-220 pertaining to the table of designated living areas and housing setbacks providing sufferability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading of ordinance 23-01 by title only and did you want to lead on presentation or would you prefer I was all right all right thank you thank you Mr Moore uh um yes you're about to give us a brief history of this ordinance and what it will will accomplish yes uh there's been a few in in the recent months there's been a few hearings that have preceded a variance um not based on any um misrepresentations by a property owner or perhaps not even based on staff oversight but based on confusion with how the city's code should be administered I have in the final row it suggests be here all right so thank you thank you and I apologize for stopping the floor all right um would anyone else like to make a comment or a question yes Mr Roberts I think that's a great idea in the future projects that anything we can do to minimize the as needed phrase so that we can tighten down on the budget and and get closer at the end of the project so I think that's great in the future we do that so that's perfect uh I too appreciate the great amount of detail that you're giving us uh whenever you're especially whenever you're asking for money uh it's a it's this is a very refreshing and uh I'm sure all of us appreciate it uh do we have any more comments or questions before we take this to a vote no all right Patty would you mind calling the role council member Banker yes councilmember Notaro yes council member Livingstone yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye mayor Gaddis aye the perfect score tonight uh unanimous Mr riefler you are approved to amend the budget thank you okay now we are on to unfinished business do we have any unfinished business I think we've pretty much covered everything in the city managers report that uh it was outstanding uh right and now we are on to council member comments this month the computer is selected council member Roberts all right you have the floor is that like the lottery so um actually I do have something to say Kyle about the um on the 12th and 13th Street project so for the cured in place um pipe with the two pipes that are actually that go to the outfalls into the um um area that we've talked about previously could we could we talk to the engineering firm to see if they could come up with additional alternate options obviously cured in place is one option another one might be to slip line those pipes that would reduce some of the volume because it's a pipe within a pipe technology changes so fast out there so that we could ask for alternate approaches so that when it goes out to bed that the contractors could maybe on their own if we give them the authority to submit an alternate bid that they think May save us money and provide us with a similar quality solution just so we're not confining the bid to one option and perhaps there's another option available out there that they they're aware of but we didn't give them that flexibility for something to take a look at yes thanks thank you Mr Roberts next up is council member Notaro no kind of council member Livingstone good evening I had a conversation with Kyle before the meeting I had a citizen come up to me inquiring about the road signs in Bel Air and how the Sun fading has affected several of them and Kyle has assured me that those rounds happen on a semi-annual basis and that with the implementation of our new team team member that he will be checking that that'll be on his checklist that's going to be one of Aaron's new assignments I'm happy to say we have him um takes a lot of weight off of me and yeah we'll be checking that out thank you very much and just for the rest of us if we have a home and and the road signs are in your home and and there's some foliage some Hedges whatnot that are impeding those signs just to be aware of that and and make sure for the safety of all of our residents that that we take care of those because um Carl assured me that that's our our responsibility as homeowners so thank you for that Kyle um I welcome our new team member on board I think he already left for the evening and also welcome Mark to the team so just just as a comment he had a very late flight I think he got in about 3 30 this morning so he was very tired all day just wanna I can imagine thank you normally we'd say there's no excuse for that all right council member Banker no comments Mr Mayor no comment all right council members Abel sure just want to say thank you to councilman Frank uh Baker for the invocation of the Pledge of Allegiance and for admin I have I will be out the next uh monthly council meeting I got a corporate meeting out on the west coast that same day thank you very much all right um uh vice mayor Shirley is out so uh now I'm up I met with the other Sam key Mayors today uh as uh along with the county commissioner Brian Scott we discussed alternatives for Beach nourishment right now it looks like the um Army Corps of Engineers who's unwilling to move on this project and uh the clock is ticking every time we get a heavy rain uh wind any type of a storm it's just whittling away at our Beach uh and we're in good shape compared to many of the others uh farther south on Sand Key island today was just a start we we had uh some some Lively discussion uh and I think having commissioner Scott there the word will will get back to the County Commission that it's probably time that they seriously considered doing something for our beaches um without the beaches they would not be able to collect the amount of Revenue that they do and and I think it's time that uh they they consider giving some of that back to save our beaches um we're meeting again soon and we're also going to take uh the County Administrator for a little tour to show him exactly what's going on with the beaches make sure that he's fully aware and uh and held accountable um as we continue to discuss this and have these meetings I will do everything I can to keep you updated during our meetings uh and other than that as always I'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and for those attending at home I do apologize if there was a break in communication and uh uh keep keep your messages uh coming in if there's a failure please notify one of this if not the city manager uh just to make him aware that maybe we should halt the meeting for a couple of minutes and without all that being said do I have a motion to adjourn motion adjourn motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second made by Lloyd Roberts all in favor aye aye any opposed good night everyone sorry so I can ask this question right on the court"
