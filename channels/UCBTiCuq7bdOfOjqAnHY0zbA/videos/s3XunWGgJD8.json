it's also used in geoengineering to give this up include the planet the geoengineering plus natural infusion of sulfur dioxide in our atmosphere through volcanoes will cause greater dimming of the sun causing even lower temperatures worldwide leading to food production failure undulations in temperature and humidity will Fast Track crop failures and food shortages as plants struggle to survive please look at the website adapt 2030 that will get a lot of good information on this information it is more important now than ever to stop geoengineering we are more fortunate than most States and

landlocked global warming is a farce it will be used as a lie to cover up that's coming we are on the solar Max of our 11-year solar cycle we had five more years of warmth before we head into a normal

were a total of 649 events in the city leaving that as always direct the patrols traffic enforcement and parking enforcement next there was one crash within the city that occurred at golf and Causeway and I will Circle back to that there were a total of 147 citations and warnings issued touching on the crash that was at Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard last month if you'll remember I was asked whether or not if I could determine the causation of that crash at that particular intersection I did look it up and it looks like it was distracted driving it was a three vehicle crash they were trying to turn north coming from westbound on Causeway to turn north on golf and the the last vehicle in line struck the vehicle in front which subsequently struck the vehicle in front other than that that is it thank you Sergeant but if we have any questions or comments from the council thank you very much thank you all right next up code enforcement report good evening Deputy Steve clackett for the record um Commissioners mayor again we had another active month with some of these code enforcement violations as you see on your sheets that the biggest one we're celebrating problem with is the dealing with contractors permits and unlicensed individuals there's still a few of them that I am following up on through the building department along with the construction licensing board the other event that we had was the short-term rental uh just this past week we had a hearing again on two different violations at the same residence and we have another one coming up in uh this Thursday I had that same residence other than that that's my report and I'll stand for any questions thank you Deputy do we have any questions you're doing a great job thank you sir you all have a great evening thank you very much thank you all right next up we have the presentation from the Pinellas Suncoast fire and rescue District of E.T Davis good evening everyone I wanted to give you the monthly report and tell you I was at the fundraiser the kayak launch fundraiser what a great time I'm glad to see that they raised the money that they needed for that but what a great time thank you very much in the month of April we had 15 calls for emergency services into Belair Beach I know that I talked to you before that I'm working diligently on getting an additional fire department unit that's fully staffed fully funded by the county and no additional cost to our taxpayers these taxpayers already paid that money and I'm asking but they can't even fund that unit and my plan is to move a truck to be here closer here to service Bellaire Beach so I had one meeting last week with the county I had one tomorrow and then one at the end of May and I really urge you to write to your MC committee the Emergency Services advisement Council and right to your County Commissioners this is the time of year that they make budget decisions and it gets pushed up to County Commissioners and this enhancement is a dire need to better serve our communities so I guarantee to do that on June 8th 2023 we are hosting right here in Bel Air Beach we are hosting a hurricane and water safety Expo I should have a flyer in front of you but there's some flyers in the back there as well and it's June 8th 2023 from 1 to 6 p.m we'll have some vendors here that didn't do life jacket giveaways Beach and boat safety information you can meet your local firefighters there'll be a couple of meteorologists one from Channel 10 Tampa Bay and one from Bay News 9 and the vanilla Suncoast professional firefighters will be hosting a cookout out here until supplies last and I guess they'd be you know burgers and hot dogs and things like that and we're also planning to do a demonstration with our fire boat here and our marine Rescue Unit um and that is schedule for 2 30. but the schedule's on the back of the flyer Flyers are coming up on the table there and we hope to have a great day with you all thank you if we have any questions or comments for achievements the council is very quiet tonight yes boy Roberts so just a quick question on the uh cookout is that well that started that's very important to me but I started one o'clock or do you know I do not know that part is sponsored by the union okay but I'll make sure I find out any any special requests like what time do you like to eat there sir um not really it's not tenuous all right continuous all right well it says while supplies last but I will find out exactly what what time they're going to cook out thank you I'll let you know right right and you can see your council member Roberts uh priorities I did have a couple of questions for you this morning there was a a golf cart that somehow caught on the fire and the first off you know anything about how that fire started and it's a two-part question and then the second part I noticed that the truck was coming from Largo they came service that require so can you give us some details yes I can uh so uh that was just after eight o'clock this morning it was in the 24th Avenue in Iraq's beach in Northern end and the call came in as just a golf cart smoking and it was I was actually driving in and I thought it was a lot more than a golf cart on Fires you know a lot of thick black smoke pouring across and until we get there and decide what's you know determine what's on fire you know we asked for more for more people it was look like possibly you know building a lot of times Vehicles will catch Empire inside a garage or next to another car or things like that so um but that so I was the first one there but I just happened to be on the road engine from Station 27 their first two to that area but they were out so the second due to that area um is clear waters 44 it's a on Sand Key so they were coming and when I was about a half a mile away I could see so much black smoke which is an indicator there is a something burning um that I had asked for additional units I made dispatched the rest of the units as if we were responding to a structure fire which is a total of 15 more people so that might be what you saw when when Largo was coming across the bridge was on that fire response but then when I got there I could see it was uh the golf cart that was fully involved it had caught the power pole on fire you know we call the power company out to make sure the pool's safe and everything but [Music] um as far as the cause hasn't been determined most likely is from somewhere in the batteries they're you know a charging issue it wasn't plugged in it was just sitting there and looked like the public beach access and we put it in there yeah sure is it electric or gas uh no that was battery hungry yesterday all right the only other uh comment I have or actually request is I noticed that you gave us some statistics on emergency services that were provided and in the city of lrp is there any way that you could maybe provide us with those email Patty absolutely for the meeting so we can kind of look them over I think we normally our meetings here on Monday and we shut down incoming documentation for the agendas on Wednesday absolutely I would appreciate it and I'm happy to share that with you and then have to explain everything how they come up with those numbers and what everything means all right any other questions or comments all right thank you very much thank you okay next okay we were expecting a presentation from the Pinellas County Metropolitan planning organization membership three proportionment plan with Glenn okay what I'm going to request is that we we table this one and then bring it back up and uh if that's okay with the council let's continue on all right item six presentation um career in this presentation well I yeah yeah this is it yeah um Kyle was going to accept it are you going to accept it yeah and I yeah I don't have a actual certificate other than that okay good right not like a city manager refer to meet me uh so what I have here is an award a financial reporting achievement is presented to the finance department city of Bellaire beach by the government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada what that means is that we're doing everything right and uh they're we're not failing any audits we're doing everything to a standard that's the highest standard you can get for a municipality so congratulations to city manager reefler and uh and the rest of the city staff and our accounting firm [Applause] all right item seven city attorney's report Mr Moore you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor good evening all of you as far as legal updates we'll start with the legislative session we have about four days left of the legislative session in our and hopefully be a little less tense at least for me uh we're we're continuing to monitor a number of pieces of legislation I emailed you this weekend about Senate Bill 774 on the financial disclosures I'm not totally clear how to read the where that is on the Senate side it unequivocally passed the Senate it's house corollary says that there's a there's an indication it was laid on the table um but then it says referencing uh reference to Senate Bill substitute so I can't tell if that means when something's laid on the table for the house that means it's equivalent to voting it down especially at this stage in the legislature I can't tell if they're saying the house version has been laid on the table and we're now proceeding on the substitute or if the house isn't moving on this would be kind of surprising for how overwhelmingly it passed in the Senate to not see something in the house I suspect it's the former anti-advisor over the weekend that they're just proceeding on the Senate version but I will of course let you know continuing to track that another bill that was of interest to one of the members here specifically was Senate Bill 154 and his house corollary 1395 on the condo bills and that was the condo inspection and sort of depending on how you look at that making it more flexible in light of the different needs of condominium communities across the state that has been laid on the table in the house it doesn't look like that will be passing this session one bill that's gained a lot of attention in this immediate area it's Senate Bill 714 Senate Bill 714 has to do with the regulation of short-term rentals um it passed the how passed the Senate uh late last week Senate Bill 714 makes it it's it is being characterized publicly as giving tools to local governments to regulate short-term rentals my I think I spoke to this in some links last month I would say that anything different than you have home rule powers for everything except these three things we already know the congression we have those tools we don't need this and once you start listing them and suggests everything else is off the table it did pass the Senate it is going before the house if it's going it is it is in messages to the house the house did not hear it today that I'm aware of though we're still tracking sessions so you know things can change moment to moment um that bill is of less import here I don't want to get everybody freaking out you have regulations and restrictions for short-term rentals that pre-date June of 2011 which is a magic date in this legal regime and and the reason that magic date exists it dates back to they passed the first version of this preemption in the 2011 session and said as long as you don't as long as it exists before June 2011 you can keep it and they've kept that construct there have been a few efforts over the years to say to even take that away that did not come up this session so it shouldn't be of terrible impact here as long as we don't think we're even with more restrictions but you can see that the concerns in a lot of your other Beach communities that may not be in that or communities across Florida that may not be in that same position um as indicated this bill passed the Senate it was strong indication during the session during which it passed that Senate leadership was behind this where leadership is supported something that seems more indicative than it's likely to pass especially again given the numbers this session of one party being in power and the governor being of that same party it seems especially now that there's a push a lot at the front end of the first month of session has been publicly characterized as the legislature largely passing much of the governor's requests and initiatives legislatively in this last two or three weeks has been the legislature bank at the beginning their issues out um even if something passes the House and Senate as you will know it still needs to Governor's signature not sure he hasn't articulated anything that you would explicitly be vetoing this session that doesn't mean you won't do it we just don't know what those things are all that to say we will session ends Friday we'll we'll know better at least what has the possibility of being signed there is not a hard timeline it's this weird thing once they pass the House and Senate they go to the governor's desk he doesn't have to sign them all by like May 15th or June 1st last year we were waiting in July to see if some things would be signed in fact I remember talking to remember surely while I was at a continuing education course we were saying at that course we're still waiting to see if he's going to sign some bill so it is entirely possible that after session ends will still there will still be a little bit of a guessing game on where things are going to lie but given the governor's Current public profile it seems he's going to be eager to show that he's getting things done moving them along there were a few bills signed as recently this afternoon so that's where we stand on the legislative session uh something that has been brought up either in my report or otherwise over the last few months as a matter of the property with the radio antenna tower I I exchanged correspondence with their attorney just this afternoon um at the on April 13th he sent some correspondence indicating he intended to have it done by the end of the month um today being May 1st I said you know we have a bacon code enforcement in lightning in Reliance on this where do you stand he said it'll be submitted Wednesday there was a technical issue given the volume of the document and transmitting it it's going to have a propagation study if he says it should be roughly 80 pages of submissions it will be substantive it won't be a you know a hand-drawn thing and two sheets of paper and of course the staff will have to review that and make sure that it you know see what I just can't speak to what the result of that would be because it has to go through review but that is where we stand we should have that submission this week likely by Wednesday other than that um I'm happy to answer any questions you have I don't have anything else that uh Council I just want to thank you for pushing that issue on the uh been up now for over a year and I did some research on myself I can't find any of those Towers that would be wind resistant over 90 miles per hour I'm not there to look at the purpose and I know you sent some information to that effect and of course we will look to that as a resource as as staff conducts its reviews once we have documents and it may follow-up questions if there are Maybe any other questions or comments attorney I appreciate all the updates it sort of looks like Miller Beach is uh is a minority as far as the thinking short-term rounds and uh what's going on that there's there's little towns here and there that are organization like we are we're in our grandmother as I whenever I various meetings around the county there's very few people like us I I think you're in the minority based on your posture and having some kind of you know having that grandfather protection because again that industry really emerged began to emerge the airbnb's pilot program was I believe was the Democratic National Convention a fee from apart from a few trade shows back in 2008 and so you know that was a really amazing industry and government doesn't typically respond to Tech that quickly that is to say that yes you there are not a lot of communities outside of unless you were like a Key West boy this is your old industry and you're trained to regulate this but I think you're in the majority of communities in Florida who don't understand why you're regulate your late early and being told that however you choose to do that whether it's totally obligates or otherwise that that should be defined by the state of you know and I think that there's been the history of Florida on home rule going back to 1968 and the character that it's developed Community to community community to community throughout the states the reason why Anna Maria is different than ballet Beach is different than Juno Beach that's how that evolves but once you make those uniform regulations it makes it a lot more difficult for this place to have quiet charm in this place to be where you go for the resort and so I think you're in the majority of state of cities and or municipalities who would just wish to preserve the status quo of being able to regulate as we see that would you consider a 7-14 faint instead of a solution I'm sorry what I consider what was the verb I think um sorry that that term invokes something else in my mind um I would say that I would consider 714 to be masquerading as something new so all right I'll figure it out that's all I have thank you very much all right let's move on to ivory way Mr Reaper start off with the underground project that you've probably seen we have a whole bunch of conduit roles and conduit play and a city marina on the southern end they're trying to tuck it away for the storage of the project we have all the materials except for the orange conduit rolls which is actually the majority of things to be installed on the project I got a correspondence with the contracts over today notice that it would be delivered this week if so I'll get official you know declaration that they'll be self what they'll be starting I'll pass that along so that's that's exciting because once we have the materials I know they'll get going on it and they'll be moved through rather quickly um the stormwater Improvement projects there was the last meeting we got the note approved to cover the remaining bmps of the stormwater master plan that is an agenda item that is on the regular agenda the children's playground replacement as you can see it's been removed the old playground we actually received 300 for it used playgrounds company actually gave us a check uh the it was good that we removed it because the support pulled out of were very rusted and those couldn't be utilized so they did give us some money for what it was worth of them the new playground should be come in this week and it has a install its installer setup to receive the delivery and they should be able to get it in a pretty quickly so we'll finally get that done um Personnel policy I've gotten that back from the consultant I'm doing some some review and it's answering some questions and then I will pass it along to Mr Mora's legal firm to to review to make sure it's uh where it needs to be as far as employment law goes Grant policy that was on the city manager's goals I would like to bring it to the next work session we're going to add administrative policy if councils did but as a reminder I have the ccma conference to attendance and Memorial Day week which is Tuesday through Thursday so that's May 30th through June 2nd emails on some other notes I made we installed the park mobile system and it's operational during the transition period we put some we shut down the meters the physical leaders and put some signs on it the direct customers to use part mobile and the uh I think I was on Wednesday and then the first weekend we actually we did over four thousand dollars worth of sales so people are using it um the first two weeks I recommend it to the deputies that we do not ticket if they have not paid we got all these little all the cards that was provided by Park Louisville to give them a warning and give them a how-to while you know to ease the transition so uh last week it wasn't a good example I tried to pull numbers on that too I believe we only did about 400 but with the leather explainable so um the staff actually started to remove the physical meters to da from a slab just slide with maroon software fixed so they're trying to come over and create a solution to get that one out of there but I've been in contact with the flobird it was the company that we bought those from and hopefully it was sold back to get some money removed from them um the arpa money we did our first report and we reported the use of this 7 000 or so 753 000 of the 802 am or 2000 so that has been reported the remaining money will go towards whatever more expenses we have in the stormwater account but just to let you know that that has been reported because we have to we'll figure the city with the help of the citizens advisory committee chair Ron saganic is entertaining switching banks to the valley which is over the bridge if you're familiar with before the gas station on the left they're offering 50 bonus points of the target fed fund for the interest which is much better that we're getting from Choice currently with and they're also not going to charge us any any banking fees and we currently you know on a monthly basis you know 100 200 worth of fees that we won't have to pay anymore so Heather and I are going to go to the branch and meet with them on Friday and if everything looks good be asking for signature cards for you guys to the transfer on Earth and we'll do it over time so that um we have a council available transition and um Heather is working on putting the budget together to deliver back to me uh I believe our calendars Thursday the 12th of the 13th but I'd like once I have the budget distributed to you guys and you have some meetings one-on-ones to talk talk it over what I'm planning on doing this year and before we have our first budget meeting to that thanks for the detailed report questions or comments is there a second page to the city managers there you go okay there is no second page this time okay the rest of it was just sort of off yeah um Park Mobile I didn't put it as an actual project and then it was just more reporting an hour what does that sound no that always that was set by resolution right so when uh when we made the transition Department I had it set up with the new fees we have the second reading of the fines for the organ is changing so that if passes tonight will be in effect and then my plan was to actually start ticketing this week after that course I guess a simple question is variety to go to ten dollars does it stay oh I'm sorry the rate change um that is weekends and holidays so Friday is five dollars an hour and then Saturday Sunday and holidays it's agenda I was here to pick up my book Friday night my quick lunch today [Music] thank you whatever it is it might not be a bad idea to have the right to publish on the website okay you know the questions and comments okay thank you very much Mr reefer thank you when I we are up to item nine it's getting alerts reports um this is just a quick recap of April um which seems like so long ago the city yard sale that was you know pretty uh went off really well City attorney Mora gave his government in the sunshine which that was well attended now people were thankful for that we had a flood insurance Workshop that gave up updates on flood insurance here at uh in the council chambers the mayor and Council gave their luncheon to thank all the board committee and Foundation members and the committee members of the foundation and the boards they were all very appreciative and they were very appreciative they expressed that and the audit committee annual comprehensive financial report the final meeting on that should be May 3rd they hope that that will be their final meeting and then the Planning and Zoning comprehensive plan review their final meeting will probably be the ninth and that's that's update any questions or comments for the city clerk all right thank you very much Miss Gentry I appreciate it all right all right up next is item 10. this is consideration of ordinance 23-02 this is the second reading Mr Moore thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-02 the ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida mending section 58-38 finds the procedures to increase the funds associated with parking violations providing for codification severability and for an effective date this has been a second and final reading award is 23-02 by title 11. thank you Mr Mora before we go to the council I would like to open the floor citizen comments are closed before we open discussion I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 23-02 made by Frank Banker do I have a second by Leslie matero Mr Banker do you have it for us was there during the first reading I stated that the current client is only 35 hours and I just noted that we raise important piece I thought it was a price to do with the ten dollars per hour so it made no sense to keep in mind three hours so even though the flags are still a little bit low and light any height I put this motion here I think Mr Baker do we have any other comments or questions all right I'm going to give you one last word if you'd like all right so panning has this ordinance been noticed in obligation yes sir in that case let's take it to about Patty would you please call council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro council member Roberts aye council member stable aye vice mayor Shirley mayor goddess aye to the ordinance passes unanimously all right so now we are on to the consent agenda items 11 313b this is for approval of April 3rd 2013 city council meeting minutes to authorize the city manager to executed their local agreement between Pinellas County and the local governments who are in Cooperative procurement and dental work today bear with me for a few months of disaster debris collection and removal services and disaster degree monitoring and Management Services within Geographic Pinellas County also a proclamation recognizing this week as a 54th annual professional Municipal Clerk's week and a proclamation recognizing the month of May as Lewis Awareness Month all in favor I have any opposed all right the consent agenda passes but I'm going to go ahead and uh I'm going to break out this Proclamation concerning the professional Municipal clerks week because I think we know the wonderful wonderful work and this deserves to be read so even though it's already it's already official I'm going to go ahead and read it to everyone right quick this is Proclamation the 54th annual professional Municipal clerks week it's April 33 through May the 6th 2023. whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk a time-honored and vital part of local government exists throughout the world and whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk is the oldest among public servants and whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk provides the professional link between citizens the local governing bodies and agencies of government at other levels and whereas professional Municipal clerks have pledged to be ever mindful of their neutrality and impartiality rendering equal services to all whereas the professional municipal clerk serves as the uniform or I'm sorry it's the information center on functions of local government and Community whereas professional Municipal clerks continually strive to improve the administration of the Affairs of the office of the professional municipal clerk through participation in education programs seminars workshops and the annual meetings of their state provincial County and international professional organizations whereas it is most appropriate that we recognize the accomplishments of the office of the professional municipal clerk now therefore I Dave Gaddis mayor of the city of Bellaire Beach do recognize the week of April 30th through May 6 2023 as professional Municipal Clerk's week and further extend appreciation to our professional municipal clerk Patricia Gentry and to all professional Municipal Clerks for the vital Services they perform in their exemplary dedication to the communities they refuse in represent dated this first day of May 2023. thank you thank you thank you very much now we are on to I don't know before I'm sorry yes yeah it's okay I like it just a quick comment on the great job our city manager did and whatever he did in our city in the interlocal agreement with Pinellas County and the debrief me now and the reason for that is how important it is if we were to do that on our own I have seen from a history standpoint that regardless of the agreement you may have with companies out there when it comes time even though you have a signed agreement in place they're going to go typically for the highest paid options available the fact that this is with Pinellas County a large much larger group and all the cities that have signed it as well less likely to happen so this is a great idea and I think that positions the city very well for being able to have those Services provided if and when thank Mr Roberts all right we are now on to item 14. this is for authorization to execute and purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated stormwater Master drainage Plan B mediums this was replaced on the agenda by city manager reader Mr Reaper thank you mayor so this is for authorization executive purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated this is to complete the design and Engineering Services for stormwater master plan updated in 2016 on the remaining bmps which stands for the best management practices for the for the drainage program it would be numbers 6 9 10 11 12 13 and 14. IT addresses these streets in those areas which is 9th Street Harbor Drive Cedar Drive Spruce Drive Palm Drive 14th Street 15th Street 16th Street 17th Street 18th Street 19th Street 20th Street 21st Street 23rd Street 24th Street 25th Street and Morgan Drive the amount of the PO to executed is 360 000 and 300 360 374. an hour so a little history like I said the the master drainage plan was updated in 2016. since then there were 15 bmps you prioritized eight of those 15 have been completed the last council meeting on April 3rd we approved the note to provide funding to complete the additional set of bmps um since then I presented the Project's scope to all six engineering firms that we've signed agreements with from our RFQ put out a late December the I told them that at the Timeline I'd like to hit was to have a complete 100 construction plans and technical specifications ready for competitive bidding by August 15th of the sticks I heard back confirmation from four that they could meet that timeline of those four I selected Gemini engineering and Sciences which came out to be our highest range for only RFQ this project is going to include repairing and or replacing stormwater pipes and Inlet structures it's going to replace all the valley Curbing and resurfacing of the payment and on all those streets I mentioned earlier I also have included the lining of the pipe segments from the closest Inlet to the sea wall on 12th Street and 13th Street which is from the last project that was determined that needed to be done in the future better cost line you know pricing I guess I should say for it for doing the lining along with this project because I'm sure there's going to be some more lighting that um it's important to know what the Gemini and engineering and Sciences is going to reanalyze each BMP and design plans to best address the deficiencies that the city has we want to achieve the highest benefit of the cost ratio so the money we put it we want to see the biggest impact I started drafting the work authorization agreement for the school based on the proposal which I've included engineering Sciences I Incorporated proposal the BNP project maps from the stormwater master plan as well as the continuing contract for Professional Services that was signed and the expires thank you for uh for the description of this uh contract and before we go to the council where we need to go to the citizens would anyone like to contact on this project uh Joan hansing 22nd Street I'm assuming that the silver was lying which would be on the south side of the median recently because that's what I they were doing now going back a little bit when they did work back there in Bel Air Island Estates they paved from the bridge to Gulf Boulevard both sides of the medium and I remember having a conversation with Mr Lynn Reeves about the damaged Valley curbing between Bayshore and Gulf but that would be replaced at such time as they got up towards that end of the city I just was glancing through there and I seen nothing that indicates there's any consideration for repairing not repairing replacing damaged without a Curbing and I have a significant amount in front of my property and I'm sure there's others between Bayshore and Gulf so my question is West 22nd Street omended or is it included in this bid so we're still doing we're doing the design phase so that is something that we can look into and if uh um you know well doing the other curving it would be the ideal time to replace what needs to be done there um given that the street is already going to resurfaced um there's going to be an eight yeah I think Miss Transit minister hi I'm Lou Durham again um I don't understand the construction or anything of what you're talking about but I heard 12th and 13th Street still needs something done into seal the huh that's my question anyway so towards the end of the project we did inspections on the pipes that were run between the homes that were we couldn't access the Ontario to the ground in that area and discovered that they're not failing but they are deteriorating and is recommended by the engineer that we get those aligned we felt that during this large project that we have coming up that if we included in the bid we're going to be a competitive pricing ideal pricing for that job so that's that's between the homeowner's property and the new sewers that we put in so these pipes are from the inlets on Bay Drive the ones that are at the end of 12th and 13th Street respectively and they run from those inlets break down property lines to Sea walls so you don't have to pull up the street again do you know it uh they'll go through the manhole it's it's exactly what they're doing to the uh actual sewer system the County's doing right now with those trucks they'll run a cure in place piping through the pipes is there anything that we as homeowners are supposed to do to prepare for this or will we get a notice of some kind or does it matter um we can we will send a notification through our Constant Contact to let you know when they're in the area because typically when we do our stormwater projects we do door hangers to notify all the residents in those areas that you know something's about to occur but I can't say exactly we'll know during the construction phase when they plan on moving over and doing the lining of those streets are we talking years down the hike again or no it'll last uh maybe two days we'll probably move on that the company that did the work on our street just did a superlative job I mean they just they came back they fixed anything that was wrong and they did it in like a record time so I hope that was a bit obviously just surprised to hear there is still anything left to do yeah so it'll be it'll be seamless should take not our days okay and then from there everything will be ready thank you very much thank you thank you Mr any other questions or comments from the assistance all right so before we begin debate on this of authorization to execute the purchase order with Gemini engineering with someone like to make promotion second Terry Shirley vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts you have before thank you mayor I think this is uh the appropriate pattern we're taking which is excellent we're going to add one engineering firm come in and review the dmps that are already in place like a previous engineering firm is that correct in addition to the new areas to be designed so this would be a great opportunity for the city as well as anybody on this Council who wants to be involved to make sure that we review that work with the city manager to be comfortable that the direction that the city is going as Kyle mentioned earlier is the most cost effective process that will be presuming so I think it's a great idea I'm very happy this is the direction you're going and I think it's best for the city thank you for questions I noticed the Geminis at Jacksonville do they have Global offices has seven offices in Saint Petersburg okay not for this project but the way our agreement is set up we can't actually competitively bid Engineering Services because it's uh prohibited by the ccma so I noticed this is [Music] he'll be the principal and I've met his other staff during the uh the RFQ interview processary things about using him he's got staff to support him yes will they also be making recommendations on The Logical order that yes it'll be designed um as best as possible when we lay out the plans I mean it's bid on because um let me check into that because I don't know the extent we can tell the construction company do how that will affect the bidding processing that okay the reason why I ask is I just would hate to attack small problems and be in our best standards to attack the paper colleges first unless they adjust unless it's just this huge financial hurt um so the project construction phase it's proposed to be 365 days we can try to tighten that up when we actually go up to bid the vacation is to get it done as quickly as possible contract if you don't want to do so the exact order again and to talk to the engineer my fear is is we've got these uh this pack of projects in storm season is approaching and there's someone more in me than someone else and everyone if it's not available here any other questions or comments on this no all right so we'd like to point out based on what the marriage has said which is very accurate that we're not asking for the design to be completed by August 15. so for the engineering here the uh the timeline is we're expecting to have everything ready to advertise for bid I in August so that it'll go out we're looking at five six weeks I'm pretty sure we have a lot of videos for that and then um you know tabulations um bring into the universal election I'm hoping construction starts uh late fall right and that's my point of bringing that up so right then the storm season theoretically is done right which would be a great time doing construction standpoint so that when they start the construction what November because the last two years we've had two pretty experience it can happen yeah and the residents have spoke they had the perfect timing when they had their streets done because he was doing the price so November 15th whatever 15th I think we're going to donation is the engineering program going to be coming into any of these New York sessions so we're having to discuss my intention to have them we're doing at least one presentation any other questions or comments and subscribers I'm not an insurance expert but I need to stretch but on the insurance from the engineering firm is there is there any about areas errors and ambition Insurance can be included in the contract with them that they that they have that just in case we went across be beneficial efficiency I can investigate it all the insurance was laid out in the actual rfu agreement contract but I can speak with thank you last call for questions or comments all right Patty Let's uh let's take this too okay this is for authors and authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Inc the storm water Master drainage plan amps council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro council member Roberts council members Abel I vice mayor Shirley I'm mayor goddess hi and so uh thank you all right number 15. consideration of Merit pay increase for city clerk based on annual evaluation criteria placed on the agenda by city manager Mr Reaper thank you mayor um so I put a compiled on the evaluations that were filled out by the council members and did a tabulation of how the scoring turned out um believe we had one you know didn't have every category but I waited out to make sure that we averaged the the overall scoring um to reflect what this country is in our evaluations so I hope in sending that to you it was easily understood if you have any questions please let me know I can answer them all right before we go to the council let's go to Citizens for comments would anyone like to comment in this particular agenda all right back to the council but I'm going to need a motion motion motion name of Frank Banker do I have okay wow all in favor of uh yeah no okay so I'm going to give that one to my change all right Mr Speaker wherever you read that confirmation I don't know five percent's enough [Music] thank you Mr Baker anyone else like the comment yeah right I uh I agree with Mr banker and I think it's well deserved and fully Justified other comments from the council that I'd like to go ahead and call the vote hey all right hey council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes yes councilmember Notaro yes councilmember Roberts aye council member stable I'm vice mayor Shirley mayor Gaddis hi and so it passes unanimously with congratulations Miss Gentry and thank you thank you all very much okay retro to her anniversary date I think that's what we discussed yes yes all right we're all to General business item number 16. do we have any general business thank you okay um since we're doing random orders and chairs around I've uh I've given the computer arrest this month and we're going to begin from my left to right so we'll begin with Lloyd Roberts thank you Mr Mayor so I'm so happy that I got to move to this side now to get those honors I I would like to uh thank our city manager for setting up a meeting with the Pinellas County Traffic Transportation Division I think it went very well they came with two staff members from the county along with their traffic consultant that they've worked with before that we have worked with before the plan the plan is now the consultant is going to go back to the drawing board and gather more data since the last time that they did the study I think it's interesting that the first time they did the study was right around the infamous coping time so we all know that the traffic was significantly impacted by that so I think we'll get some very different numbers when they do the study again the County's picking up the tab for that so we don't have any expenditures for that and I think they're anticipating to come back what was the time frame about constantly I thought they were telling us about three to four months so at that time we'll have a better idea of what some of the options are we regarding what will impact the traffic on Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard as well to be able the goal is to just make it better it's never going to be perfect but I'm confident we can make it better and that's what we take a look at right now so just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on that just a little interesting side note I would have lost a lot of money on this bet we actually had conversations in the meeting about the various crosswalks that we have up here on Causeway Boulevard and Gulf Boulevard I would have bet all the money I have and all the money that Dave has that there were two crosswalks on the north and south side of Causeway Boulevard and there's not there's just one on the north side so my wife and I were walking the beach the other day and we had to cut off sooner than we normally do because of the higher watermarks so there's not one on that side so that's going to factor in I think somewhat come out with regards to what some of our options are to improve the Turning scenarios and the traffic situation there at the intersection of Causeway called Boulevard so that's what we're looking forward to thank you thank you Mr Roberts all right let's uh let's move on to Leslie nutarro the comment s okay we'll be standing in for me at the mayor's Council this Friday because I won't be able to attend I have a prior engagement I'd say charity event and they are they're actually doing a piece online to see some other law so I appreciate you forever one will be happy to see you there all right let's move on to council member Livingstone good evening Patty thank you for all that you do this is your week celebrated thank you we had a wonderful day on Wednesday thanking all of our committee members and it was such a great time so again how do you know you and so much for that together thank you but thank you to all the committee members and the community when you volunteer it it really makes a big difference we truly truly appreciate appreciate it thank you Mr Livingstone all right now Frank thank you our last board session I was directly to my former councilman stepping off with what uh Mr flood flood mitigation working group so I spoke to him and he didn't step for operating income to speak to us at any time we go to flag the city manager will put me away in October 2021 if you remember a former student manager did presentation on FEMA 2.0 I'm sorry so since the beginning of last year I had residents come up to me and tell me geez my foot Insurance doubled okay I have to drop it I don't want to take the words I said in the Scotsman Island he had a hard trust me with the female director I think it was December or November of last year and he says you're putting my constituents at the point right now should we get insurance because of the retirees that live in Florida where you know that's that's the choices they're going to have on top of that our state legislation had an emergency session last year regarded citizens wind and Bill to a ction now says your win policy must be your flood policy so whatever your flood policy says your win policy has to be they also said anything any structures value over seven hundred thousand dollars to replace and not recover so you don't have to go to the private marketing coverage on that so it's just a total mess so I was able to get a three-way conversation from DC and the senator Scott's office here last Wednesday we went over all this and I got another address Friday morning about a resident saying hey my flight insurance I can't afford it at most of them so I got into it I went into Assurance is one of the underwriters for identifying thing and I said I cannot find the discounts that were supposed to get because if you look at 2.0 just the first page of 2.0 will tell you your elevation which is located what most of us will have elevation certificates in any doubt you should get them they'll tell you your highest level in your lowest level and I think on section c let's say this image so I said it's given a 15 discount and the house is four feet above sea level so she says I think the 15 discount is because your city complied with all the regulations in 2021 which I said I think we spent over a million dollars to comply with that entire game it's a 15 discount she says well let me look at it she couldn't find an explanation so then when she started saying about the discounts of you know why isn't there because at one point you should get 10 percent in two foot does she get 20 percent and so on he said why isn't there discounts noted on that should says I think the math formula is this and she says no that doesn't make sense so then she gave me a 400 page manual that FEMA came out with okay I'm explaining discounts so she then told me to contact him which I did they gave me the nfit and I don't want right direction they told me to go to the National flood Insurance Agency they need a toll-free number located in the Philippines she's like this is a joke but it's costing us a fortune so after 20 minutes and I'm not trying to be disrespectful hey explaining what I wanted from this person in the Philippines the name of being I asked to speak to the manager on hold for 15 minutes so I contacted the senator again this morning but this is this is a problem a lot of people especially senior citizens can fix incomes are saying I can't afford to ensure my household okay and plus I'm not able to get it I appreciate I'm just trying to paraphrase all this I'm I'm looking at it I'm working on it I'm trying to come up with it it's a it's completely understandable uh your frustration I sat in several meetings where they were trying to give us some sort of a formula and no one actually knows what what I can tell based upon what I've seen is that this is a wealth tax that they really can't tell you where the extra money is going to or what it's for I I think the goal is is to cover people and put them out those are foreclosed on or sold knocked down and then built up or something else what my name the main concern should be everybody is these insurance premiums go to and I'm talking 10 15 25 000 for a typical home or seven hundred thousand dollars you're not going to find people able to purchase a home and the values are just going to go right before that's with citizens that's not even with the NFL and in most of these products landmarks it's a mess and there is a clean formula 2.0 but nobody wants to apply again to see or hear anything anyone actually explain it confidence just 400 feet and they don't want you to know what that is any other comments Mr Banks I I appreciate all your research all right let's go to Mike's Abel yeah I just thank you to councilman Baker for training down the bottom of that I really appreciate that but other than that I have no comments thank you very much Mr zabel all right let's go to vice mayor Shirley okay so I guess it's uh left of me uh first off uh I'd like to think those who came out and had coffee with a mayor the other morning it was a nice meeting with you and uh and having some interesting conversations I'd also like to command the Miller Beach Community Foundation for their hard work along with all who have volunteered to contribute or contributed to their efforts I'd also like to thank all those who currently serve on a committee or board in Beller Beach it's always safe to just sit at home and complain on social media but it gets very little done instead each of you have done something much braver and requiring far more effort if you have donated your time money and talents to the city you call home on behalf of this Council and City staff I'd like to thank you all do I have a motion to adjourn I should turn promotion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second advice mayor Shirley all in favor aye opposed all right good night everyone"
