    "transcript": "following the immediate initial meeting of the audit committee uh combined with the citizens advisory committee and uh leslie the tarou from council is joining us we'll call the meeting to order president we have leslie notaro goldman john hanson jody shirley and rob rusberg he's on the line right you hear us rob yes if you speak up a little bit easier but i have heard everything so far okay so um i guess first rule of business is to select a chair of the audit committee yeah that has to be selected by the verb i have a question about that if you look at the resolution that formed the citizens advisory committee and you look at it further and then you look at this resolution to form the audit committee it says that the advisory committee is the audit committee plus one plus one council member but it also says you have to select the chairman for the audit committee i mean you're going to meet his place that's the i've been yeah i mean last night there was some discussion i think i had you know with patty before the meeting and i said this doesn't really seem to make a whole lot of sense that we have to have a another call it an audit committee when we are the audit committee and then election of a chair when we already have a chair of the committee right but the ordinance says that so we just have to do it because this committee as it is now really only meet a couple times you guys will be leslie won't be part of it this is only for the selection of the audit auditor that's that's what it's for it's a requirement of the statutes now okay and there's there's nothing to say that the chairman of the audit committee can't be the chairman of this committee or a chairman of the advising committee well in my simplistic fresh now it's split can i ask a question hey rob go ahead speak up yeah are we permitted to make a motion that says that the current chairman and secretary and vice chairman of the advisory committee be appointed as the same positions in the audit committee yes you are did you just make that motion i'll second it so seconded all in favor aye aye aye any opposed okay okay that was made by robert i have a cheat sheet here for uh doing minutes now patty fix you up okay all right so i'll continue uh in the role as chair of the audit committee and so our next uh business item is to review the written proposals uh that we received for uh the request of the rfp is we all got those in advance uh proposals were from wells hauser and schotzel and um so uh ron before we go we have to back up we have to include the agenda and i'll make a motion to be true gentlemen okay gotcha all in favor aye opposed and before we get into the discussion of the merits of either of the application of the responses i needed a little clarification on how the accounting is being handled for the city internally outside of the audit process because i didn't know if we were still farming that out the subcontractors and does that firm part of the subcontract include the preparation of the documents that we furnish to the auditors for them to review yes and uh what's we have the name of that name for of the subcontractor that's going on andy tess cpa yeah he's not like we used to have melanie i want to understand he's the charter officer so he's a subcontractor serving as treasurer right and preparing yeah heather's the one who's here most of the time excuse me someone's on site constantly uh two days a week mark i noticed in the notes that we use quickbooks for the city to run the finances on and so i guess they provide access to folks [Music] all right so when i've looked at the rfp we've got our grading sheet on it but in the in the actual rfp that we sent we had a list of proposal requirements and the responses were supposed to follow in order of the proposal requirements and how they presented it so i don't know do i or we just have an open discussion so yeah i look it looked like everybody followed the order um the only thing i noticed on the whns is that they were supposed to provide emails to their references and there were no emails of those references then also the proposals were supposed to note quote sealed proposal i saw that the salt marsh node seal proposal on the pricing sheet but maybe it was an envelope yeah it was both were in the ceiling and we opened them when the things were uh so so this this thing was sealed when we got both of them okay they were separate envelope they had these uh in there and then they had separated boards separate and local pricing so i don't know if it could be able to i'll have to be happy to continue talking about my just share our thoughts i have a question before we get into the sharing our thoughts did we get any uh feedback from any of the references that either one of these bidders provided us did we directly call them no because the first process really is for the audit committee to rank them and then at the ranking uh if you want that we'll we'll get some feedback that's not a problem i will tell you just so you're aware sarton salt marsh has been our auditor for long as i can remember uh and their their pricing came in it matched what it's been is the last 10 years and the wells housers uh schatzel it is an auditor has many other cities also and uh i mean they're a good firm uh actually they were the auditor where i worked in oldsmar so uh you know i'm familiar with them but you know yeah i was gonna say i noted that they had a lot of piercings you know like ballet okay so we we got their references but we haven't reached out to any of the references i understand thank you no the other thing i noticed in our general information we didn't talk about the bond issuance i'm not sure if whs has that information if they understand the bond issuance we did in the um for the undergrounding and you know that adds another level of accounting i mean we talked about the storm water recruitment you know fees and things like that actually you say that cost of stormwater so we kind of misstated some things in our in our general information so i think that maybe leaves us with some additional accounting process charges hours yeah this year oh you mean because of the stormwater they were aware of the three funds basically the marina fund the stormwater fund the general fund so they they were all aware of that because uh there were a few questions but he didn't talk about the bond issuance i mean i think that's kind of adds well if they would have pulled last year's audit they would be in there i would have assumed that they would have pulled at least a couple i mean i know that salt marsh is aware of it i was saying i don't know comparing apples to apples if they weren't they haven't been intimately involved with what's going on with bellar h do they know that you know and and does that open us up to more costs because maybe it wasn't abolished in general information it's just a caution yeah everybody get a chance to see um john's good comments even though he's an advisor for excuse me alternate yes what were these this was just emailed there's an email at leslie that patty said today oh yeah john hayes our alternate formerly worked in public accounting to take a look and provided some notes that we all received i agree with many of his comments that we have used the salt marsh firm jenny bittinger janine bittinger for years um and they have gotten us the the what's the highest rating the kafra you know they've been very successful for these years and i don't believe that i know since i've been around i've never had any issue with anything they have ever done but they they are a statewide firm whereas the other protests be born locally and they've got a great book of clients in the municipal business space government space they are private where they go to firms throughout the state when it comes to municipal government audits so when you're safe they both are very impressive i mean they both responded to the rv very well yeah i don't i mean they it really boils down to talks too when i'm looking at this they both have great references i mean maybe we could call them and ask more information but i mean both firms have been around for a while both responded appropriately i can't pick one apart over the other except for the money that's the only thing yeah and when you're doing these types of honesty as most audits you all they all have to follow the aicpa standards and they have to meet those standards and prove that they've examined everything to those levels so it's not like oh i'm going to look at this very carefully or i'm not going to look at this they're obligated to meet those standards and we whoever we award this did do or suggest that we were ordered to has to meet those standards and will be held to those they both provided peer reviews at that state that they meet their standards and exactly i think the leslie's point here the gfoa certificate of achievement for excellence and financial reporting salt marsh has led us there last four years well actually salt marsh just took over two years ago it was they was called somebody else davidson and christine they bought them out and that that was our auditor but the salt marsh is a much larger company and they bought their their business out a lot of their employees went with them and you know i will say we we've never had any issues with the audit and giving it to us on time you know we have a kind of a timeline that they have to put it they've met it thus far so full of finance numbers it looks like three years ago they were 22.5 a year and then the last two years they dropped it to 17-5 what drove the reduction of these was that i don't remember i'd have to go pull the old contract but i don't remember it being 22. i i just saw that i didn't pull up the budget okay and it had the 18-19 year was 22-5 it lined is for the auditor yeah okay so there could have been something there what was going on yeah because i know the last maybe we expected it to go up yeah well like in the budget that i'm giving you because i want to try to schedule another meeting for to look over the budget i put 25 000 in there because i didn't know what it was going to cost but once we get there then i'll adjust it accordingly because that was just as a placeholder the budget versus what we pay yeah are not necessarily the same thing and then the salt marsh you know clearly has a leg up because they know us right they know they're familiar with the city they're familiar with the county veterans right i surmise a decision here so is it absolutely necessary based on our conversation that we have to score them based on what we're i think it's a good idea to do it because that's what we said we were going to do okay uh and you know you've got it this conversation is going to go i mean we have somebody who has been with us for a few years and has gotten us this award so like jody just said they have kind of a lego and the price is right yeah and they i will say salt marsh being a company you know a more i'll call it state company that's what well called statewide yeah i think that's beneficial because you're going to get more opportunity i i you know wells and hauser i know them they they're they were good auditors also for the city of baltimore and they've been with them for well i know at least 25 years and a lot of times auditors they don't even go back out for an rfp they just but the console asked me when the contracts were up to do an rp so you know that's what we did i thought we would get a couple more but we really did wait because you put it out to six didn't you yeah and we didn't uh we had one other firm that asked a few questions but then they opted not to do anything i think it was called brian if i remember right they opted based on mr handsome hanzo survives here um i guess the art of sporting is what we need to do i was just trying to skip a step well to be fair there's a challenge and i assume that they get to the bidding firms get to look at the results yeah it's public that's probably better you do i guess so what will happen after you do your scoring we'll collect the sheets stolen and then you'll make a motion too can you make me copy this i love playing at home yeah oh is this one is this what we're filling out here no well okay this and then we'll take those totals and add them out to get a school and then whatever this the number one rank card score is then you'll need to make a motion to recommend that with this content yeah well that's because there's five of you when i asked her to do that i was so you only need to put one in there and put your name on it so we have that hey lynn yes a couple of things so specifically for this scoring system my first question do you want me to give you my scores verbally right now over the phone so somebody can record them or if you are having everybody fill out a sheet and turn it in you just want me to fill this thing out and email it back to you uh if you want to just give me your scores i'll i'll write them down on the sheet i have and then we'll go from there okay good uh my second question was on the scoring itself just so i understand so just for example in the first category qualifications experience expertise total of 45 points so we could award up to 45 points to both of the bidders yes is that right yes we don't split those points no it's not like you can give 35 for one and 10 for somebody else no okay good thanks oh okay rob are you ready with your numbers i am okay i'm gonna pick you up off the speakerphone okay go ahead okay okay okay okay okay okay i've got your number so i'll put you back on the screen i do this right you there rob yes okay yeah oh i already started put names across for everybody [Music] well it is the emails and the references so what do they lose [Music] is [Music] okay 45 yeah yeah you just worry about what your one box yeah just one mop yet for you yeah you been in orlando you've been in orlando i went i was there for a couple days [Music] i drive there back three hours each way in a day okay it's just hard just tear that page up is i think you there's only 30 possible points there i've got my totals down there for you but i guess behind they're about a year behind schedule that overcost i think and they've told everybody that's it there is no more whitening about fourth from downtown [Music] my personal physician is over at florida hospital downtown and when my wife worked there she was in medical graduate medical education and oversaw residency programs there because they're a teacher hospital and i think the head of the surgical education musician i tried that twice a year okay i make an appointment with him early enough for the day and the same day i make one with my urologist so that i can keep up with my prostate if i get for a number of years before i went into the office and became a manager so often you don't know i was retired from the navy i tried my hand to run my own business woodworking and it didn't work so well so i went to the state and i said well we got money through the va for uh i opted to be a commercial truck driver because i could not pitch myself going around fixing copy machines those are the only two things you can get retrained for so i took the cdl there is no amount of money in the world today that you could pay me to get behind one of those big rigs with all the hard enough french idiots on the highway and everything they do and the things i saw then were bad all right so we've got lynn's total it all up with all of us here tonight so the total for salt marsh is 511 points the total for whs is 457 so it's if we're going to recommend salt marsh as the auditor i'll make that make it official i'll make the motion uh because they want one what would you say sauce numbers were 5 11 5 11 okay wells 457 thank you all right wait a second yeah nelson marks okay so we have completed uh the choice of auditor that will recommend the city council and then they get to make the final decision and so the next item is general business i've given you the draft budget it's still in draft uh i gave it to the city council last night and i'd like to try they're they're going to have a work session on the 21st and i'd like to try to schedule a meeting with the advisory committee before that if we can if you're available to do that and you know i'll just go through it with you and explain everything and i don't think it'll take us you know it's it's pretty self-explanatory if you look at it when you say our work session is the 21st yeah so so that would just be us leslie doesn't have to play this right because she's got the work section right so you want to explain i'd like to spend an hour hour and a half and go through it and let you but i want you to take it home look at it and then if you've got questions and as i go through it then i can answer it so i guess what i'm asking is are you available next week tuesday i say it's the worst day of the week for me but that's more important i don't need to go there okay got it and i i don't know where rob's at i am available um monday evening or tuesday evening next week or friday so 14th 15th or 18th okay so johnny out of town or alternate but the yeah five of us again yeah go through it you know and if you've got questions just these are copies we need to advertise this that give us we'll we'll yeah 14th at 6 o'clock yeah yeah the 14th at 6 o'clock okay monday yeah okay and uh i'll have patty email it to you rob okay can i also come by and get a hard copy yeah whenever you're back in town you just come or we can get it to you i'll get it to your house that's why yeah i'll be back uh thursday morning so i can come by okay that's fine okay anything in the budget the only things that that really will stand out in there the sheriff is asking for a three 3.63 increase next year there is a placeholder in there depending on if the governor signs it because there's a needs analysis for stormwater that the senate there's a senate bill and we don't actually know what the cost but i put a 30 000 placeholder in there this house and senate passed a bill in the state legislature if the governor signs it we're going to be required to do a needs analysis on our storm water and infrastructure for 20 years out so it's going to require an engineering firm and you know it's a it's it's a big cost that you know i don't think a lot of cities have planned for the state's going to provide funds for that right no no no no it's gonna be ours you can't elevate it i know but but there's a requirement to give the department of economic opportunity a report by next january 20 i think it's 23. did the city not already have something down that line when during the whole [Music] well we did but not to the elevation that they're asking what they're asking is uh they're wanting us to do a needs analysis as far as funding how we're going to pay for it what the long term cost is going to be and so it's more detailed and i'm hoping the governor vetoes it because all it is is an additional cost to cities i mean indian rocks beach is an example he's expecting it's going to cost his city a hundred thousand dollars you know so they were pretty far down the road with some of that so we could bring in yeah so and you know it's just a it's it's another reach a mandate that the legislature has put on all cities so it's a difference if you look at these expenses that are new but then i gotta think that with all the new transactions and towers could increase on revenue our our ad valorem uh increased 6.03 percent which is about i think it's 69 000 that's the increase if we leave the millage rate as it is i will tell you that we're not sure when we're going to get it but we're going to get some funding from this american rescue plan it's not in the budget because i got estimates but they haven't told us and it's going to funnel through the state which typically the state doesn't get it to us as fast as we'd like but i sat in on a webinar yesterday and supposedly after the state gets the money they only have 30 days to give us our portion and it will be in cash so it means for infrastructure in particular storm water can be used for it can be used for sewer it can be used for revenue we lost which in our city we we lost rental revenue and we lost some parking revenue but for the most part we didn't lose much so you know you could say you know if you want to go that route but i mean i would suggest to the city council that we use that for storm water if the funding is there yeah and they're going to give [Music] there's a right now they're saying we have till 2024 to spend the money something unique about the money when we do get it there we can put it in the bank and draw interest on it which yeah well thank well you much but you know that when i saw this when i saw this webinar yesterday when i saw this webinar yesterday in it the slide popped up i was like what you're gonna they're gonna give us this cash where in the past what you had to do you had to spend it and then you get it well this is in reverse and uh uh our rough number estimate is like 607 thousand but i don't know if that's uh factual yet these are just numbers that were thrown out that's it that's a good chunk of chance yeah yeah that would move some a lot of stormwater projects to the head of the west and on this the stormwater the thing you mentioned about if he's if the governor's side is possibly having to do much further timeframe from expectations is is that all engineering costs pretty much that needs analysis would be an independent 20 years yeah to define right and that was most of the most of the cost yeah yeah it's it's it's an engineering operation yeah so he's going to help out a lot of engineers if he signs it so some other things in the budget we we have uh gulf boulevard money for the underground utilities this year we got 256 000 next year we're going to get 676 000 from the county uh this is a penny for vanilla penny for pinellas money it can only be used for underground utilities on gulf boulevard overall we're going to end up with about 2.9 million uh there is 1.1 million from belarus shore that in the past it's we've used it and i'm going to approach them about leave it because that's what the agreement says fellow beach could use it but i don't in the current situation i think i need to ask them to clarify yeah do you have a proposed strategy for what goes next uh well we pretty much got the west side of it done except for little spectrum areas which is about 60 thousand dollars which i'll be bringing to the console this year because we have penny three money that is going to expire in september i've got about 60 000 left so i'm going to use it so whatever i can and then the 256 from this year will just roll over because the initial number i got from duke was 5.5 million and the initial number yeah and the initial number i got from spectrum to finish the balance of the city is about 190 000. so but i went back to duke and told them i well i'll tell you what i told them i said is this april fools because they told me on april 1st this summer and i said you need to come back with something else because i want it separated and i explained to them that they were encroaching into some neighborhoods that were not part of the gulf boulevard stuff so they've got to clean that up and they charge me for some crossings which if you look now there's not much duke left and hopefully my spectrum told me today the end of this month or yeah they said a month so i'm thinking the end of the month first week of july from first through 12th you won't see any wires going across gulf boulevard and then they're going to start the rest of the city so the only wire that for the most part that's left is the cable wire that's going across cold boulevard and that will be underground so and this is that uh frontier doesn't have anything above ground anymore so uh and and i had asked them if they did but they don't they told me they had a little bit in bellevue island estates and but and i think they had a little bit when we looked at harrison there's so much cable down on our stream so they just haven't but the goal is to underground the east side and put those because those are really the transmission lines that are beating both sides of the road so we can get it in the number and put our own conduit in i there's a possibility we will be fine but we'll have to wait and see what that number comes back because based on what's spectrum told me about percent of the uh cost is the boring and i think i can do better with going to somebody like you know pouring out like i didn't like mark porter or something and say hey i want you to run this project tell me what you can do to shoot these conduits down the street cool these funds from that american rescue plan we should probably put their factual time well it doesn't doesn't offer that at this point and and we'll get more detail once they really figure out how they're going to do it i got an email just before i came in here that i've got to give them some numbers so they can calculate our real number so but in either way i think there's some infrastructure benefit that we can get you know if it's storm water and storm water take advantage of it you know so uh other than that there's three percent increase for the employees not really any major projects other than the stormwater project for next year in the budget every year we save money for you know as an example uh we put money aside for paving or we put money aside for the beach accesses this year we got 50 000 from the county to to do the crossovers so it only cost the city half that uh we've got some money in there for a dock on 7th street because it's deteriorating but at the same time and there's money in there for sea walls and things of that nature but we our big sea walls we've taken care of already majorly i mean we took care of harrison we took care of belle isle so now what we've got is the little pocket park sea walls and you know when we do something like a dock project we'll probably do that sea wall at the same time and you know why advice spend more money and tear up something twice so but we'll go over that and i'll just kind of highlight the things and we'll go go through it if you've got any questions write them down or if you've got a question you want answered before then just call me okay so we'll meet the 14th and 6 o'clock here to review that with any other uh questions or the business that being that he wants to discuss not get a motion for germany all in favor all right any opposed great thanks everybody thanks rob thanks rob"
