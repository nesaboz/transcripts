code enforcement report and thank you thank you yes sir thank you Commissioners mayor City officials and residents The Clapper for the record uh as you see in front of you the monthly report from code enforcement you'll notice that our weed and grass and overgrowth has raised a little bit but we are taking care of that and our impermanent work as a garage happy to see that it's down to 7.5 out of a percent out of the circle there been doing a lot of follow-up working with a lot of the residents on the overgrowth of weeds and instructions on the roadways I've been in contact with the city manager also and give the guidance direction to help go along with that we still have a few problems along the boulevard that we are working with student energy and contract trying to get around utilities other than that that's it for my report I'll stand for any questions Council if you have any questions for the day thank you very much thank you I appreciate you hey YouTube um while we are discussing the police the police report I do have a question for City management do you know what the current procedure is for parking and creation this is where I'm going what I've noticed is that settling the bridges and the shoreline anywhere where there's non-homes has become free fishing and I have yet to see anyone Patrol and I've I've actually rolled down my window and said hey you might want to you might want to reconsider doing that because they do patrol around here look an hour later and they're not cleaning Mr verified we addressed that on the fourth I was out I didn't catch several people uh out on the bridges they were parked and felt they could be there they can't park there one of them was up on Harrison we had to move over to the marina as far as Park fishing on the bridge there's not really much we can do about that because it's considered open Waters but if if somebody parks on the roadway I get an opportunity to move if they don't we're going to cite them and move them anyway this is one individual that was part of Harrison went to the marina didn't pay ended up getting a 55 fine anyway so um but I am I am monitoring any type street parking like that for anybody who is not doing any type of work in the residential areas okay and just for clarification I don't have a phone station off the bridge it's the parking at the entry or exit time and it's happening constantly kind of uh wondering if you see it your neighborhood also see it still on here so because I know I know someone who adopted so they were part that um Park areas or you know where they where they carved and they were Partners so I know that the sheriff was doing their job when it comes to that but you know along with that I think about my favorite camp on Harrison because I'm sure they were standing there if you're fishing so yeah issue but and also at Bayside Park too and providing a lot of citations out there for the same thing so they're just pulling in there not pain and they're going out here all right and um is there a better number of them a permanently on hold phone line um what I can do is I will get uh Joe and David's cell phone numbers so we've been we call them directly because they do not mind having that happen and they just have code on it when it does happen say that I've been giving out myself whatever so if there is an issue I will go check on it um but I will address this to a sergeant stiver to make sure that we get it under the line I appreciate it thank you very much yes sir any other questions or comments all right let's move right on to item number four uh is Davidson here tonight to presenting for the vanilla Suncoast fire and the rest of the preschool district all right we just made a ride on that item number five a presentation before I call Mr Davis to the podium it's important to know why he is receiving this award since 2000 and possibly earlier Rudy has served Belair beach in various capacities including serving on the steering committee that made recommendations to the council to replace our aging City Hall he served on the citizens advisory committee it worked closely with Pinellas County to agree on the design for the Bel Air Causeway Bridge he served as president of the Bel Air Beach resident agreement that form a pack and brought the council manager form of government to referendum he served as the first mayor of Miller Beach in the new Council manager form of government during that term the elected to move forward with the construction of our community center he served as a member of the board of adjustments he served on not one but two city manager search committees he also served as Vice chair of the planning and selling board I could keep going but I'm pretty sure that everyone here gets my employee now I'd like Rudy Davis to join me at the coding thank you Mr Vegas to give you this distinguished Services we are very proud of all your accomplishments thank you very much thank you thank you for your goddess final four members of Sydney staff I sincerely appreciate this recognition of my service to the city of Miller Beach it has been my pleasure and privilege over the years to work with so many dedicated residents the lifestyle that we enjoy while working on various committees boards and special projects over the years some of the most satisfying with confluences accomplishments I've been serving as the president of their father Refuge residence group before it worked from a practical manager for the governor for referendum the subsequent approval by the voters of our city serving as mayor during the transition into the secure profession that's more professional form of government continues to serve us throughout the day and most recently to help organize the campaign to defeat the mayor who would be king I always felt like the 73 years of Valor Beach Medical members before me that service to our city was fully compensated for by the opportunity to maintain and protect what we have within this law of an amazing community and I never wanted a salary equipment work if maybe if I were here for the money I was here for the wrong reason because I think behind public service to attend other matters or require my full attention I do want to alert our residents to what our city council operating those there's a serious challenge the ballet beats in all cities of Florida by the current Florida legislature in Tallahassee they went to end whole room that was mandated by Florida voters in a 1968 referendum their objective is to take away a local municipalities ability control what happens within a total borders and take that power to Tallahassee so they can serve the winning special interests who don't want you and need telling them what they can't do in our town our own local local state center Paradise Segway was the sponsor of the bill that would take away our grandfather's Life to Live at short-term limits and our local state representative Tim Burkey of whether it has supported that measure of the house really good custom to either change interviews and support public or face removal from office by local voters who put the mayor and Council should take a very proactive stance for retain your authority of local matters and our residents report their support their evidence to do so for Tallahassee will soon take that right away from us we should all actively support the local the local voices United project sponsored by the Florida League of cities I asked Council to make sure every resident is aware of the project and how it sorts supports our life for self-determination familiar Council the city staff I thank you again for this recognition they wish you and all of the rest of our beach the very best thank you all right we are on to item number six which is quarterly one first place let's begin with the board of adjustments report from Mr Mike Kelly Mr Kelly you have the board thank you Mr Mayor I appreciate the opportunity to tell you the board of adjustment has been busy before we just normally we see students is a year we've had two this quarter and we're supposed to have one this Thursday but we postponed it so we have active board we've had the same three kind of vacations that have come before us regarding polls um counselors will get a plan to make them get renewed and I'm sure everything will work out just fine but again again an active board we're getting a lot of experience for the new members and if there's any questions I'll be letting them to handle them this time thank you Mr Kelly do we have any questions or comments you know I think you guys are doing a great job and I'm hoping we can get this forward absolutely so thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen all right now we are on to the citizens advisory committee report from Mr Ron scanning thank you mayor council uh citizens advisory committee that this uh past quarter under our other title as the audit committee and we approve the file uh comprehensive annual financial report on May 3rd and uh it's the council Improvement that they have picked some errors of all the reports that were missing so I will be meeting later this week to review the budget thank you do we have any questions again all right next up is the Park and Recreation report from this again um just a couple things from the park and record once again I'd like to thank all of our B cleanup volunteers over the last quarter um we are looking at new items to put Beller Beach logo then I like the table class but um so if anybody has any suggestions please contact anyone on the park and ride border please call a city We are continuing our new welcome back program for new residents along with all the necessary information that they need as new residents um they also we also include some Bella Beach goodies and some local Merchant info if you as a resident own a local business would like to contribute something to the bag please drop off at the city map matches of 10. the UC City website or RV sign for upcoming fall and spring events our third annual health and wellness fair is in January and we would love to have more resident participation as vendors if you're in the health and wellness field thank you if you have any questions or questions uh the last Beach cleanup there was a couple residents that crazy issue where you can reach more often and I know you were traveling last monthly meeting I did bring it up Kyle to go to look into it it's not much anymore but um yeah that's great I don't I know like there's a schedule that the city maintenance team has to to rape the beach are you looking for the park and ride to maybe get volunteers to do that I'll borrow too but I don't know about the limitations or you know someone getting hurt or I'll drive the track now I did I did contact Auto permit and they said that we have more and get more frequency you know and sometimes you know during the busy season we by the time of materials are clear on the beach people out there so you can't get involved to begin around possession yeah but we can do I'm not sure what our goal is on how many how frequently we would like to do it um limitations for volunteers I know when you're ready I guess a dump truck to take away waste say can we put residence on that there are no insurance coverage holders that's what I thought it to me it seems like it would be difficult because we don't always know when the beach needs to be rigged just based on when there's like something like a big coming in out of the water so like you know I know it's scheduled but if I don't know we can have maybe something on a call but like that we could do through the city without trying to get groups of volunteers because we can't always do that on short notes anyway we have to sign a waiver sity participated a handle piece of Hardware but uh music we used to do this regularly I don't think it was on a regular scale I think I think oh why didn't we stop um the last two times we get hit when the weeds were accumulating on the beach since I've been here since 18 uh our permit's been filled out for triangularly and after major storms so um typically what happens is a residents will report affordable schedule any other questions or comments thank you all right and finally we have the Planning and Zoning report from Mr JC Mr Mayor vice mayor council members 3221 at best prescribe East representative the zoning board has matched several times since first of the year it's not important it just sits and looks around sometimes we look around and wonder why we got certain things but we got the comp plan and just as a for instance we spent four meetings on the comp plan and return it to the council and talk about five hours two two one and one and this is times that the citizens to both and we presented that back to the city and recently we were presented an ordinance considering signs and it's only this thick and when you go through this I'm wondering whether it belongings with the zoning board because most of it I am through college degrees but one of them is at law and most of these presentations early release and we're not attorneys and I would like to ask the council to reconsider putting this towards the board for our consideration because one of his first reviewed by us there were a ton of questions someone knew the answers to but the the neophytes on the board did not understand a lot of the verbage so I don't believe that belongs to it on board it was referred back to the attorneys and we proceed from there I'd like to thank Patty for helping us out for advancing and the city manager is always there and Randy and we're a silent board but we do get our job done and we know that the city and all you people do a big job too and the people behind me that show up they do a big job and I lost remember just they didn't die but they might as well Rudy ran away from me this year call and on the right side of me we have been on boards together for the last 28 years and then another person resigned and we got new ones they are not familiar but if we keep trucking along to get our reports but some of these things should be reviewed before they're Dunked On Us are there any questions that any lovely people then I uh I would like to make a comment first uh I think that there was probably a little bit of miscommunication of what we were looking for from planning and sewing we certainly I hope I'm speaking for the entire Council we're certainly we weren't looking for legal advice and unfortunately I'm afraid that that's what was interpreted whenever it made made its way to Planning and Zoning we received numbers that were highlighted and uh it was it was our job to kind of live through it and make some recommendations pitch into planning and zoning and see if you agree you and your the other members agree I don't know how we went down this rabbit hole but that I don't think that's what we were looking for I do appreciate your effort and your time and I I apologize on behalf of the council for the miscommunication I think maybe the next time we pitch something to any one of these uh boards or committees we need to make sure that it's clear and fully understood as what we expect with any council member like to make a comment on what I just said foreign six items to 40 pages to that new design ordinance um Justice paid in I don't want to Discord but she says this will come back to court one day all right when they because we've got some alarms from residents but I think the Old Law uh an old city manager who handled it Mars beautiful Whenever there was a problem this man right here I think has the same ability to handle it I think we should trash it but I sympathize with the whole board and even address it thank you very much I am uh I'm I'm not going to waste Mr trashy time to try to explain why as things have changed over time that we have to become more uh protective of our liabilities and I think that that was the original reasoning for even altering our sign policy all the way around uh again on behalf of the council I apologize for apology is not necessary it's just a matter of communications everything's accepted you hit your job we have ours and I appreciate it I I do have a question for you uh now that we know what the actual task is uh does uh Planning and Zoning have enough energy to review a copy that has the numbers that we that we inserted showing distances thicknesses Heights because it's not it's not terrible but I would feel like a second opinion on it I understand I'm looking for a yes or no I didn't quite understand the question you don't know I would like it I would like to pitch it back to you again but this time highlight every number where it's feet inches so that you have something tangible to look at instead of Legally speaking if it's shorter than 45 pages it will be 45 pages but all you have to do is look for the yellow where it's highlighted you know it should be pretty straightforward and if we put little marks on the side saying something that each translations I think we can handle that we okay we were just looking for another group of citizens absolutely so that we can say that the council did not dictate safe size height with weight Etc that's what I tried to say if you're nervous of what we came up with half well more than half 95 percent of this was passed by the legislature in Tallahassee so we've been doing environmentally correct and so anything that could not yes thank you so it's Mr NFL I appreciate you told me JC everybody else any other questions or comments for JC no thank you so much for your report thanks have a good night all right and Mr reefer if you track down that copy that's got the highlighting on it and make sure that they did copy of it yes what I gathered from the meeting was about because the amount of pages the language is they felt that it was a tough to understand and they were worried that the average resident trying to follow the code for administration so it was left for Mr Moore on to try to streamline it made it easy to understand okay is he working on that house okay so whenever that happens it needs to come back to us first right okay thank you very much all right now we are on to number seven of the City attorney report contract from trash Daniel is filling in for Mr Moore tonight Mr trash do you have the Lord thank you I did speak to Randy he said that although he has been talking to you about the adopters Saturday he just wanted you to know that he will be working on ordinances of pregnant ordinances and direct response to that bill which has not become that was the only updating all right thank you very much any questions for Mr trash all right thank you very much now we are on to number eight the city manager's report this week for you thank you Mary I'll start off with the underground project uh we actually started construction phase today uh for the conduit going on the ground on phase one and as a reminder that events from 28th Avenue south southern jurisdiction of the city up to Causeway Boulevard uh and then moving on the utility Consultants of Florida are working on uh acquiring the easements and final design for phase two the stormwater projects we are currently got about half the streets survey but coming in as they come into Gemini engineering they're being designed and um the Georgia ship and Associates is planning on they're finishing up the survey so in a matter of Imagine two or three weeks a personal policy manual continue to work on this received the City attorney comments back from Mr shinfeld he promoted a lot of good insight and a lot to our personal policy man yoga was missing bringing them to a good legal status and we did a little history looking into some of the coordinates that were referenced in the previous documents and it's been in the past with Personnel policy that the city has passed it by ordinance so in order to make our revision legal we need to pass an organs in which I have which are more of drafting at this point hopefully in August would be my first reading and that what that'll do is it'll sort of supersede all the previous ordinances and allow us to whenever we amend the policy manual um I would like to bring up a in our budget Workshop we discussed for a City Patrol boat for code enforcement from the water something has come up this past week where some of our Waterway markers were already experiencing issues with the big Clearwater Harbor another use that kind of Handy to us I just wanted to bring that up good news this week the the ongoing Code Enforcement issue with a tree I have a scheduled to meet with an arborist I have permission from the property owner to go on the private property and we're going to the sterile analysis of that tree we had yeah and then as I can come back up to the top project which is our 2023-24 budget we have our next budget Workshop coming up on tonight so to after that we were on top we tended to the military tonight in our last budget Workshop Community we said that tonight we would make a decision on the waste collection services on whether we are like we negotiate with recent individuals our current contract that is expiring the end of September or uh if we're going to advertise an RFP for those services uh over the weekend that provided you with some documents of some information that was gathered in the past a week and a half or so um first document kind of laid out the price increases the rate increases that we've experienced in our current contract provided a document from Waste Management that summarized all the cost increases in the different areas of the third Waste Management business there was a document on the recent Florida Municipal big results across the State of Florida from 2019 to this current year showing you know the different contracts that went out to RFP and were awarded who they are awarded to what the First Dimension increase was per her Municipality of different outdoor FP and this this uh the percentage of an increase compares to their services directly to their previous contracts so as you know every city is different the contracts are different so the best way to prepare is that and lastly I prepared I did a lot of research working with the county on our our Utility Billing how it's set off how it's built through the multi-family dumpsterious principle that family can't in the single family residence I try to lay out where we currently at a bi-monthly billing is in the utility gold all the other coming utilities and how that covers our revenue from that how that covers our current contract and what we were looking at as far as a rate increase for a future contract if the proposed or the estimated I should say increase of 25 percent that's all I have I just want to believe that that decision worker all right you have any questions for the city manager yes Mr Roberts so excuse the cloud so with regards to the waste management contract situation if the city wants to go out to and use a request for a proposal do you need a decision on that tonight to tell what I'm hearing it would be preferable the last time we did an RFP uh was was advertised on June 22nd of the contract of the Year expiring and they perceived the bids on July 24th so we're a little bit behind that schedule I was told by Mr Moore that our RFP schedules is aggressive per um what he experiences in other cities but I do think it's doable we've done it in the past so I propose that if we do RFP we can advertise by July 26th and receive the bids on August 29th leaving enough time to bring it to the September regular meeting okay is that something we need to to vote on I make a motion that we put an RFP out you don't have to all we're doing is looking for the bench right now opposed to me we have to leave waste management and and every time before we before we do that I just kind of one question what was your thoughts on the data that was asking you look at all in the data how did you feel about the price increase when I compared it to the other uh we just validated cities counties that went out to RFP the data shows that the uh the awarded contracts are coming back higher than the proposed estimator renegotiated rehabilities management my biggest concern is that we go out to RFP and we side that we want to Circle back to release management but at that point we're actually being more of the same services fair enough what I'd like to hear out of your mouth what your recommendation is to things based on the numbers figures um being with our municipalities and also speaking of municipalities who aren't satisfied with their service after they've changed would be the sticker ways to have their group looking at the history of the services to our residents we've been with them for a long time and I know there's a very positive relationship with our residents I rarely hear any problem if there is a problem police management response immediately and addresses the problem so in my my time is management even in my previous position I've been very satisfied with tissue Bankers after hearing his comments about this are you still need to make the motion for RFP well I don't think an order of Peace would have hurt paid so it Council doesn't want to tell someone to stick with the hiring we didn't come back with any it was going to make minimal difference to remove the holidays um I just would like to make a point that in my meetings with Waste Management if they renegotiate they estimate 25 increase what they're saying is if we go out to RFP they are based on the numbers that they believe we're going to come back higher even with our lowest bidder um the last time we did an RFP the lowest bidder was 13 waste management was 30 more than the lowest paid we ended up going with Waste Management after doing the reviews of the scoring process um again I would just looking at all the information I feel based on the time we've had waste management and my experience with them and here in the feedback from the residents I I don't believe that the numbers are going to come back I know nobody's management is saying that they're going to be higher it wouldn't be coming with the bid than what they're going to renegotiate at and like I said I don't know other cities that have changed their services and they weren't happy with the so lowest there is always the answer I recommend that all right so it sounds like we are down to the wire on making a decision but I don't believe we can vote on this because it wasn't only in general am I correct you can vote on this tonight even though it's not part of the road since yes okay so um would anyone or to approve uh this this contract rate increase well that's going to come back to you this is just do you want to go out to RFP or not the negotiated contract will come back [Music] they wanted us to commit to renegotiation to start the process on these in any decision on whatever we were going to um okay so if anyone would like to do a new RFP all the emotion otherwise we question we're locked into the rate the proposal screen you know we're not allowed through that where he came out and said this will be the rate for the next year so the trajectory is we're looking at a 25 increase now they're going to throw up a contract that's in La probably very similar to what we have now I think what Mr riesler is saying and correctly if I'm wrong is that if this goes out an RFP they have to get in on it also may not necessarily get the same rate back how does this person Council comments is this something that we would need or ask or comments from the citizens but we're not voting on anything we're just asking person's comments okay yeah okay so so I appreciate everyone's the position that Kyle is in here's one I have difficulty with first of all when the Koreans vendor made the comment that we're willing to negotiate a certain percentage increase between very good that they're saying however if we go out and we ask for a requester proposal they're sort of threatening for lack of a better term that when they give their proposal number it's probably not going to be as good as a negotiated member that sounds very odd to me first of all secondly when we're dealing with taxpayers dollars and we don't know we have no clue what the other competitors maybe to their proposal anytime I've ever been involved with a government organization I spoke with problem the city organization has some minimum amount of money that you can understand it has to go to request for data or request for proposal if it exceeds that number which is a good thing now um pointed out to me that actually there's verbs in the current contract that we have with Waste Management that says we have the option renegotiating with them without going out to another RFP again I don't support that only because of the unknown is and what we may be hit with if we do it the other way another company probably will come forward and say hey not only if you're going out to proposal I'm confident I'm that number and then we're sitting in a very uncomfortable position or the way that we spend tax credits dollars so that's what I'm uncomfortable without going that route I can't imagine another company like Waste Management saying we would negotiate with you with a number of Acts but if you go out with a request for a proposal where our number is going to be X Plus that makes no sense to me Facebook other comments well the only other thing is the number that Waste Management throughout the course is public information and deal with contract with all my life anyone that's going to fit this judge will look at that number and say I can beat it um I'm not saying which magnitude isn't going to come back and say very upgrade or whatever you never know I mean like attractions of dirty business I have no problem with Waste Management doing an excellent job and I just think they're a little bit high on the cost I mean they haven't last year if you remember they came back and said we're fueled up to five dollar gallon and this is up and waivers up their labor had their labor costs have bottomed out this past year fuels down uh 450 down from diesel can open six and where we get 25 increase so that's that's the problem well I guess what we need we need to find out if we have a consensus on this at all so what I was just like to hear is from each council member of what they think which is what they prefer to move forward with the uh the proposed contract for a team to do an RFP m I really appreciate Kyle's um for the waiting what you've recommended you believe what part of me that we should do however Frank and Floyd have a very good no business goes without getting a request for a proposal and I love voicemail I love what they've done for the citizens they're great for us but I think doing our due diligence for the citizens thank you sir vice mayor Shirley I think we should tell us able concur uh go out here it's Robert all right baby on this case I am in the minority and I agree with Mr wrinkler also but uh this council is it's pretty much said their feelings and I think um Mr Baker you have it before I think we should just see about competitive hoping it doesn't come back in the latest I mean I don't think it will but we made a motion uh that's why I'm going to have to pay comments from this what do you need citizens like to make a comment yes sir yes Transit John Hansen 22nd Street I was here for that Workshop I was one of the few full person here when you discuss this contract and I listened to the waste management kind my question would be are we at the end of the current contract typically when we do these contracts they're multi-year contracts and within those contracts it stipulates a maximum cost increase am I correcting it stimulates a maximum cost increase of four percent based on the cost to index in the past two years if you look at the layout of the TI increases to ask for more different inflationary prices specifically was for a set turn until September 30th 2023 so the term is up so we're not going to be able to find over Waste Management on the specific dollar amount because the term of the contract that's expired that the contract also provides as the city manager has mentioned known as read the language for you the city May indicate the desire to renew the agreement for an additional term the term is 60 months upon giving the contractor 30 days prior to notice the intent to renew renewals shall be by mutual agreement in such event this agreement may be renewed under the same terms of conditions including the payment adjustments has said before then section 9. section 9 shows the dollar amounts and then all the sub-aragraphs and these are the reasons why we can increase it like the CBI and the gas and those types of things okay I wasn't completely clear on whether we were at the end of the current contract or not so okay um the other thing is as I recall from the budget workshop on this topic because census then was you were going to lean towards leaving that door open but considered seriously rfps so I think we go in the right direction take a chance but I can't see what this gentleman was trying to justify 25 that's waiting on what I think it's really reasonable that's my opinion thank you Mr Hansen for any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right back to the council so promotion to do an RFP or Waste Services um I guess we can just develop in either all in favor any of those opposed all right so we have one of those I went the other way to do the group and in the pharaoh anything else Mr River that is all get on it okay I did have one more question for you which was the boat what how much money are you uh proposing to spend for both um right now I'm a government contract for a patrol boat has a lot of options on it it's for shallow water it is good until it was 20. I believe I believe let's get a lot of some time on the purchase but I I budgeted a hundred thousand I know that's right that's how I um I know we can negotiate if we decide on the exact uh model that we want and then go on power of people and get it over with less options getting used both I think that we need something that's new and in good condition um let me ask you this if you've got your vote would it keep you from jumping in the water again it was only because I wasn't going in I can't say that 100 all right any other questions or comments yes um back to the swimworn Improvement context which is wonderful that we're moving moments of the of the streets my question to you is I know we discussed once before you would actually offered that in the engineering firm at some point would come forward either via a workshop which is probably more applicable or the council meeting what would you kind of visualizing how that was going to work are they going to be more on the front end or after they've completed the difference laid out in our our schedule is once they get to about 90 design um and duplicate it on all different options and coming and addressing the council and

Bellevue Estates Island assessment area directing certification of the assessment rules in Pinellas County Tax Collector and providing for an effective date that was a reading of your resolution 20 20. thank you very much Mr Trask Mr rieckler I'm assuming that you can have it generated is that correct that's correct all right would you like to explain to me for this resolution so uh with the assessment this is a requirement um here we recertify it and we do it in July 15 more years uh that sounds correct I would say 15 and basically what happens is uh brag it goes through the three different loans make sure that everyone who paid off it's removed and checks the interest rates um re-re-certified it'll be submitted to the property appraiser to get going thank you before we move forward what it is I'd like to comment on this proposed resolution let's get some comments all right our Council I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution motion made by Leslie material do I have a second second seconded by Jody Shirley Mr Terry you have before thank you any other comments resolution nope pretty much just standard housekeeping over here in that case this is to approve resolution 2023-04 Miss Gentry would you please call the road council member Baker yes councilmember Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro council member Roberts aye council members Abel hi vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess all right so it passes you uh unanimously thank you very much all right we are all to item number 17. this is for authorization the city managers to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department for fiscal year 2023 through 24. city manager real quick thank you mayor um this is the law enforcement contract typically in the previous years we had law enforcement on its own contract and the code enforcement on another contract this year when the new contract was drafted it was being cleared by the sheriff's office that it's unusual that we have two contracts and has deposits would consider going to one contract and they said the terms same essentially um just combined and leaving our code enforcement services at as needed basis how much it which they have in the past so the new proposed contract for the the amount for the law enforcement Services is the 592 716 that is an increase of 7.94 from last year's and then the code enforcement is not available 55.66 per hour which is a 7.5 increase a little history the Pinellas County sheriff's office has done our law enforcement since 2007 when we expanded from the police department in Code Enforcement Services we've used sheriff's deputy to assist since 2020 from the beginning of the code forces County we used them at a 20 hour program week rate last year we decided during our budget meetings that we would drop it down to 15 hours per week at Seattle win um well in my opinion and I propose that uh this curve under Europe starting October 1 we utilized 12 hours of code enforcement for a week supplementing with in-house staff and this contract has been reviewed by each City internal and it's provided thank you Mr rieckler before we moved to the housewarming to the citizens thank you yes Mr granted John Hansen 22nd Street it's interesting the annual increases year over year you get higher higher decision close to three percent more than my this current fiscal year I believe so I don't know what's going on inflation's down Transit all right said some comments are closed and now we're back to the council before we continue on going to need a motion for authorization uh for uh execution of this contract motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second I avoid Roberts vice mayor surely you had before hand to take a look another question do you comment Mr Banker um page four of this contract would you refresh the countless memories and the citizens Feller Shores shares or deputy foreign I don't have those numbers in front of me I know it's been reviewed at least in the past two years I can find that out but I forgot what it was determined um I was told it was like one hour per shift but a couple residents have raised questions to me and I've noticed in the last couple weeks and I'm not I'm excluding July 4th weekend because that'll make sure it's actually paid for extra right just noticing on the beach in the parking lots very frequent just one day two weeks ago the deputy spent over three hours from Sixth Street to cross street picking cars came off of the 6th Street getting two of Miles off of 12th Street and taking two bicycles off at 6th Street now we spent over seventeen thousand dollars per hour 365 days a week I believe with all our choices they were born here because we no longer get the tax we never no longer get the fines for the parking if there's three parts until they get out they have to write it up once traditions did a inquiry of how much time is being spent it was well over three hours a day is look at the house calls they do every day we do have twice a day there's no way that they do this in two hours and I believe we should be getting the color shirt should be getting at least three hours a day which would save you guys are not 17 over 17 thousand dollars in Wisconsin on our time they have a motion the table on the floor right now but anyone likes a second that motion all right the motion dies so the conversation will continue or anyone else like to make a comment about this contract disabled yeah um I understand that obviously the rate did go out in referring to code enforcement but the dollar amount does not because the lower hours on this you know said any potential increase here um what I'm going to ask I mean I understand the concerns about Bel Air Shores but at this point I believe the best method is actually you approve the contract and now that we have a contract that we go forward to approach Miller Shores with you know producing the potential hours in because this contract is between and the county not us in Bel Air Shores so I'm recommending that we go forward and uh with this contract thank you Mr Sable for the comments early what legal question can we sign this contract and then go back into charge of dollars sure to be flying out here more than they're paying for this contract specifically provides that you're going to share of the Deputy it doesn't say anything other than that so once you've signed this contract this will be a divorce I asked for any contributions made or set off while they're sure that would be an agreement between Mississippi and Miller Shore and we're going to share and my question is it's an open-ended contract when it comes to the time that we're sharing the step it is open-ended to the extent that we use the word share and doesn't have any specifics that's and that's my that's my problem that we're getting our citizens are getting tickets or citizens are telling them they need to remove this and they have to remove that and our Deputy we're paying our Deputy to do that I can't I can't vote on the contract until we get some specifications I'm not sure whether or not this has changed from last year whether this was the same language as last year from what I understand it's the same language as a state of assessment of your percentage of time I believe it is and because other areas have similar contracts with the sheriff's department I think that the goal is is to be able to to tend to demand anywhere that it's needed and other than the sheriff not being their life I have no good plans the service that we've received I think if we could step up correctly such as the street on street parking and I would also be interested in knowing if part of that contract includes they'll be here because this I believe is the second or third time and we've had a meeting a public meeting that did not have any coverage so I do have a problem with that and it needs to be resolved I don't think that it will it definitely won't prevent me from voting for this contract however I want this address going forward and I think no matter what we should always have someone on site to make sure that the community and the council and the staff are all safe any other questions or comments let's take it to a boat all right this is for authorization of city manager to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff for fiscal year 2023-2024. okay council member Baker no council member Livingstone yes council member Otero yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess hi so it passes six to one this read for you are authorized to receive thank you mayor item 18 unfinished business do we have any other previous business all right we will move right on over to city council comments so this is item number 19. this month the randomizer begins with council member Sable great um two big items that are up in front of Florida people right now especially us uh one is Beach renourishment and the second one is high insurance rates and I just wanted to draw your attention to the work the city council specifically uh councilman Baker then is continuing quite to get lower insurance rates or even get questions about the insurance rates answered by our limited representatives in Tallahassee second of all is around Peachtree nourishment the mayor has been very vocal in working with various local groups specifically on this topic and maybe you can address them later on but the next Big C median I understand there's going to be some updates on that issue and I believe we're hosting it here on the 26th yes okay so that's uh we usually Supply free food you know coffee and it's really good to understand what's going on with the rest of the beach communities that's all I have thank you thank you Mr Sable all right now we are on to council member Notaro all right over to council member Banker um today I sat down with the representative Ken Fairfield our state rep about with insurance and the changes they made last December He was unaware of a couple things in the state and I'm talking about him statue now which requires each individual if they want to carry One Insurance it now has to match their flood insurance and she pointed out to me that she's looking into secondary homes compared to primary homes and maybe adjusting the rage there and make it more equal but one of the things I addressed to her was about insurance fraud and what they when the state has done now is they put themselves in the 750 billion dollar liability when it comes to cost because they're escalating all these policies to be maxed now you have to Max at 250 75 000 for contents then your foot has to Max at that and to rebuild some of these homes or well under four hundred thousand dollars the first thing people do is get insurance adjuster to come out and they just bring everyone now um she says well you know that's Insurance we're logging 99 there's over 125 000 roofing insurance fraud claims were found fraudulent claims just in 2020. so they found 125 000 how many people really got away so she's going to readdress this and get back to me with a couple people in the state and the other thing is I've been talking to Ray Scott's office I thought it was getting somewhere with him and the end of last month he sent me a consent form to get into this beeper and then last Monday uh I got another consent form from one of his Liaisons to fill out and I actually blew a gasket I had as cheap as staff on the phone saying no it was a misunderstanding we're going to get it so I wrote The Great Scott and I mailed it right it was Naples address I did get a call today from FEMA we're gonna have to sit down hopefully within a week or two about the percentages deduction noted in 2.0 for perv flood elevation and everyone is supposed to be getting here but if you look at your elevation certificate without if you look at your premiums without your automation certificates it's probably the same with your own patients each foot or H6 inches you're supposed to receive the discount plus the city supposed to get a 20 discount for the things we did to modify 2.0 and nobody from the nfip FEMA can show us where that discount is so that's all I understand thank you Mr Baker all right Mr Roberts here up thank you I'm just going to complement both Mike and Frank at our last uh a topic came up that might have been working on for a while regarding the sand got challenges that we have a year over 9th Street and the cool part about it was so Mike as to why he thought the best idea out of how many people saw this was to move the same banking operation which was an idea and then praying said brought up reasons as well why that probably wasn't the most effective process for our city for our citizens that's when it really happened and this should happen I think each and every time we have discussions about what we think is best for our city because through a discussion by all seven adults that are up here a whole different approach came to be which was really the best solution and fixed the problem the problem was traffic flow [Music] but through that discussion I don't know how many you you people have actually participated in that Infamous you're on a rocket ship and you crashed on the moon 50 items like from one through 15 that's the most important thing you do it individually and then you get together in a group and I've done it many many times with with apartments that I'm working with and each and every time the group solution is superior to every single individual ranking in the 10 to 15 member group has been put together and that's what actually happened about the sandbank operation because Mike then heard different input and he put together a solution that we excuse me move the traffic which there's a little space behind us over here that's going to allow the traffic if everybody agrees to it and come down 9th Street and then exit all in one motion and get back out onto the whole book which was really the problem so it's just kind of cool I just wanted to thank everybody on this Council to work that through and it came out really nice thank you I just wanted to thank Miss on you Mr leaks for volunteering I appreciate it vice mayor Shirley okay all right okay this month I have little to report concerning Beach nourishment at The Big C Beach nourishment dominated the meeting however the county is still holding out in hopes that the Army Corps will have a change of heart I get the feeling that the county is afraid that if they fully fund it once then we'll be expected to fund it every time in the meantime the majority of the millions collected from the FED tax continues to be spent on Advertising to bring more and more people to our beaches perhaps I'm missing something but if there's no beach when they get here then what happens I would encourage everyone here to contact your County Commissioners not just one not just the one that represents us but every single one of them can demand that the county creative plan and fully fund Beach nourishment for Santee Island as mentioned once before Council we have an upcoming budget workshop and tentative military meeting on the 17th and finally I have heard Rumblings at least four members on this Council are either ineligible or have decided not to run again apparently having to submit a full Financial disclosure is already having an impact which I suspect was the whole purpose of enacting it so the question is do we really need seven council members or should we reduce the five next should we increase our terms to four years and align them with a general and midterm elections aside from cost cost savings overall turnout should increase dramatically finally should we increase term limits to three currently we are limited to six years or two terms I have seen firsthand at this limit prevents RC from gaining any traction in the county our needs and our opinions have little weight in Pinellas County due to the lack of time to build these relationships my question to each of you is are you willing to consider restructuring the city council in our election cycle I ask this because it's very very important to me that our city dudes its very best and it looks like the path that we're going right now we're not going to have either the amount or the quality of candidates we've had in the past so I just want to take a informal survey right quick um Miss material would you be interested in having that conversation this was able yes Miss Livingstone Mr Roberts about the changes yes Mr Banker no vice mayor Shirley yes all right so I have a four to two and then I would make five so uh I will be reaching out to pay to see if we can schedule a work session to discuss this whether we make changes or not I believe it would be irresponsible of us not to have this conversation as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as those who've watched remotely do I have a motion to ensure motion made by Frank Baker thanks always first starting line right increase doing a second for you uh Leslie all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone thank you very much"
