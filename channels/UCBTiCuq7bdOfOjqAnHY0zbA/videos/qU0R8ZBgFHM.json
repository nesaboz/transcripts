significant accomplishment by a government and its management this certificate was awarded to bel air beach the finance department however we don't have one instead i would like to present this to you [Applause] thank you [Applause] next up the presentation from the pinellas county sheriff's office uh captain lyman are you prepared to give the law enforcement monthly report wow interesting okay everybody hear me mr mayor everybody it's uh good to be back see some faces i'm familiar with and some newer ones some people just moved around but it is always a pleasure to be here i just want to take the time on the report just kind of remind everybody that since your meeting is at the beginning of the month we're always like a month behind so typically we'll be talking about march but in your all's case we talk about february so i'll go through that relatively quickly and then i did identify one thing from march to bring to your attention and then if you have any questions for me i'll be glad to answer any of those so on your the monthly report you had you had two larcenies in february uh other two one was a trailer that was stolen up by 15th there was a construction area an excavate excavator excuse me they stole the trailer up there the other one someone was doing yard work a company was in here doing yard work at a house and they left their chainsaw and a yard and that walked off so both of them with the trailer i just read that report today they've got a lot of good leads on it so they're still working it both are being worked by detectives because the uh obviously the trailer was a vehicle would be a grand theft and then the chainsaw was a felony amount so they're both being work from detectives so hopefully we'll have solution to that down the road but those are your big capers for the city um i did look into your traffic you had a felony traffic and that was self-initiated that's where the deputy was actually running laser radar um and then didn't stop for radar laser but saw they had to their lights the rear lights were out stopped and why not the person's been revoked for how many times so there was an arrest there the other one unfortunately was a dui driving under the influence that was another one where they were patrolling uh somebody wasn't maintaining the lane several times they cited how they kept clipping into the bike lane so they stopped that person that person was intoxicated so at least they were able to remove them from the roadway before they caused some serious harm i looked through your activities it's it's the same pretty much with the activity monthly i mean a lot of its traffic stops directed patrol but it's geared towards what you're all your citizens bring forward you bring forward to us or to win they'll go with me and we'll direct our patrols appropriately and then you don't have a huge on your last page crash uh there's three crashes so there's no real way to other than two were on thursday there's no discernible pattern there that's kind of the february the old data the one i found recently you probably already know about was the crash out at 18th and golf yet another person unfortunately was impaired they were driving said they'd look down or whatever but the the nuts and bolts of it was the lady was impaired veered off hit one of them hit one of the palm trees in the median there got out walked off a resident had seen the person walk off gave us a direction k9 got here k9 track tracked uh tracked the person down to um bayshore 19 in bayshore um 1907 bay were actually founder hiding in the bushes so they gave us the direction that k-9 got but uh i finally was able to get the report clear so i can send it to the city to see if the insurance will obviously take care of that tree but thankfully um this isn't there's not as much going on in the city as some other cities and stuff i think it's good obviously that you don't have a crime crime spree or anything out here but that's kind of the gist of that more reason i'm really here is if you have anything and everybody being all installed and stuff if i could help with anything or anybody's got questions for me so thank you council that chainsaw caper that was an active the guys were currently active working on a home and they put the chainsaw down you're saying and it was a company that was doing some type of yard work that's what the report said so they were doing yard work and left it in a yard i don't know if they were out back or whatever but it supposedly walked off they had some lead it's still active so we took us to one place we didn't get where we needed to go with that place but there's some other stuff that we're working which what section of town was that that was uh that they asked me because i was in order at one point i thought it was up near where the um where the um trailer was stolen that's what i would think it's like oh i'm sorry i have two different packets here to try and make myself look organized it was stolen it was actually late reported up by 115 6th street okay 1156 street thank you yes sir anyone else citizens back to council thank you very much you're welcome mr mayor good to see everybody up next is code enforcement how are you doing good evening everyone uh steve klapka for the record and i want to congratulate everybody in the new positions and and again i've got a special guest that i'm going to be introducing to you here in just a few seconds um as far as code enforcement um we still continuing to go after some of these contractors that are not licensed and doing work uh they with permits got another one today um and as far as some of the other violations they pretty much slowed down as far as some of the nuisance violations that have been going on i have been working with commissioner glenn our commissioner gunn on the status sheets that we do every month and we've kind of revamped that a little bit so starting this month in april it'll show uh all the events that again take place but it's going to have just it's going to be broken down a little bit more i believe we had close to 60 percent of the stuff that i did was on building permits and and catching those contractors and with that being said i'd like to introduce mr larry thomas you've heard me speak of him in the past this is a gentleman that works for the licensing board in pinellas county this is a man that i call when i have an issue and he's always quick to respond and without any further ado i'd like to introduce mr thomas to you thank you thank you again as he said investigator larry thomas mr mayor i'm here we kind of work hand in hand like you said he reports them to the licensing board and made directly and i do the research the main thing like he's mentioned is permitting there's a lot lack of permitting and we're not just finding unlicensed contractors but permits i think the first call that we were on we had a he found a 20-year construction license contractor that didn't pull a permit and this this structure was a three-story structure with a balcony and they went in there and did some demo work and it was a good catch because we you know we're protecting the public with that so that's kind of our whole mainstay our role is in the community is education and compliance simple as that if we have to cite we'll cite our citations they started 500 as a pop and you know we just we just we we are governor under 49 state statute 489 and uh and the county ordinances so um again i don't know if you've heard i mean obviously you might be getting some calls and we don't mean to disrupt anything here but we just want to make sure that people know that we're out and about and we're out there for the public that's uh we operate the the licensing board operates under the special act and there's one of seven special acts of a county in in the state of florida and what that means is that we we govern all over all municipalities so there are only three investigators in the county i'm one of three i have the mid county i work from the gulf all the way to the to the bay so and then we have one north county one south county so there's a lot of unlicensed contracting and unpermitted work going on and we can't catch them all with deputy klapka you know like i said he's the eyes and ears out here and that's probably one of the reasons that we haven't seen us lately unless we roll upon it and we're out patrolling we just don't catch everybody so anyway thank you for your time any questions i can answer for anybody council over here i'd like to thank you for what you're doing and uh obviously people are beginning to figure it out that maybe this isn't the place to be doing that so yeah this is yes and the whole idea is again protecting the citizens of the city you know to make sure everything is done properly so we don't have any issues so stand for any questions uh council second how about the citizens anyone have a question okay back to council one more time thank you very much thank you very much have a good evening okay next up we have the quarterly board reports um currently we only have a report from parks and rec unless uh one of the other boards has decided that they are presenting nope i don't see any takers so let's hear it from parks and rec [Music] everyone it's great to see you um okay so i haven't done a quarterly board report in a couple months i missed the last one so i apologize about that i had a family emergency so i'm backtracking a little bit but i'll be quick um so the community events that we had in the past six months include halloween christmas i'd like to thank everyone that attended i thought they went well um it seemed like everybody had a great time and we were pretty much on point with our plan um we planned to repeat a version of the halloween and christmas with your approval a couple things that we would do differently or if anybody has any suggestions we'd love to hear them but possibly we'd like to incorporate a charity with the christmas event which we didn't do last year just because we didn't think about it whether it be bring an unwrapped gif or something like that and then halloween um it's great that this room is being booked again with so many weddings and whatnot but there are no saturdays open in october there's weddings every day so we're looking at possibly a halloween event on a sunday afternoon like late but you'll get more information on that next month but again just recapping from last year and they went well and we were happy with how they went and all the participation all the volunteers and all the participants we have sold park and rec over 200 beller beach t-shirts tank tops beach towels koozies hats and license plates and i know people suggest other things like not actually a yeti but like the insulated coolers or maybe like little tote bags so all of that goes through kyle and lynn so like suggestions are always welcome because like if if people want it we'll have it made so um again just call or email that'd be great um another event that we had that wasn't so much it kind of fell into the health and wellness category was the health and wellness fair in january we had over 23 health and wellness care providers from daycare to chiropractic care dentist and we had about 80 residents that attended that so thank you i think everybody got a lot out of it that attended we're hoping to repeat it again next january and hopefully have better weather because i know it was so cold and um icky out that day that i think that kind of kept people at home but overall i think that everyone that attended really got a lot out of it um and then on another note they're also potential sponsors for future events because they're local businesses and we have we made a lot of contacts we still do have the yoga with tara both indoors on monday and wednesday and then outside at the beach at morgan park tuesday thursday saturday at nine as it's getting warm outside the stand-up paddle board will resume and we have had four successful blood drives since the last time i was up here so thank you for everybody that participates in those as far as the park and beach accesses um we survey our 13 parks and beach accesses at least once or twice a year we're in the middle of one right now everybody will report back there's four members on the park and rec board right now so we're hoping to get a few more but um we survey those i know our um maintenance staff takes excellent care of those but we just kind of get like another set of eyes on them we take some pictures and then we have like a recap sheet that kyle has put together to say like this was finished whether it be a leaky sink at morgan park or rust or you know it could just be anything so we just um you know it's just for more people who are putting eyes on those and taking pictures and bringing them back to our meetings and then of course we're having the beach cleanups every month on the first saturday we are involved with keep pinellas beautiful now so they provide some of our supplies which we much appreciate and i'd like to thank everyone that comes out for those um last month we had 46 people and this month we had four but i'd like to thank the die hards because it looked like the heavens were gonna went up and rained down one on saturday so anyway so um we will come to one year of beach cleanups i think in june so again those are going well and um it's just a nice little hour down at 19th street so um if you haven't we invite you to join us and it's always on the sign so you know the date um when it's coming up and okay so 2022 um we you guys voted on some of you last month the event it's april 30th from 4 30 to 7 30. it's fly me to the moon so it's like a frank sinatra a rat pack kind of music and we're going to have an italian food vendor they're going to sell pizza by the slice and soft drinks and then obviously you can bring your own you know picnic baskets or whatever you want to do but it should be nice and hopefully we have good weather and um we have a good turnout for that and let's see what else um [Music] we are looking into because we've had it suggested several times i saw it in past um park and rec boards meetings but it's been brought up about having a bellar beach community foundation so it's separate separate from park and rec board i've been trying to set up a meeting with the person who leads it for the city of bel air and we were having a hard time like touching base and getting that set up but if anybody has any information i know we need an attorney to go over the details of it and then just basically it's a non-for-profit it'll be very similar to the um the garden club that did the benches and like some of the artwork that's out and about it would be like that and i know that they to my knowledge they're not doing that anymore so it's been suggested that it would be nice if we could do something like that again so if anybody would like to join in on that or has any input if you could call me i would appreciate that and [Music] i think that's all i have thank you council any questions citizens you mentioned additional board members how many are you looking for um well i think they're supposed to be five and then two alternates so are you are you going to need an attorney is what you're saying is this project going to go forward we're so in the beginning stages that um i just think to someone to go over the paperwork and to make sure that like you know it's an application that you submit to get the um the nonprofit status mr mayor can uh council approve them using our city attorney for that i don't see why not [Music] he's got to do something for his money but does it need to go to a voter um i i don't really think this direction from council is gone yeah okay great thank you i appreciate that and then um on another note i didn't mention that we did put together a sponsorship program like for possible vendor people to sponsor the events that we're having and that is in your hands too so hopefully you guys will get to vote on that next month this is probably asking a lot but what kind of revenue does 200 items generate oh we're not generating any revenue we weren't trying to make money off the citizens okay so my next question is uh but we've got 200 people carrying baylor beach stuff around we do okay great yeah and you know i had a few bullet points on here the sponsorships would be great um and it's always on the website that if you would like to sponsor an event to please call me but because there's four of us and we can't really talk outside of the meetings because of the sunshine laws we're not really fundraisers like you know it's we try to stay within the budget that the council approves for us if we're gonna do something outside of that we would sell tickets like and it would be worth the money that we're selling the ticket for but for the most part like they're community events to get people together it's basically two dollars and fifty cents a household per year to pay for this i mean it's not like we're draining the city budget and if they're you know they're a lot of work and we love to do them if people want them and want to attend them um and again like i know kyle and i have a list of like people that we're going to email out once the sponsorship you approve it that we're going to send the sponsorship proposal to but as far as us like knocking on doors of other cities because we don't have a lot of businesses in beller beach that we can actually ask for money for we're always going out of this area and so as i mentioned earlier with the health and wellness fair i met more i know they were all health and wellness type businesses but you know they would be possibly interested and i don't have a problem contacting people that i know but i don't really want to just blindly knock on doors and ask people to give us money because it's just not my jam any other questions council no uh citizens yes sir uh please come to the podium state your name give your address todd harper 16th street um i just have a question about the idea of the foundation and the idea would be as we talk about events and activities and park and recreation i would like to solicit the idea that private citizens could donate to the foundation and then use the foundation for sponsorship of city events so the idea is that there's a there's a there's a sponsorship in perpetuity for the city events but we have the ability to offer money through the foundation as a funding mechanism to pay for some of these events and then the other aspect of the of the foundation is the question of do we have the ability to build a foundation bucket list of things that the citizens would like to see done that we could fund through a foundation but not necessarily through the city budgets so example being is maintenance of the easements and things like that so that's my comments thank you very much thank you that's it is that it okay thank you very much have a good night thanks thank you all right uh item six now we're moving on to the city attorney report mr and council uh two things one um i have coordinated and we're still in the process with city clerk uh picking a date for a workshop for the board for sunshine law and ethics presentation um it's probably going to be about an hour and a half uh with each section taking about half hour so we're trying to coordinate that for a workshop for council that hopefully will be coming up maybe next week we're working on it secondly pursuant to council direction i have talked to the city manager about drafting a addendum to his employment agreement for future needs that council will have during the budget process so we have a a simple one that we're working back and forth once we finalize that we'll bring it to council to vote on and that's it council any questions citizens back to council thank you very much mr salesman can i just add just ask one question with regards to that addendum to the contract is that something we can add to our workshop that have a short council meeting to uh review it is it that close that we could add it to the workshop date because i would say it's pretty close uh i can't wait another month uh the city manager and i talked before the meeting and we were just discussing to make sure that the compensation for time and travel as was discussed would be included in there but it it's really other than that yes we can put it on okay thank you very much all right item seven city manager report mr reeves mayor and console uh in your package you've got the current month's report uh the 12th and 13th uh bid uh is opening tomorrow we did get the bid back from the boat and sea wall uh it was about 25 000 over what we were actually it was more like seventy thousand over what we were expecting but it's going to take a budget amendment of about 25 000 came in at 225 500 for the boat ramp of course 7th street the sea wall and the sea wall at 16th street the rfp is out for the city attorney it's due the 12th as you can see uh and then the code section we'll review that next monday to get that moving forward the proposed budget the draft is uh ready to go and we're going to give that to the audit committee slash citizens advisory committee and our meeting scheduled for next tuesday at five o'clock i've put at your place uh the financials and for the new members if you didn't get a copy of the budget calendar it's there for you to peruse and and then uh we're scheduling a garage sale for may 7th so the city we'll go back to that get some advertising for it and update our signs maybe a little bit that's all i've got council anyone citizens no back to the council linda we how do we typically advertise the city's garage sale usually we put it in the tampa bay times and the uh well now it's called the largo bel air b okay and then we'll put it on the website people can sign up and then we put signs at each street in uh that say there's a garage sale on this street okay all right and i'm assuming we're still going to figure out some way to keep everybody on the same side of the street we're going to get new signs that say marking this side with an arrow and that's the side we'll put the sign on all right having two or three signs that will make many people happy in bel air beach i've had a lot of calls for all right anything else council nope thank you mr reeves all right item eight city clerk report um what i have on mine this month is just closing out the election process all the campaign reports and and reporting things that have to be done for that and who i have to work with to do that and that's pretty much finished almost all right and then the next thing is the munico supplement they uh i submitted it and then they've sent the cost estimate so you know once that was approved now they'll start working on it to send me the draft and then public records request only two at at this time impressive great job on the election by the way thank you so much council okay vice mayor gunn just uh the estimate for the muni code what about how much is that off the top of my head i i don't have the exact amount but it was less than two thousand i believe i can get that to you citizens oh back to council all right thank you very much mr gentry thank you all right now we're moving on to the consent agenda there are four items on the consent agenda it's uh item nine approval of march 7 2022 city council meeting minutes number 10 is approval of march 21st 2022 special city council organizational meeting minutes 11 is approval of march 24th 2022 special city council meeting minutes and item 12 city council acceptance of the pinellas county 2022 multi-jurisdictional community rating system annual report for program public information floodplain management plan flood insurance improvement plan and flood response plan do i have a motion to approve frank bankert has a motion uh do i have a second second judy shirley there's no discussion during the consent agenda all in favor aye aye the consent agenda passage all right now we're on to item 13. this is consideration of approving alternate citizens advisory committee member john j hayes as a regular committee member the reason why we're doing this is to fill the vacancy of former committee member jody shirley apparently she quit do i have a motion so move vice mayor glenn gunn do i have a second second leslie notoro all right the discussion starts with glenn gunn this is an important committee and uh john hayes has been a positive influence and attended all the regular meetings to the best of his abilities and has always provided a great influence so i hardly recommend approving him as a regular committee member and then backfill the alternate and i believe uh john hayes is here tonight if you'd like to address the council please feel free to do so john hayes 3210 gulf boulevard bella beach mr mayor and council thank you i served a little over a year ago now on a financial review committee and moving to the citizens advisory committee i thought i was going to be a full member to begin with but miss shirley uh usurped me and it's good that she bailed out to become a council member because i'm happy to be a full member now so thank you council person shirley for doing that i do like to serve and i'm very delighted i think you have an excellent committee exclusive of me even but i think they do very good work to help the council and the mayor in making decisions or recommendations for you to consider so thank you thank you do we have any uh comments from the council no more uh how about the citizens oh back to the council one more time nope all right let's uh vote by row roll call council member banker yes councilmember otero yes councilmember roberts yes council member shirley yes council members able yes vice mayor gunn yes mayor goddess yes seven to nothing wow that's amazing congratulations mr hayes thank you for volunteering [Applause] all right now we're uh on to item number 14. that's to review and approve advertisement for the city manager position originally several revised versions were suggested so i asked lynn and patty to select their top two recommendations i see that vice mayor gunn added a third one that i may not have been in the running at the time so has anyone had time to look it over yes so what we'll do is we will move vice mayor guns into position number three uh currently there's uh the first two and then there's a third one which uh was was on the desk whenever we arrived okay so uh yeah okay do i have a motion so moved do i have a second second jody shirley and lloyd roberts all right jody uh go ahead and start yeah so i reviewed all three um and looking at them on the surface i think that the draft glenn gunn presented is a more thorough approach to an ad and gives a clear understanding of what we're looking for other council members well i'm looking at glenn's and i just had a few minutes ago to take a look at that but i think it's very important that we do add where he said a city council manager form of governance because that could be important to anybody that may be applying and i don't think that's in the other two let's see here says the city manager is appointed by and reports to a seven-member city council okay and that's that's in option one and i believe in option two it says kind of the same thing i think that that all of them will serve the purpose but um i i agree with council member shirley that planned guns is uh far more detailed anyone else yes mayor um one thing i'd say at least the only update to glenn's is uh he said send resume with seller history by 3 pm uh that's really not good you need to have received them by 3 pm otherwise people will be on the hook saying hey i sent it you know what what's what's up with my uh submission so you need to say must be received in-house by a certain time any other comments oh i'll just address why i made some of those changes uh lynn and i have sat down and you'll see kind of like a flow chart in there too and just try to hit the major tasks we need to think about when we go through this city manager hiring process and and lynn and i kind of reviewed a little bit he's seen some inconsistencies and some of the blocks will be moved around and changed but what i saw when i initially went through this thing was that if you look at the the third block in the planning phase which is review and define the job description and then you look at the application phase which is the top of the second column and that's where you post the job description i didn't know which was a chicken in the egg you know my thinking is i my expectation was that as a collective body we would sit down and kind of think about what we're looking for in the city manager if you if you look at the first and second drafts they were the result of the last hiring process which was 2017-2018 and then we had a consultant kind of change the job descriptions in 2019 well it's 2022 a lot of things have gone on since then pandemics we're in double-digit inflation and we've got a lot of new brain trusts on the council here who have they're bringing some interest personal agenda things for their constituents and i think as a body i think we need to sit down and think about what are the new threats and spend more time looking forward rather than over our shoulder when it comes to the job description i think some things are changing and i think it's incumbent upon us to to take a good look at that now that can be mitigated by building this criteria for how we want to go through the packages and select them but that has to be done before we open any packages in all fairness and my concern is if we haven't thought of some things or we started looking through packages and saying man i wish we had a thought of that or that's a good thing i i think that's where i see the value in going through this process a little early and because the process wasn't there i at least tried to touch on some of those things to give also any applicant an idea of what we consider valuable and and some of the new things that we're looking for in city managers because of the times of changing and that sort of thing i uh that that was my goal and i just wanted to hit on some of those new things thanks anyone else on council a question um in this draft by glenn gunn are you would you put all these things in here in caps as they are in your no no those are the those were emphasizing the areas where they were inserted into the original draft that i okay it wouldn't go out like with all these camps okay it's just a draft just curious that was just so that you you could read it and just green very quickly what what some of the inputs were okay thank you so i'm i like what you've done i'm wondering if it's possible that we're disqualifying any possibility of or you see them saying we're we're making it so difficult that they may turn away and say i i don't qualify for this and we have no applicants is that possible perhaps but what i'm thinking is i'm i'm hopefully opening it up to people who might say hey you know this is just a the ordinary run-of-the-mill city manager job application and instead try to say hey you know we need a guy with good communication skills because there are cruise ships with more people on it than we have residents in bel air beach and he's a hands-on person because he's only got five staff so he's got to be willing to you know roll up his sleeves and do some work and take an interest in the community and kind of supplement his staff so i'm just trying to hit on some of the things to open it up for people look at this thing and say oh yeah this sounds like a different place or she all right or she excuse me well and and the other thought process is maybe we don't want 150 applications that are not qualified you know maybe we want to keep it narrow so that we get a good pool of qualified people um and then they and then just a question with regards to the job description i know i asked for that because i was going i don't know how you write an ad without a job description right and i and i know we don't have what is the plan i guess this is more towards lin what is the plan to get a new job description are you working with someone are you doing that yourself what's happening well we we have the job description that was updated in 2019 and i've made some edits to it and you know i can send that out to you okay yeah because i'd ask for that a couple times because it's hard to kind of say yeah this ad hits hits the spot when we don't know what the descript job description says it works it pretty much uh mirrors what the job description says as far as you know site plan stuff floodplain crs things of that nature i i i'd like to just address that one question about the the fear of keeping people away because it seems to be too much my fear is actually the opposite i'm afraid that people will submit applications and they won't emphasize a particular skill that we may decide we're really looking for later on you know that thing where we open up an application say gee i wish we had elicited that as a as a requirement so a person submits an application knowing or he doesn't think it's important somebody else emphasizes it well we gravitate toward the person who did emphasize it whereas the other person might have had some great experience in that that realm so i i guess i'd rather open it up than ask for a rock and get a rock back so mr banker uh mr city manager you've seen all three proposals which one do you feel is best since you've been doing the job for a number of years i don't want to try to reinvent the wheel here well i they all have their good and bad things i i think uh which has more good well you're probably on the spot no uh i kind of felt like one or two was really one of those was more directed but there were some things in uh vice mayor guns that i thought maybe needed to be added to one or two i think you do you right now you just got to have a basic ad to try to get applicants you know well you know that's what you want uh we'll update the job description and i'll send that out to you but it's only a couple things that need to be changed on it since things have changed since it was done in 2019 uh but for the most part the 2019 job description is is pretty good so i would be consultant do that that would be number one pardon that would be number one in our agenda no no no the one and two in mine and patty's eyes were identical it was just the words were moved around that's that's how i felt uh in glenn's let me follow this uh i thought you know something you know at the bottom of his pretty much he's saying the same thing also that was just a cut and paste from one and two actually right but i think you know the the comment about due to the small size of the staff close interaction with the residents that might be something you want to add to one or two but the rest of his for the most part is the same as one and two so you know i think it's kind of a trifecta of three and you cut and paste and make one thank you any other comments nope uh let's take it to the citizens right quick any comments okay back to the council um if we have no other comments let's uh let's do a vote by roll call for one two or three okay ask a question before we go but something i did notice between one and two i guess was uh there were differences in a must-have demonstrated experiences certain things or the other ones said something or just are beneficial must have a four-year degree or you know something along the lines of requires a bachelor's degree there were some subtle differences there and again one was nailing down certain requirements and one one one of the others were just saying beneficial so there are some subtle differences there that you really need to kind of look through rather than just say well they kind of look the same well if i may uh vice mayor wellesley's there really is no such thing as a four-year degree you either have a bachelor's or you don't uh most people are going through five six so take before you're out and i guess that's why i put in there or some equivalent demonstrated experience in certain areas do you really need to nail that down i mean there are there are people there are a lot of smart people walking around and mark twain said it best don't let schooling get in the in the way of your learning you know so we've seen it before a wall full of degrees and stuff doesn't necessarily mean lord uh mr reeves did you say earlier though you were going to take the opportunity to go ahead and and kind of rewrite this thing before we vote on it tonight well i was trying to get some feedback from the concert because we really need to put an advertisement out the plan was to put something together to have something to vote on tonight and that's why you have the three options because uh we are running out of time on this i agree that's why we were all supposed to respond to lynn's email did you get response from everyone yes we got something so then let's vote i i think we are in a the perfect storm i use that phrase thing but i don't think it's uh we're in the crisis mode i think we've got a lot of backup and i again i think we we really need to the term like that comes to mind is make haste slowly i mean do do it one time do it right without having to back up and think about this thing so i don't think we're at the crisis mode and we wasted a week in between we could have had some discussion on this stuff last week and we didn't so the question is is i mean maybe massage should put together something and have a special meeting next week once everybody gets a chop on it [Music] okay we had um we've we've called this up for a vote and it's unfortunately we have to vote on it um everyone's given us the opportunity to speak and we have our options between one two and three um my advice is if we don't like the ad once it's uh published then we just revise it later agree let's move forward patty would you please uh call roll it's it you just everyone's gonna pick one two or three and we'll go from there council members able to council member shirley marie councilmember roberts two councilmember notaro one councilmember banker two vice mayor gunn three mayor goddess three i'm sorry i was so engrossed in this boat can you give me the count please okay we had three for number three great one two three for number two and one for number one okay it sounds like we need to have a recount and it looks like it's between two and three let's do another vote you're eliminating one one is out council members able to councilmember shirley three councilmember roberts two councilmember notaro three councilmember banker two vice mayor gunn three mayor goddess three all right it's four to three number three wins and move forward with the advertising please

congratulations okay we're up to item 19 which is unfinished business council city manager back to council citizens yes sir please come up to the podium give us your name and your address john hanzik 22nd street mr mayor council some more point of information [Music] i've been sitting here tonight again observing how people are speaking with this new equipment i'm having difficulty and i don't know about anybody else hearing because some people aren't speaking into the microphones some of the microphones are anywhere from 16 to 18 inches away from the speaker it's not just y'all that you're speaking to [Music] you're speaking to us the citizens i would again ask when you are speaking speak into the microphone i know we have the tendency to look at the person we're addressing if you need to do that move the microphone so that we the people can hear you you represent us but would like to be able to know what you're discussing and hear clearly that's all i'm asking for thank you thank you mr hansek and i'm going to go ahead and address that now uh this is not a back and forth i'm just responding to uh the city manager the very first night we had this this system was cranking i could hear myself i don't hear myself these these microphones are turned way down compared to what they were on the maiden voyage of our new sound system and uh i'm requesting that we turn the gain up next next meeting okay yes can we just take an informal poll people in the background who else is having difficulty so thank you very much any other unfinished business okay thank you all right uh now we are up to council comments uh this month we are starting with council member banker thank you uh just one comment and i made me know the answer but maybe my our city manager can help me what's the rules of regulation of electric bikes on the sidewalks because i had one resident complain that they almost got hit the bike was coming against traffic on the sidewalk and they were walking their dog and to my knowledge there's no regulation no regular no the the only regulation and we took care of that with our ordinance a few months ago is on the beach yeah i understand that but i'm talking about on the walking pavement no okay anything else that's it all right leslie notaro no comments boyd roberts no comments cody shirley just one thing is i want to say thank you for bringing that to our attention on the microphones because i'm looking at some of them are pointed towards us some of them are pointed away like this i don't know what we're doing because these are new to many of us so thanks for letting us know and you know certainly we need to probably do some testing and see where we're at with that so thank you and uh just thank everyone for participating we appreciate it thank you um mike sable no comments vice mayor gunn the microphones are an improvement we're moving in the right direction so thanks for the input and we'll continue to make those quality adjustments thank you thank you all right um i have one item for you which is the uh the southbound traffic light let me pull this thing a little closer here uh the southbound traffic light it's causing some confusion and there are two straight green lights and two left turn arrows as you're headed southbound everyone is confused they don't know what to do is it two arrows in the left lane is it it i think what needs to happen is one of those lights needs to be pulled and centered on that one lane that's supposed to take you southbound i'm seeing more and more people getting confused about it especially if they don't live here if they live here they've they've already adjusted but uh if you could would you please reach out to the county and see if there's anything that can be done yeah i've talked to them about that already and the configuration is they're saying is that's the requirement i have asked them to put a sign on the the expansion up there to kind of direct the turn you know signage is imposed but i will ask them again on my way to work i think if not on my way to work there's there's an intersection that i i pass through often and if that's the requirement then that particular intersection is not uh up to spec yeah i asked the county that when i first got put up there because i thought why you got two lights in that two green lights either put them together close or get rid of one and when i asked that question they told me that's the traffic transportation requirement but i'll go back to them again got you okay all right um i'd like to thank all who attended tonight it's important to know what's going on in your city and it's also important that you be heard by the way can you hear me now [Laughter] please keep coming back and please feel free to contact any one of us if you have any questions or concerns do i have a motion to adjourn motion frank banker do i have a second second jody shirley all in favor hi have a good night everyone"
