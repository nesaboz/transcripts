female that was joging on the beach there was a transient not neither of them live on the beach um they visit the area but um there was a Transit that be falling her then a battery occurred um thankfully it wasn't a sexually battery um but the guy took off she was on with 911 whole bunch of charges came out what the end of it all was she was okay at the end um and we were able to apprehend the person we had K9 and flight out here and they track and CAU thankfully not from the area but yeah it was uh wasn't a good crime to be in the area so speak well I can't begin to thank you guys for all the service you guys did put yourself in the line of fire every day you guys are excellent you're blessed to have and you're all under C right now we appreciate that thank you so much any other questions or comments one one the motor vehicle effect um did that occur in some of these driveway or on the street do we know I don't I can get the answer for you how get just specifically was the motor vehicle the excuse me yeah I'll get the information get thank you yes sir I have a question uh I was out of town over the weekend and I heard that there was traffic accident where a car overturned uh down around 12 13 near that Island I think that's is that the plank the palm tree yes um yes I believe I believe that one was under the influence one right so typically what we'll do is send the stuff in the morning the City manag Distributor if you all the questions when you ask him he'll have it in this case the depy actually sent it um it was a it was a driving Under the Influence related thing I can I can't tell you the number of times that somebody said Pine or palm tree out here or something on your medians and every single time they've been in T and I've been doing this for seven years in this role so they just always seem to hit the medians and they seem to hit the palm trees um this time I don't think there's much damage I think they scraped it but the last time they hit Indian Rocks they took the whole thing out it's just luckily no pedestrians are injured or anything like that even in this case driver wasn't play so but it was a DUI related crash with an overturn car you know about how fast he was going I didn't I haven't seen any prelims on on the investigation so I couldn't answer but when I get the answer regarding the people that you that answer as well I appreciate it thank you any other questions comments thank you Captain appreciate a pleasure all right now we're up to the monthly code enforcement report good evening sir Deputy Richard Trump I apologize I'm not in uniform tonight little private business going on right just after we leave here so I'm just glad you're here thank you sir very much I appreciate it so uh it's actually slowed down a little bit for the uh last month as far as code enforcements we um have been doing a lot of patrols a lot of area checks and trying to make sure that everybody is uh staying in check here um we actually just 18% of the time has been unpermitted remodels and uh that uh has to do a lot with some of the follow-ups and everything else and but we found a couple of houses that we're getting to solar just as an example um it was a good company that was installing the solar but unfortunately they got a little overzealous and they started getting things installed before all the permits and everything else were in place they eventually did get all those permits and the stop work orders and everything were lifted off of those houses so everything went back and up closed then we had one other house that has stop work order on it again for the same permits it was just for some uh slight remodel so other than that uh things have actually been slowing down a little bit um you'll see in theart Char the other enforcement we added that that's a new category that I asked Kyle to add that was just so more that I can document like my extra patrols uh my beach patrols that I'm doing on the Polaris cuz I'm trying to get out there to watch for ordinance violations and everything um as far as the beaches also so that's a new category but I've been spending a lot of time as far as the area checks and everything so other than that with the weather it's a little bit but things seem to be kind of slowing down people are hopefully getting theide idea that you know just do it right and get your permits like you're supposed to I'm sure the word is out we're we're trying to do that any questions or comments for the all right thank you very much sir you thank you sir and enjoy your party no taking the wife out for lunch oh that's even better all right we are on to item number five presentation from the Sun Co fire district I'm kind of disappointed that that being Trum all his budes left because I just want to congratulate the other one and how good he felt being a fireman for the day when he was actually say I said Deputy richw I just wanted to congratulate him on being a fireman for the day making a rescue and saving somebody no good thing and I know our chief is involved and like you said you guys are lucky and we're all lucky to have the deputies that we do

uh so therefore I am in his place once again but I always enjoy coming down here uh so to be quick and give you the updates um training hours for January we're starting to ramp back up I think I

of fire training uh 160 hours of Medical Training uh for a combined total of approximately 170 hours of training when it comes to my area of expertise fire inspections uh we performed in January 127 annual inspections 232 re inspections and in our Indian Rocks area performed 18 short-term rental inspections uh public education we were down here in uh my counter Park Stacy was down here with a couple Folks at the health and wellness mayor she said it was a a great turnout um we discussed fall prevention the folks that came I was not in attendance I believe I was at a hockey game for my son

that who are on excuse me in charge of the apparatus for the day uh operationally Chief Davidson and chief Carz are continuing to work with the county on obtaining a transport capable rescue to put in service which I believe we're also working with Kyle um looking for a home during these hours that this un will be in service at First it's not going to be 70 we 24hour thing uh will slowly phase it in I believe one unit or another will be located here in the meantime until we get that other station constructed in more than Rocks Beach as far as the calls were concerned we had there's a total of 11 calls for service in our beach there were four motor vehicle crashes one I believe that you alluded to two water rescues again one of which uh the gentleman reward for and three medical calls there

questions anyone have questions just really thank you thank your guy for coming out yeah we certainly appreciate the partnership that we have with you folks and I appreciate you having me out this evening thank you Chief all right now we are up to item six which is the City attorney report Mr Mo thank you Mr Mayor I don't have any significant report apart from the agenda items tonight I'm happy to answer any questions you might have um we we are forging ahead with the legislative session of course that concludes March 8th so we're just about at the halfway point of the legislative session um for those of you who are tracking leag of City circulates uh Publications and we periodically update you memoranda some of the Bills moving through right now one that could preempt local jurisdictions on short-term rentals um they're looking there's been some traction on the bills to increase Homestead exemptions which of course will affect cities and revenue streams and the but U if you have any specific questions I'm happy to answer your question Council right Mr more I'm sure we'll be discussed more short now we're up to item seven the city manager report Mr thank you mayor uh run through the projects quickly the uh GF Boulevard undergrounded project um the latest from duke is the uh utility in Sal Florida our project management um Consultants that are working with us they need to go and request each uh property um that Duke is wanting to put equipment um to see if they would consider signing off on an easement um give the size of the right away on golf Bard um we feel like property owners are not going to want to sign that e we are in the process of um checking with each property on to see if it's something to consider otherwise the plan will go back to the original request which was to put the uh switch boxes in the in the um name of it the uh whatever the other um okay Transformers okay yeah the Transformers on on the right away CU on golf bouevard you you have about 8 ft to the sidewalk and then you have another 8 ft after that it goes to the property line so there's plenty of room um for some reason um Duke is insisting that we request seasment to put it on the Cy um we didn't s on south portion and we couldn't get them all so they up holding it back to the right away so just say keep you in the look of what's going on uh I I suspect that you know it'll irritate some residents to have this request but um it's part of the process right now to go through this um storm water Improvement project uh we have on the agenda for the award um along with the storm waterer pump system design which was discussed in the work session so that two items coming up on the agenda the C- review service we had the introduction by by Lou Cerna um and he went over kind of the process that we're going to be going through we're going to divide up the chapters that he mentioned um into different groups the first group is going to be on February 19th work session and the chapters that are going to be covered are chapter 10 22 30 and 50 so chapter 10 is building and building regul regulations chapter 22 is environment chapter 30 Marine structures activities and facilities and Championship via Street sidewalks and other public ways and the RFP for auditing Services next month's meeting we are going to have salt marsh our contractor for our audit come in and present the draft act for which is the uh the annual copy of of financial report um then the draft will go to the audit committee who will meet and at that time we will go over some leur criteria for the RFP so we can move forward on next year's audit contract and that's all I have any questions yes Kyle so the gold Boulevard underground what what streets does this particular phase address so this is going to be nor cos Boulevard um and they're breaking it's phase two um which we've talked about in the planning process phase one was South it caar phase two is north but the breaking phase two into two parts from um Causeway to 22nd Street and then 22nd Street to the okay so this is the causeway to do Second Street phase uh what's both they're they're they just got to go down the line to each each spot where they designed to put equipment and ask um if if the property owner is willing to Grant an easement okay um for this um naturally there's push back because when people look at their yard they know wow there's a lot of space why do I need to put the equipment on my private project okay thank you timeline timeline yeah timeline for that oh we're they're completely done um and the equipment is on the south end so that we have all the materials in the marina that should be happening in a matter of months for phase one for phase two um optimistically hoping that we can get um rolling with utility Consultants of Florida is part of the job which is installing a conduit 3 to four months um throughout this project they they move through everything they need to do and we kind of wa for for decisions to be made and if you can't get the easements what's what's the uh backup plan backup plan is just put the right way any questions thank you m freeer appreciate it all right we are on to the city clerk report I included my monthly summary in the agenda package and I don't have anything of significance to report it looks like business as usual yes any questions or comments for I wanted to thank you very much for the complet of the agenda excuse me the U the minutes me where you actually do more than just record the votes but a little bit about the discussion I find that very helpful sure anyone else thank you appreciate now we're on to consent agenda items 9 and 10 this is for approval of the January 8th 2024 city council meeting minutes and approval of the January 29th 2024 city council work session minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve as written motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second Elli also all in favor I any oppos consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 11 this is for consideration of appointment to the board of adjustments current alternate member Mark Mariano if Mr Mariano is here would he like to introduce himself to the council well I guess he's not here uh would anyone like to any citizen like to to uh comment on this appointment well drive Mr Mar has been an alternate member and so he just a great fit for him to slide into a voting member thank you all right uh Council I'm going to need a motion to appoint Mariano to the board of adjustments motion MO is made by Frank again do I have a second Roberts Mr Baker do you have the floor uh he's already an alterate as gentleman said just a slide isue all right let's do a roll call vote for name council member bankard yes council member Roberts hi council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis hi so it's unanimous congratulations go out Mr Marano and see thank you for serving our all right now we're up to item number 12 this is for consideration of awarding project bid B 23-01 for Street and grage improvements from Street to Moran Drive placed on the agenda by city manager Reaper Mr Reaper you have the floor thank you mayor um just a recap this project is uh to wrap up the rest of the uh storm water master plan it expands from the uh 9th Street in the South to Morgan drive all the way north um most of this is uh necessary uh maintenance and um repair for our aging storm War system um quickly is uh about 26,000 square yards of milon resurfacing for the streets 21,000 ft of curb replacement and 1700 uh cure placey pip Ling the uh there was two bids um that came in on demand star we advertised and they were Kinga and R VZ Incorporated and harbor contrac LLC and harbor contracted came in lowest um significantly by close to $500,000 and uh we uh checked on the projects checked on their work experience um checked on how they feel about getting the project complete in our timeline and everything came back great um they have had good job so that neighboring City to the South Rocks Beach um and they have um you can speak highly of Harware so um it is my recommendation that we award the uh B 23-01 um storm water Improvement project to the uh most faor Harbor Contracting LC before we go to council comments and debate would any citizen like to comment on awarding this project to Harbor contract yes sir please John H 22nd Street I understand the city manager to say this is primarily maintenance and repair so if somebody can refresh my memory it's my understanding that the remaining storm water system was supposed to be camera to determine whether or not new pipe needed to be done so I'm based on what you just said assuming no pipe is going to be replaced is that that that's correct only only cure and place lining for repair okay the other thing I I'm in favor of this I mean the citizens advisory committee worked on this very very hard well Lynn was still the US city manager and we came up to try to call cost reduced this to where once we started we would finish it all the way at one time instead of in phases moving equipment off site and then bringing it back because of the expense I'm assuming that's what this contractor is going to do to save the city money so I stand here in favor of this being approved we're into February hurricane season going to start in a few months it'd be nice to get get the majority of this done before hurricane season we've already had two storms in recent months that have created havoc and it only going to get worse if we something hits us again so yall need to vote on this and keep going on it thank you thank you Mr would any other citizens like to comment on this topic right citizen comments you closed Council going to need a motion to the war project bid 823 01 to Har Contracting LLC were you making a motion yes Roberts and second Mr Roberts you have the Flor thank you mayor we discussed this um obviously the last meeting at which point it did not pass so there's been a lot of information available for this project for benefits why the city needs it uh I think the the U City manager did did a great job of explaining the details and the cost it's time to move on this and get it done other comments from the council yes um while I voted no last month I'm going to support this this month because during a work session where some people think get actually me agreement I like Tok my colleague here uh coming up with an idea and a study to affect her neighborhood fck the whole city so I just want to say I think that's the way government you you work things out come to an agreement and benefits every I'm very happy to support this session thank you and I'm very happy to support both measures I'm glad we were able to work improve this uh so uh if there are no other comments I'm going to ask Renee to do a roll call for council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis I so it passes unanimously contract is awarded to haror Contracting LLC and thank everyone for working through this all right we are up to item number 13 this is for consideration of ordinance 24-1 this is a first reading City attorney Mo would you please read the ordinance happily Mr Mayor this is ordinance 20241 ordinance of the city council of the city of b beach amending chapter 2 Administration Article 2 city council division one generally to create section 2-31 of the city's code of ordinances entitled compensation of councel to establish annual salary for members of the city council and guidelines governing reimbursement providing for the imple implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for cability and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance 20241 by title only on first reading council members this is a direct this ordinance was uh produced in direct response to um least uh potential consensus Direction at the work session last week um I I drafted this based on the discussion you have as we are on first reading I want to underscore if this is not what you have in L pleas know we can revise men as appropriate um the numbers used the the mayor during the work session provided um backup materials on what other communities compensate their council members at the leave the sample that was recommended to be used for this draft with the numbers from Indian Harbor Beach um and so those are the numbers that you see reflected here that's where those numbers came from in terms of the 3 50 uh for the mayor and the 250 for uh individual council members there was a somewhat lengthy discussion about expenses and a general understanding and agreement I think this is in line with your current practices that where you for example to go to the league of City's annual conference the administrations and things like that are typically handled by the city this memorializes that I would suggest that there was a discussion at one point that um perhaps in Li of or as an alternative to to a salary perhaps having uh reimbursed expenses that are directly associated with the office such as preparation um and completion of financial disclosure forms be accounted for that is not explicitly provided for here if that is something that you intend to provide for I would suggest that you make That explicit so that there can be no misunderstanding and there's not a question on trying to fit some you know the S the proverbial square peg in the round hole but since that had been disc discussed as an alter alternative to a salary and this uh and the proposed measure was a salary I did not include that here nor do I is it my opinion that that would fall broadly within this I would prefer that if you intend to make something that distinct that you do so explicitly uh to avoid any any issues but that's the ordinance you have before you as far as the effective date you will see here because of your Charter it the ordinance shall become effective immediately upon enactment by the city council that's the ordinance itself but pursuant to section 2.03 of the city of Beller Beach's Charter the portion of this ordinance establishing a salary for Council Members shall become effective upon the date of commencement of the terms of council members elected at the second regular election following pass of this ordinance beginning first with the regular March 2024 election cycle so that would that says that the first of the two the first one will be March provided be have this adopted on a second and final reading for thank thank you Mr Mora before we go to the councel any citizen like to comment on this proposed ordinance all right Cien comments are closed Council we need a motion to approve ordinance 24-1 so Mo motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by ellot Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor personally I couldn't care less about receiving the salary my comments at the workshop were the following if this minimal salary that we're going to give out if it's approved would assist any of our citizens that were interested in being on our Council and the one thing that may have been holding them back would be the costs associated for them with regards to the form six by having to hire someone to assist them and that varies depending on the complexity of U the financial situation of some of our citizens but if that if this one item will help people feel like they're more comfortable in running for a Council seat then I'm in favor of it and that's why I'm supporting thank you Mr Roberts anyone else like to make a comment I would Echo those remarks that's the only reason why I would support this um I think that um as Mr Banker explained the meeting it is an honor to ser this committee we're not looking for salaries or for salaries for future people but just trying to find a means to help build this board with qualifi people and and and try to eliminate any barriers that they might have thank you any other comments um I'm I'm dead against this but the word with Mr May um I don't think $250 month $ a month make anybody's decision change the the council or not I totally believe this is an honor to sing people B our beach I think this is one great community and what it reasons is because so much volunteers and while I'm going to vote for it I'm also going to Hope because this doesn't go early more effect until 2027 earliest at the earliest cor and and the just for for the benefit of all when I say at the earliest that depends in part on how your election Cycles May flush out following the charter votes at the election C and it can always be be repealed by the next Council every ordinance is subject to Amendment okay thank you all right and uh my reason for uh for bringing this to the council was um you see right now we have four we have four council members uh it's bad enough that the State of Florida is bearing down on us forcing us to do this form six uh I don't I don't see it getting better I only see it getting worse and every time that I meet with other Mayors U and we trade stories they all they all say you know we're not in this for the money but whenever they hear that we're getting nothing for what we're going to do they they don't understand why we're doing it and I'm not going to say that anyone is is better or worse than than b beach everybody has their own set of values but what I will say is that this is a very very small in fact I picked the lowest salary that I could find in all of vanellis County to compare us to and so I matched that salary and instead of thinking about it as a salary it's more of an appreciation pay for what we have to go through every day in the city um so that's why I propos this and that's that's so I'm hoping in the future we're not going to be where we're at right now but we have a full Council and we have people that are willing to step up and uh and join us in this fight to keep our city it is and that's all I have to say any other comments before I call for no all right Renee would you please call the rooll council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis hi and the first reading of ordinance 24-1 passes and we will vote on this again next month thank you once again to all my fellow council members all right now we're up to item number 14 authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated for the investigation and design of a storm water pump system city manager you have thank you okay so this is the uh Pump Station design project that we discussed in the last work session uh engineering has put together a scope of services um the beginning work of this project is to uh look at some of the existing surveys we have also get information on the Underground utilities throughout the area of 9th Street um do some geotechnical investigation and um explore what power is available to um run a pump that we're uh considering and um once this information is collected they're they're going to come up with a design um they already start started uh communicating with the pump company the Mi pumps that came to a presentation here in December and um they're going toh find out give us a good estimate of of cost for the project and um what to expect how effective uh a feasibility study um would be to to install p and and what effect it'll have on the area of 9th Street so um that would be before we move forward with any um actual construction so built in um Le of the timeline provided by jni engineering the the estimated about one to two months together this information and then uh we would have them come in to do a presentation to the city council um to uh to explore if there's any revisions they want made or um just explain overall what they've discovered and um so that the council can make a decision at that point um again the overall cost of the PO is 22,000 um but you know that'll be as we go throughout the project um how did how we build out so just wanted to lay that out um again I include the proposal that work with engineer Larry fluty in design for what we need so that is all thank you Mr Reaper let's go to the citizens for comments Mar being L should drive unless we do something like the Netherlands did to block any water from the ocean coming in what pumps out there when we have a an incident a few times during the year to me is not cost effective and it's a waste of money just my opinion eventually I think we could change the name in the city in another 100 years none of us will be around probably call it Venice Beach because we're going to have flooding of every street and probably have gondolas going up and down the street it's just a matter of time thank you thank you Mr Mr handon John H it 22nd Street you know several meetings back when we had many more residents here and we discussed this issue of flitting the statement was made and the reality is folks we're surrounded by about water that's it's just like the previous resident you want to eluminate the water build a wall and even that isn't a guarantee uh yeah I understand people down at the South End of the city which is lower than where I'm at complain a little bit but we have these check valves I'm assuming they function the way they're in intended to I'm an old US Navy engineer I know about valves big time I fixed them all the time in pumps so I don't get the point and the other thing is um the estimated cost of this um research is $22,000 um when we went over the budget last year I don't know where it's going to come from it's not in the budget so somebody needs to Enlighten us as to where in the budget that money lies and I tend to concur I don't know that the pp is the wise deal if everything else is working properly and in conjunction with that on a storm water system these receivers at the rain gutters if you will I can tell you that two or three of them there at Bay Shore in 22nd Street are two dad guns small to accept the amount of rain sometimes they're too small and we're not doing anything about that either so that's probably something else that should have been considered initially so I'm just bringing it up again I spent 24 years in the Navy on seven different ships I know about these things so appreciate it thank you thank you Mr H any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right citizen comments closed before we continue I'm going to do motion to authorize the execution of this purchase order motion motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Kim Mr Banker do you have the floor well we did bring in one contractor uh back in December at w pumps um and I gave him a bunch of scenar uh and it's true when the order break to seaw wall going to consist the flooding the problem is on the south end of this island um we don't get rid of the water until the tide goes below 2.5 ft therefore back door the Dalia we had water in the street till 5:00 people had it in their house uh National Guard didn't come down our street till I think 3:00 4:00 in high movement vehicle because they couldn't get down the other thing is we just had a bad storm in December as mentioned which nobody evacuated that came in around midnight with 3 and 1/2 to 4 ft of water in the street we don't really have any if someone had to get down these streets during an emergency ambulance or whatever you'd have to get a special unit to get down those streets so this is a matter of safety this is a matter not doing the same thing we did 75 years ago by putting replacing pipes that never really worked um clearly as MW pum Mr the flu he said if he had no water in the street before it breach the seaw wall even after breached the sea wall that would have would been vacated through the pumps and it would have stayed being vacated for a long period of time uh yes he agreed that there might be water in the street it would be in your yard it would be in your dway you go down to First Street up to even 14 15th Street it's a mess and we can do a lot better just by repaying the streets replacing pipes uh what we did my street um 6 Street I believe the check vals are too low okay they don't open up until I think it's down to like 2.3 ft so that water just lays and accumulates for hours and it needs we need to correct thank Mr other comments it's my it's my pleasure to strongly support this measure and I'd like to emphasize that it is a feasibility study and I believe that it is our produ share uny as being uh the trustees of the money in this community to evaluate all reasonable measures that are available to us and uh that's what this study is designed to do and Mr Roberts thank you Mr Mayor um like like the two citizens that spoke I think anytime we have an opportunity to spend money to support our city we need to ask ourselves a few questions one of which would be a project that we're going to do does this support or Aid or help a majority of the citizens in our city so we have to ask that question we also have to ask you know the the amount of money we're going to spend for example if it doesn't support the majority of our citizens but it's a very small amount of money for the actual fix not not this particular study then more than likely that would be something we would probably want to take on that expense if it's a large sum of money and it only really helps or supports a small portion of the city we don't like to say no to anybody that are having problems but we need to make smart decisions with the money we're spending we don't know right now what that cost is going to be for the potential repair so this is a feasibility study as was stated earlier I'm trying to apprach this with an open mind because my gut tells me the solution is not going to be inexpensive in order to try to keep this water out of here and that's what we need to rethink about how we're doing it now there could be multiple ways to to pay for this it may not even be the city's money you know perhaps the residents that live in that area could take on some of that cost or all that cost because kind of like when part of our city put in underground um electrical stuff so they paid for that via an assessment on their tax BS so things like that we need to consider so another citizen need I'm sorry um we close citizen comments and we we don't do back and forth during these debates I apologize but uh that's that's our standard practice um are you finished so we did we did talk about this at L at the workshop and for this feasibility study so that we can at least have an answer as to what a solution potentially can be along with some Associated cost I would say sort of reluctantly I'm going to support this but I am going to support it so if we move forward all right and uh give you a little backstory if you didn't see uh the the last regular council meeting uh where we're in a situation right now to where the only way anything can pass because of our Charter rules you have to have a minimum or yes everything has to be unanimous um this feasibility study was required for us to be able to pass the storm water drain project uh there was no no other way around it it was killed by one sitting up here and um uh this was uh through negotiations this is what we came up with this doesn't say that we're going to spend millions of dollars on pumps what it says is that we're going to do a feasibility study and see if it's even possible will it work and if so then we'll go forward from there and we'll have to vote again uh but this is the way that sometimes in politics you have to get things done and so uh I am awful of this and I actually hope that we're able to do it I hope that it actually works out just one more I contacted the state and I'm also contacting the FED there are a lot of Grants and support these studies okay um pump replacement pump installations it may cost us very minimum to do this NWI talk said don't do it to the whole city at one time do it cou Street we got 9th Street we run right let's do N Street see if it works take take take problems away from the city hall it doesn't work maybe it doesn't cost us that muchy until we do a study out we have any other comments from Council all right we're going to do another another roll call mode on to the record this is to authoriz city manager uh for the execution the purchase order the investigation and design of a storm comp system council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor GIS I Mr reer you are authorized to receive all right we are on to item number 15 which is consideration for Public Works pay increases this was placed on the agenda by city manager Reaper Mr reer you have the floor thank you mayor uh so this is a pay study that uh over the past couple months uh Public Works uh department and Community Services Services administrator has collected um some information from local municipalities um cities throughout and County this um was brought on by the fact that we've been experiencing increases in costs um especially cost of living for um this area of Florida and we wanted to compare the uh the wages to what other municipalities were paying employees so once we uh gather all the information I uh the community services administrator compiled it for me and then I evaluated I included a uh chart of the the nine municipalities that we were able to get job descriptions and comparable um wages from try to arrange them in order um that you could see um in comparison we have two positions we have a service worker 3 which is the functions as the crew leader and we have two service worker 2 positions um when you go through other municipalities depending on the size um and What U you know what work they do whether they have different utilities Parks um facilities it's um you know you have to kind of look at um the different job descriptions try to find something comparable um I laid them out uh one thing I try to um focus on is that you know I'm looking at a position that has um like the responsibility for um service workers which uh in our city actually stands across you know Parks maintenance utility maintenance storm water um and actual facilities um so um in doing so I uh laid them all out I couldn't find some some cities didn't have exactly what I was looking for for a comparable but when I did lay them out and average them I used that average which is down at the Bott the she put together um to determine what recommended minimum be for each position that we have um the last piece of that is um we have two fairly new employees um that have not put in a year of service yet um so I believe that it is um you know recommended I recommend that it stay at a starting salary but we do have another position that has been in the in that specific um Ser service worker 3 position for over a year and I an adjustment um based on that based of what we typically do for our annual um Nar Ras so that's how I arrived at the recommended adjustment and to restate the uh I recommend that we increase the hourly wage for service worker 3 which is the crew leader um from $21 per hour to 2468 and the service worker two position from $18 hour $20 per hour um and I also asked that if we do move forward with these wage increases that we started at the current pain period which um began on January 28th thank you Mr reer let's go to the citizens for comments on this topic yes sir please come right up Mr John Hansen 22nd Street where in the budget are we going to get this extra money over and above Merit pay races that were approved in the budget for fiscal year [Music] 24 so answer that question if this is approved um calculating out the Personnel cost it would for a full year um we're looking at an increase of $18,000 in the public works budget um because we're about 13 into the fiscal year um currently it's about a $122,000 increase um that can be a budget adjustment that we can make at the next regular meeting or um typically we could um see how the rest of the budget plays out with expenditures and find out if we if we need to even move that much any other uh comments M from the citizens all right citizen comments are closed a motion to proceed with Public Works pay increases Mo made by ly Roberts second second by Frank Banger Mr robs you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor the short time that I've been here I know the city has had difficulty in replacing staff that have moved on for whatever reason in coupled with the fact that we have very small crews out there in the field when I first came here we had uh two service workers and obviously if one of those workers are sick or injured or go on vacation there's many tasks out there that can't be done by one person so it's imperative that you have from a safety standpoint and an efficiency standpoint at least two people there we have since then brought on one additional person so we have three which is great but again I reiterate that the times that we have had one or two of those positions vacant it just took a long time for anybody to step up to the plate and apply first of all and a lot of it had to do with the salary so that was the I think it's a great idea that K came up with to raise those to make them competitive with our other Beach communities down the street so that when and if we need to fill a position we'll at least be competitive and be able to fill it so that's why I'm supporting thank you Mr Roberts other comments yes Mr manager if you could confirm please are we fly staff or do we have any open positions we currently have an admin assistant position open which is under the non departmental Bud right this this department is fully staffed correct it's been fully staffed since um the beginning of f schal year and I wanted to thank you for the charts and the comparison it made it made the data very easy to read and understand so thank you good with the thing all right and basic on what I seeing our neighboring communities and uh you know it's kind of hard to compare Apples to Apples because we do have employees that wear so many hats but um the last thing that I would want is someone to have an easier job and make more by traveling 5 miles away or two miles away to go to another so I'm for this and I will be more than happy to vote on budget amendment when that time necessary we have any other comments M Robert you have the last say all right would you please call the RO council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis I Mr Reaper you are authorized to proceed please tell your staff that this Council greatly appreciates all their hard work yes be happy do thank you sir item 16 is consideration a second agenda to Employment contract for the services of Kyle rer as city manager at the city of b beach uh City attorney MO is it your I thank you uh Mr Mayor again this was done um in response to discussion held at our last work session um The General discussion contemplated a potential um function salary renegotiation with manager or additional um salary compensation what you have before you is a template um that reflects what it would look like were you to agree to a salary adjustments in proposed language and and in what that addendum would be the blanks are blanks because there was not a substantive discussion about the figure um as this amounts to a negotiation of sorts um I did not want to put you on any one figure based on you know any idea of mine or any single council member and so um I believe this measure is is more better understood as Mr Banker's than mine as I believe he uh initially proposed it so with that I would yield except to state that you have language here that we would conform to whatever uh this Council agree should reach an agreement thank you Mr Mo that's good with citizens for comments any see is there no citizens you'd like to comment on this uh we're going to close citizen comments and councel I need a motion to proceed with the second agenda motion motion made by Frank Banger May a second anyone like to Second this at this stage you're just seconding the discussion not not a second that uh to approve the final document right correct did I have okay second Mr Rob Mr Baker do you have the Flor well first of all I want to thank Rene for giving us all the work for the research you did and I was alarmed a little bit when I saw any insurers currently offering an inter inter man position at 13649 only pay I believe so Kyle's actually beening this job in my opinion for 3 years come March he's well underpaid and if I was him if I didn't get some kind of a bu I have my resume sent that in Insurance tonight so in order to be good business people and reward our city manager and dedicates 247 to us I think Wonder $138,000 salaries very acceptable Mr Banker could you repeat that please 138 138 uh just for the record we also budgeted $180,000 and we're out looking for a cager so we're still well below that Mark and if you look at deer beach 140 and de Rock Beach 159 uh we are still very very L Council may I ask a point of order here in that I understand that the city manager's salary will be a public record but are the discussions normally held in public and cir before the C yes short answer um all of this is no it is in fact public record your question is well placed let me start from there your question is well placed but um salary discussions uh for even were I to come to you with a proposed amended contract for attorney terms um all of that is and all of that is uh takes place in the public because it's an official act uh which the Sunshine Law requires that any official Act of this body happen in the public the added complicating layer here is uh the position of city manager regardless of whether it's occupied by KY or anybody else is a charter position there are three positions in this city that you folks directly supervise that's myself the clerk and the manager and so those discussions happen in the open and should we ever come to the unfortunate place where you desire to have those positions vacated uh that would also happen in the public um I think your Charter might have some procedure set forth but generally speaking all of that is in the public and and I and I I appreciate that question and I want to make sure we keep an eye on questions like that um um with with all respect to Miss Rose is she's starting in this position she has Decades of experience as a clerk in another state and even as we've started to handle some of the public records requests coming in there's things that in Florida are open record and in other states are not and so navigating that um it's it's totally normal for it to sort of rub up against sensibilities but yes that happens in the public we don't have the ability to tell Kyle he must leave um during that discussion were that he should be excluded from the public thank you thank you for that clarification you I'm a little bit taking it back because we didn't talk about amounts before and I think all of us here are incredibly pleased with Kyle's performance and feel that he's imminently qualified for position and very very impressed frankly with with the way he's navigating through this and the breath of his knowledge so all of that's very good I think the fact that Indian Shores may be an outlier in terms of the size of the community and the amount of the pay there um and I was just going to try to run a number and math is not my thing so I'm slow and pulling up my calculator but it seems to be a fair large increase in a single amount um and there were negotiations for this position initially um it was an agreeable point at that we're off schedule with that it's it's an acceleration of um a pay raise again fully support one it's a question of pay thank you Mr I think there's possibly two additional columns on this chart that that would help me and Randy talked about some scenarios with the city clerk but if I knew how much experience these existing city managers had with the city that they're currently the city manager in addition to how many years experience they've had as a city manager in total because they could have had 15 years at a different city albe it it could be different if they came from South Dakota because of the different rules and regulations there but it would still be they sat in the position and work a position as a city manager somewhere else that type of thing K brings a lot of value because he's been with the city not long in the city management position but at a previous position where he's had an opportunity to learn about our city know our citizens and know the things that are that have been Challen to our city so that's very Val but those those two additional columns would help me and I think Ken as well when we're seeing these numbers that somebody may have you know 185,000 hope that's a much bigger city Madera Beach 140,000 perhaps they've been in that position for 15 years they have no idea and maybe prior to that 10 years in another city but when we're just trying to bring it down to Apples to Apples any additional information like that I think helps us understand where Kyle's number needs to be if my math is correct that's an 18% increase and K did bring up another valid point which is we discussed this number uh way back when and it was agreed upon in contract form and Frank also brought up a great out point was another individual that we were willing to pay a significantly higher number um which means we do have money in the budget uh for Kyle's scenario as well as some of those other positions that we talked about earlier so it's always a tough choice and decision K's doing a great job I don't know what the magic number is well it seems to me that 18% is a one half of a pay increase um at my family's company we did recognize that there was issues uh with with what we were paying people inflation housing fuel manufacturers that we looked at and for the good ones uh I think the largest salary increase we GES an employe was 10% raise in one year uh I I don't think I've ever given anyone an 18% raise in one La um so I calculated at 10% uh the salary increase to uh to become 1265 that's what I calculated on but I'm open to other suggestions it's this is just we're debating on if I can mention one thing belir Bluffs they took the I think it was 2020 they took the city clerk and advanced her into the city administrative or whatever um gave her a and I think she was underpaid she was a city cler um so that's the lowest pay in there 126,000 everything else is well well above that um like I said we budgeted 180,000 I think Kyle worth 180,000 we I should say should say we got to propose that worth it but whatever you want to if you have a number Mr Mayor more AG well that was the number that that I was suggesting was 126.5 I so that's 10% 10% that's 10% and it puts it in line with B gloves um our much smaller neighbor but oh no I'm sorry B gloves not B shorts which is a community that has retail coner um which is something that we don't here have here I think um a 10% raise um is competitive and certainly justif you agree Mr Banker yes all right Mr MOA on the contract the addendum it should State $126,500 and Mr Mayor members of the council um there is a second placeholder establishing when um that amount should take effect whether it is retroactive to a certain date or beginning on on a certain date um you can see that in parentheses immediately proceeding the 2024 at the end of sub paragraph a how do you wish to handle that I would imagine fact immediately so all right I can handle that to confirm can you just restate one more time for the record the salary amount $126,500 understood Council all right so going have to take a roll call not on this one I'm just going to keep it going alll on this uh this is to create a second agendum increasing the city manager's year yearly salary to $16,500 would you please call the council member Banker if I may I'm sorry to interrupt just before we begin I want to be very clear procedurally this won't come back to you you've already seen the documents so we will if this is approved we will memorialize it execute it without further council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member sha Elliot yes mayor gavis I congratulations Mr Reaper Mr Mo please proceed with second thank you thank yes thank you very welcome lunch is on P tomorrow item number 17 authorization of a sole source of purchase of a walk Ro waist stop 24in valve for Street drainage improvements Project B 23-01 Mr re thank you mayor this is a s Source purchase it is a wo uh check valve uh this is when we first started looking to check valves there are a lot of different models this is a newer more Innovative model than some of the ones that were done in the P the duck flap um or sorry the the duck mouth ones or the flap uh mechanisms that often would uh get jammed up and not Clos back all the way so um these aren't perfect but they uh seem to perform a lot better than some the earlier designs and uh we've been using them throughout the city the uh currently I have 14 install that we maintain monthly um but this this particular one we go to the Swale outfall uh at Bayside Park and the streets that it affects is uh Cedar and Spruce which runs through the retention Pond of to the inlet at the both of those streets so um again this is just a a soul Source a soul Source purchase um that uh per our purchasing procedures I need approv from Council and it's part of the project thank you Mr re citizens for comments no comments all right say comments are closed going to need a motion authoriz this purchase Mo by franker second by Mr Banker do you have the I really think this should been included item number 12 but it's a separate item thank you Mr Baker any other comments questions I think on this one we can uh we can just do a voice a Voice vote uh this is authorized city manager to purchase from a sole source for a 24in valve for Street and drainage improvements Project B 23-01 all in favor I you oppos right Mr reer you are authorized to proceed thank you number 18 authorization to purchase an xmart laser Z e 48 in M this is placed on the agenda by city manager you mayor this is uh another uh purchase that is off of a state contract um the uh lawn more is part of our Capital Equipment uh replacement plan um we each year in the budget save uh $5,000 over time we build it up and uh right now we're due to replace our 48 in Toro it's a 2012 Z master um so this is accountable lower um the uh Community Services administrator Aaron glands he reach a lot of the Public Works departments throughout the county and asked uh just personal their personal opinion on what um newer model mowers that have been working well with mineral repairs and the xmart laser Z came back uh with great great reviews so um again this is State Cloud contract that provides uh was public bid provides a 20% discount on the MSRP and um you we're looking to purchase this from cho cho long equipment who we've done business with in the past Mr Reaper citizen comments all right we're back to the council I need a motion to authorize this purchase so motion made by council member Elliot do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts Elliot you have the FL this seems to be normal U equipment purchases um things wear out we had a 20 plus year old let's replace it other com I I just had one question about the uh the soul Source uh or not Soul Source but the uh because it's a state contract is it automatically the lowest price I know it say 20% off MSRP but normally MSRP is doesn't me anything so my question is is should we have at least checked around to make sure that was the best price I believe that every uh authorized dealer of the x mark uses theate State contract and they all agree to MSRP it's a set set price State what it is um it it it gets adjusted yearly you know depending on inflation um do not think that if we went to each other authorized dealer in state that we will get a different price they agreed on to to a market price provided off that Ste contract is% Mr Robert yeah typically if you look at the state contracts I haven't seen this one specifically typically the language is in there that prevents the bid winner from selling it to anyone for a price lower than the price they gave a state so you feel comfortable normally that that's that's a great price all right any other questions or comments no all right this is to authorize the city manager to purchase an xmart laser Z 48 in mower all in favor I any oppos Mr where you are authorized to proceive thank you number 19 unfinished business unfinished business time just as a point of comment just a quick Google search the list at 12,999 so that could be% good any other unfinished business all right now we are on to item 20 which is city council comments this month we begin with council member oh wow I think I think we've accomplished a great deal tonight and uh prior week and I thank everybody for their cooperation and I certainly I know he's left for the night but I uh give my sincere congratulations to um officer U sha Roberts um is it Robert robertt sh excuse me um and I'm and I must say that I have encountered him just in my daily walks throughout the community and I think he repr present exactly what good public servants do he makes an effort to connect with people he's kind um he knows the area and he certainly U gave us all on that day make all right uh Mr Banker um I'm sure uh the traffic will start increasing the next couple weeks with the spring training com down here and everything like that will probably have a lot of problem with citizens not being able to get the street I think it's something you just have to there not much we can do happy birthday babe ruth9 Mr Roberts yeah very happy that we were able to move the um Street and drainage project along the way so hopefully we'll get them started as quickly as they possibly can we all are familiar obviously with the very season on June 1 that doesn't mean sometimes we actually have named hurricanes prior to that so it can happen um we hope we don't have any until August but that may or may not be the case so happy that that's moving along and it'll be enjoyable to see the improvements made and I know our citizens will enjoy that thank thank you Mr Roberts that's always I'd like to thank everyone who's here tonight and everyone who watched it home also like to take this moment to thank this Council for hanging in there not let the state run you off they tried it didn't work um I appreciate your your patience appreciate uh your your ability to remain calm
