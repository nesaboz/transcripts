july 14 2021 park and recreation board meeting hi i'll second it everyone in favor all right cool and then we have no citizen comments because there's no one else here um i was expecting one other person her name is laura french she may be rolling in here she um she doesn't want to like you know officially join but she's going to definitely help with our events which we need the help so like i'm hoping we can get at least three or four more of her i think i have two i think i have three people total so deb and anthony and laura so that'll definitely be a help for our events because we'll we'll get to it later on but um so if like just keep your eyes and ears open if you hear of anybody else everyone just wants to volunteer for a couple hours they don't want to actually like do anything come to meetings or anything okay so item number four on the agenda i'm just going to kind of go through this real quick but stop me if you have any questions so if you listen to the last meeting by any chance all of our events were approved so that was good um so what we have to look at today kyle's been great so like as soon as everything was approved i had i came in here we had a meeting we did the final on the proof for the mailer we got some information back saying okay if you want it in everyone's post box by this day it has to be done by this day so he got everything in he got all the banners done according to what we talked about yeah it's not the actual thing but it's sort of what we said the final was so like for two seconds we had a sponsor and then there was legal issues so like we have no sponsor so i don't know where that stands we weren't really planning on a sponsor so that's okay um um it was from a car dealer so i guess there was some um and they were going to do the whole thing but i guess there was like it got stuck in legal and i don't know any details so yeah and we just kind of like rolled forward as we originally planned and um and whatnot so and then also like the last the list that we talked about like just for amazon for for all three events i just emailed that to kyle too and he's ordered what 75 percent of it i think i have it all on this planet oh okay great okay yeah i thought there was a few more things but yeah so we're in good shape yeah okay yeah everything you've given me got the number you got the extra set of numbers we needed oh good perfect so like you know it wasn't a long list because these aren't really like you know we don't have 50 vendors we're not trying to like decorate the hole outside we just got some some signs for the tables um we got the the signs for the causeway that we talked about yeah i thought the one thing i did notice is we missed the comma oh okay and it's not the end of the world the guy's going to press up just put a little detail on there and move oh perfect so when you see those kyle and i talked about it because like okay with the whole sponsor thing so at the at the moment we had like somebody that wanted to sponsor the whole event but i still had like people that just wanted to sponsor in a small amount so what we decided to do was um add one more table and it's going to be called our community table and we're going to have it at all the events so it's kind of going to be like a like say if we had a bulletin board here in city hall and i'm an esthetician and i want people to know that if they want an organics you know facial they can call me and there's a number and you just pop your if you want to buy some clothes or if you want to do the the polkadot pink boutique at your next party to call nicole so basically all it's going to be is the number my numbers on the website they can call and say this is my name this is where i live this is my business and they can do as little as just putting their business cards on that table and walk away and just enjoy the music or leave they don't have to stay or they can stand behind the table and like say if they want to hand out pens or um you know that helps them hand out things with their business name on them sticker whatever it may be so they could do whatever they want as long as it's not you know over the top um yeah there's got to be a resident they just have to be a resident so i um i kind of i'm sorry i kind of assumed that you guys would be okay with it just because then that way they're getting what they want they don't have to pay anything because really they just want to push their business and we kind of should have that here anyway it's not like they're knocking on people's doors it's a passive i don't consider it solicitation it's a passive advertisement for residents only um and we don't have to man the table we literally just pop the table up we have a sign in front of it and then it says if you want to participate in this like you know just call my number and we'll put you on the table so it didn't really add any extra work for us it's just kind of a way to include the people that want to advertise without charging them money and without like doing anything above and beyond that so does everybody go with that sounds good okay is it sitting at the top oh yeah i mean yeah okay yeah it's not like just networking within your community for the businesses that you guys have how are we going to tell people about this it's on the invite that you just looked at and then it's on um it's on the website so i stayed with patty this week and we redid the whole like park and wreck event board oh oh you're doing it at all events yeah okay so it's a generic banner and we'll just put the table out for like yeah it's just gonna be a passive form sure putting your stuff out there see you guys and people could just pop up and grab a business card and walk away like you said nothing that we have to man it's just a something nice to have for residents if they want to do that absolutely he was about to find some rocks in the garden exactly in case it's windy that's okay we'll just pick them up by the way we'll get the sea shells from the shore you know i wonder too if like you put a little business card holder if they would stay or if they would still blow depends on the damage it depends on the day so if we have to get rocks we have to figure it out yeah it's like bring your own rock i'm just telling people that in case it's windy but like someone asked oh well can i hand out candy bags at the um halloween costume parade with my business card or my sticker on it said yeah why not it's like trunk or treat we're not going to tell anyone that as long as you're a resident and they're like we'll help we'll volunteer blah blah i was like sure i think that's great um so yeah we're set up with both as far as insurance um i think we might have one or two more details but i think as far as um everything all the way up until like maybe the friday before we're good like if we've confirmed with the people what's this the guy from uh gospels do you know what day he was coming back is he saying the email because he hasn't contacted me yet okay with his insurance yeah okay you know he sent me an email yesterday um i i didn't know that it was still i can answer no i just just thought about that i don't think he did he said he was on the road or something like that but he when he got back he was going to contact me i just want to get the contract worked out and okay no i'm glad you said that i didn't realize it wasn't done and you got the email about because like i tried to explain that whole like additionally insured partner i shouldn't have a problem with it i don't know what else to do so i just like it to you it sounded like they were doing something like on a website which would be easy to just give a certificate to somebody but it might be they might actually call an insurance agent and ask them to make that note i mean it's not anything that's out of the ordinary additionally insured additional interest anything with that order and it has to be on the bottom it wouldn't be on the certificate so anywhere that they i i was looking at those accord certificates and i've seen it in different ways people have made it put in the memo area and then um someone wrote it out and then someone just said additional shirt under this line and then but it was it was just on there okay sometimes there's a separate page with a policy number i mean endorse them they'll say additionally sure it's they just need to i guess talk to somebody i don't know it sounded like they were just printing out a certificate so they're like because like that's what i did when like i called the people when i like needed insurance for here and like it was like just in the box because i asked like laura about it and then like just put this info so that's what i did and then when i kicked it to you and you're like oh it has the audition shirt i'm like what i'm like so i'm just trying to figure it out oh you did it for them no when i did my event here it didn't have to say that unless it said it somewhere else but so then i just had them do it the way that i was told and then yeah now i'm trying to deal with them on additionally assured part yeah so i can i can give you examples if you want okay yeah just so like i have something to like oh this is what i need because they're like oh we you know type in what we need and then it automatically generates okay so all right cool okay okay so we have a few more details to work out with the contracts but that's okay we'll get there it's the same thing with all of like the like the different like yoga people are like fitness stuff there are it's always seems to be a little bit of back and forth to get it like just the way it needs to be because everyone would probably ask for different things like you know like if they did it in clear water versus indian rocks versus yeah it seems like a lot in the marina with quote insurance it seems like different companies will do it different ways yeah so i think we're just kind of all of these people that are used to doing these contracts so it'll get worked out it's just getting it down like the verbiage exactly right to make everybody happy um so the other question in regards to jazz that i wanted to get your guys's feedback on is okay so like we don't real we can meet again on september 15th which would be our normal day but we have to get together if we at all possibly can and i'm gonna try to get the volunteers here too the day before the friday before at like two o'clock so we can basically do 90 of the setup like you know put the um just do everything that we can that unless it has to be done at the last minute so we don't have to get here a few hours early on saturday we can just kind of roll up and put it out and it's done and and then if there's anything that like we need to work through we have a day to work through it while people are here in the building so um do you want to skip the september 15th meeting and just meet on the 24th or do you want to meet one more time beforehand i'm neutral either way because i kind of think if i have anything to let you guys know that we need to go back and forth i'll just email to patty and she can send you guys an email but i really like we've gone over this so many times i just don't know what else we really need to do except for like throw it together so it's up to you guys i think if it's all squared away let's just move it just meet on the 24th okay so and then in regards to that like once i have like if you guys find people and then i get my people solidified like so i guess in my mind the way i see like the work schedule that day like in a perfect world like it's a three-hour event obviously we're gonna probably have to be here like an hour before and an hour after but i would love during the three hours to where you work an hour and a half and then you get to enjoy whoever you came with that day like sit on your you know and eat and drink and like so we're not working the entire three hours like say so for example like if nicole does the um you know bellar beach wearable tables for the first hour and a half and then nora would take over the second hour half and then you know i mean so like we would kind of switch because we only have that and the water table and like i know like as far as a greeter i don't really know what a greeter would do like we really don't you know what i mean it's like we're gonna have signs right in the entryway where they can kind of come through and then if they come through by the parking lot then it's like um there'll be tables down there so it's like it's gonna be a pretty simple layout and the signs couldn't be clearer this is where you go for you're going to follow the music yeah yeah everything's going to be right by the music so we don't really need greeters we just need someone handing out water with the koozies and then we don't really need a person to man like the first aid we can just put the first aid by the water yeah i agree with that and i think just all of us kind of keeping an eye on cleaning sure in case you know things blow around or whatnot where people are leaving water bottles well my son is going to be here so i already told him he's in charge of garbage i did i'm like you he will be the person that will do that and i've already instructed he's like i was like you can move garbage cans you can take garbage out you can make sure people aren't leaving litter all over because then that way at the end of the three hours like we're not all trying to go pick up everybody's garbage it'll be kind of like it's kind of like when you have a party at your house and like you know you have someone walking through like doing that the whole time so at the end of it it's like um so that's covered yeah um and so i guess my question is i do you guys want to give me your um because it'll depend on how many people we get and where i put people like i would love to know what your preferences are like i know you want to work the retail table i'll work any of the tables i prefer the water table and early on just because i'm going to have my kids with me and that's always the safest early it's safer than light okay later and water is something they can hang with me rather than retail how many tables are we going to have two just two yeah so george if you don't you can you don't have to do anything if you don't want you can supervise do you want to supervise um what what's your preference get your whistle and uh i don't know if if you want me to rotate in with water or something like that i'd be glad to do that okay so you'll do ours the second shift yeah okay and then you want first shift or second shift on the merchandise table i don't i'll do the whole thing i don't care because i mean after the hour and a half we're not gonna have any merchandise left so speaking of that we're just gonna get rid of it all she's like a master salesman well what i was thinking was like maybe two weeks out from the event um because i know like here they only wanted like one color for women one color for men like she put the sign back up we put it on the website saying there's because even like um i wore a tank top to the last beach cleanup and people that are at the meeting every single time were like where'd you get that i want one i'm like i keep saying they're here like you know they just don't know they're here so um in a perfect world too i would like to take one more inventory and maybe just do a mix of like different colors and styles and like so we have a little bit more to sell but we don't have to we can sell what we have and then but it's like we have like for your event sale huh yeah i mean for our events here but we would sell them there yeah because there's other people in the town that want to set up and if one does it then everyone has to do it who else wants to set up there was a lady like she was at the last well oh you were in here anyway yeah it's all good maybe next year this came up though this isn't my first time no but it wasn't passing to me so i kind of was like like well see and like she would be perfect to put her business card so she could sell it to pull the whole truck out yeah she wanted the truck and i was like if you do for one you gotta do for all and we just don't have room sure if you're gonna start selling if other people are gonna start selling at the event that we have defenders you know yeah we're not okay so which we weren't doing except with ice cream except for the italian ice yeah that's the only one okay um that's just so there's like something and then we don't have to like man it plus put the expense out there to buy it they're doing it all so yes so okay um all right so then i will just you know i'll we'll type this up and then like you know right before it will go over it and then like like i said there will be like you're going to want to break in three hours like we can relieve each other and then like i know that um i've had other people say oh if you want us to pass out water or if you want us to do whatever so we could even do like an hour shift and like someone else can pass that water so you can sit with your kids and eat and you know what i mean like who whoever you bring or if you're with your neighbors or whatever um so you're not just working the whole time that's i don't want anyone to like feel like they have to be behind a table for three hours i don't think it's gonna be slammed for the water in there i don't either but you know where you just walk away and put some stuff up there and come on yeah exactly like it's not like you're selling anything or oh but still a jolly face there yeah yeah no no absolutely and i think it's nice that you could say oh here this is um a bellar beach cookie for you from park and ripper or whatever the city i mean it doesn't matter what you say it's just something that's kind of like you're greeter too because people walk up they're going to see you're getting like koozies water chances are going to go into that table you know so then you exactly so are you good with that yeah okay perfect okay so yeah i mean that's really all we have to talk about like i don't so we'll just skip the meeting on the 15th and then just kind of um throw everything together on the 24th and we're gonna meet on the 24th at three o'clock two o'clock yeah because kyle leaves early and that gives us enough time to like um because i figured we kind of hopefully we'll be here from two to three i mean it shouldn't take that long yeah and if we go later then it's fine is everybody okay with two o'clock that friday at two o'clock on the friday the 24th um yep i haven't been lived that's good yeah yeah okay perfect that's great actually perfect so yeah we'll like touch base on the inventory like i said i'll come in here and take inventory one more time and see and then if they're like no we have 40 t-shirts which we don't well we might we're not ordering anymore so they kyle and lynn will make that call like as we get closer together ordering more license plates work out oh good okay there should be a license so we'll have koozies license plates towels t-shirts tank tops and hats well you don't have to sell it if you want to sell them at the event but they'll look the police have them here okay sell them yeah they sell everything so yeah for sure should they bring anything on friday where everything's gonna be everything's gonna be here yeah and i don't like okay so we're not gonna really have price tags on everything so what we'll do is probably like you know how she has the t-shirt sign up there we're going to make it like more detailed take the picture off and it'll just say t-shirts and tank tops ten dollars beach towels sixteen dollars hats fifteen dollars koozies three dollars license plates whatever you charge from 10 bucks or whatever so it'll just be one size well actually we'll do a sign on each end of the six foot table and then so they won't be asking you how much how much how much how much is it because yeah i haven't had a chance i have to hand off four singles every time yeah you sell a towel it's like you know it could be easier for your working with fives i don't know it's all off the traffic or something okay so they either have to be fifteen or twenty fourteen fifty we paid fourteen ninety five i know so that's up to you i mean we said we were going to try to make money off of this stuff we didn't get that many we're gonna have like 20 [Music] 27 towels if everybody's giving you 20. and we've already sold some of them for 16 dollars oh keep it at 620. oh that's true what's the special deal with that fifteen dollars does 15 really cover it though yeah it covers the cost yeah it really covers the cost it's just beautiful but we did free shipping like amazon was free shipping and then kyle you guys are doing the the work of the selling so cause that's all we were doing with tacon a little bit of a overhead administrative actually yeah nicole works for tips she's gonna have it get all the merchandise out and there'll be nothing wrong it's like nicole where did those earrings come from she's got like little um palm tree earrings yeah anyway okay so that's that works um and then i was trying to think like you know two of the signs will be hung like the one that's in the front of the building like right there but like and we did get grommets on everything but like for the tables like we have the tablecloths that go all the way down and cover the legs it's like so there's really nowhere to tie them so it's like i was trying to figure out actually price shapes or no the banner the one that goes on the front of the table for the hydration station the one that goes on the front of the table for the um our community table like there's nothing like there's a place to put string but there's nowhere to turn into the table can we pin it like with a big seat i mean yeah like a bit large safety pins a little tight that's a big secret or tie it around the lights but you can't tie it around the legs because the legs will become the banner have strings or holes like a shark the grommets are the holes and then you would put the you know like so that's what we did it all water has like holes like a shower curtain kind of does and there's a table cloth going on i mean we could duct tape yeah i think with those big safety pins do we have those can we go find them okay you pin it through the grommets and then maybe one in the middle through the banner itself okay keep thinking like this or we could put duct tape in the middle because we have to use those over and over i really don't want a hole in this pinhole that's big okay well you won't be able to see the duct tape i'm not talking about strapping it over i'm talking about rolling it up and putting it behind it that's going to be sticking it to the tip well it's just like a support because it's already pinned on both sides we can kind of do it like all along the table and no one would see it sure yeah i don't mean like duct tape but like a you're a wrap around all that no um but that's really the only thing like i can't i couldn't think of anything like we were going to need a ladder that friday to hang the decorations like from the in the wrong spot from the things like over because we're only doing it right by the band we'll just have the staff hang it up for you okay well they do a good job decorating supervision oh okay perfect yeah okay so you're gonna sketch just bring on the end yeah because that way you guys want to get on ladders oh okay awesome that's great i thought we were gonna do it all um anything else anybody could think about jazz no i think we're good yeah okay we're cool um so the beach clean up so exciting we went from four people which were basically all park and rug people to six people to 18 people at the last one so yay and then they were all like see you next month and i've had other people call me saying that they're interested and so it's kind of working exactly the way that we wanted it to um so i do need to get like it was kind because nicole could only be there for like 10 minutes oh this was the greatest thing ever so like for the first saturday i literally kyle calls the donut order in like he does every time and i go to dunkin donuts in sankey and they are locked down tight no one showed up for work that day and i knew i had like 18 to 20 people coming and i had no doughnuts and so here's me i'm standing outside at 7 30 in the morning on a saturday i'm so happy i was um like oh my gosh what am i going to do so i called nicole and i knew she had an event she was like i can come for like five minutes to like you know get everybody situated but then i have to go take my you know try an event i was like okay oh my god thank you and i call her like nicole you have to go to publix we have no doughnuts i'm sorry we just got a bad luck at that whole plaza she just stanley yes i know but you know what she priced out t-shirts at like three other different places and they're by far the best deal so and they haven't we finally got the three missing t-shirts that were lost and the back kyle's and the women's ones are i think are better the women's ones are yeah yeah i got them and they're purple i feel better do you feel better cheated on them yeah no we didn't get cheated they um i went in there and they said here you go what do you want so we're all square and like um the thing is is they already have everything designed any place that you would go outside of that they want to charge you for doing the graphics and and the t-shirts aren't really any better and they're like just that um boxy like you know there's no ladies t-shirts and they're no v-neck and there's no online thing we could look into we looked the t-shirts were 16 yeah they're all like much higher than what they are so they have the biggest selection and like they're giving us a deal on not i mean 30 isn't that big of a quantity when you can mix and match everything is that the cell phone in the store they sell them two for 24. so um with the decal so like they gave us like a two dollar discount on everything yeah it's called mary mouse i'm saying key and they do a good it's down at the other end more by backwater grill it's a pretty big place but they have lots of stuff they're actually like they got these beach towels in that's the clearwater beach indian rocks beach i'm like can you get beller beach and they were like no you'd have to order 200 towels and the towels were so terrible they were like paper thin and you know he was charging 12.99 so we got much much better towels and we took it to the same place that do the whole staffs like um shirts and the hats and so it ended up being checked with bolston about um t-shirts too he didn't have any special no he sent me to someone else and i called her three times and she never called me back so she must be really busy or something because he did give me his t-shirt lady and um and i called another person they never got back to me and then when i looked online at a company and she like talked to a couple companies and it just they by far are the best as far as pricing and quality and selection so just gotta get it you just have to get the order you gotta micromanage it check the order before you leave and that's but otherwise it's fine um so beach cleanup was good so um but if like i definitely need um i need some help if anybody because it's it's hard to do it by myself when they're when there's four people it's not hard when there's 20 people it was a little difficult so it's like definitely need volunteers for that too um and you know i i know that like people there would help me it's not like they're gonna stand there and ask to be served so it's not that big of a deal i just need to learn to um what's the word delegate like oh yeah can you help with this and you have then and it would be fine so it's not that big of a deal but we're gonna be to the point where we can literally split people out among the beaches and we had three city council members there which was great and one of them mentioned that the day before they literally had the big um equipment out on the beach like doing like the big cleanup what do you call that um like was it our break or was it the yeah raking i guess that was the rate but that's a like something they drive though right it's not like yeah it's something on a tractor behind a tractor yeah was it us or was it was it still with the county i think it was the county kind of i all i know was he said it got raked yesterday we're not going to find any garbage and he's like i can't believe how much garbage we found so he's like the ring didn't pick up well it's just people blowing every which way from parks and stuff well that and i someone said something about like you know it it falls off boats and then just washes in like you know cups and stuff so we found you know how many um have you ever keep your trash how many bags you're getting how many bags consolidating of garbage um well i can tell you because i give one bag for every two people so like they fell on them yes and some of the stuff like somebody draw like it had to fall off of a boat it was one of those big i've had recliners and things really oh my gosh a whole recliner yeah oh my god i thought it was like a coiled up lots trees wood we got lots of wood with nails in it but there was like a metal coil marker was still good from vadera beach from their markers so they came picked it up really yeah it got all right up here oh my goodness that's crazy so there's all kinds but there's tons of shoes like old shoes one shoe tons of kids toys that like people you can tell it's been there forever like that they just that they just left yeah and then cups and sometimes when you rake you get the towels they're buried in the sand yeah lots of plastic um those actually race for those those disc type things yeah it's a rake and it goes down a couple of trips and finds things and i do cigarette butts too because i can't stand when people leave those on the beach but we have gloves and so it's like it's fine like um so that's good that's going really really good um and then oh sorry i didn't mention this so like per the mayor's request we are going to we did move jazz from five to eight to 4 30 to 7 30 because the sun sets at 7 30 well that won't be a problem for the band because they're right up next to the building like the people that are out more in the parking lot because i guess there's not a ton of light out there it'll just make it easier it'll just make it easier and then you know if it's done that early i mean people could still go to dinner if they want to whatever so the half an hour wasn't that big of a deal um and everybody was good with it so we did that and i don't know i can't remember if we talked about the last meeting because tara the outside um you know she does yoga at morgan park she we've had residents ask for indoor yoga that's more of a gentle yoga because yoga is it's hard on the beach because the sand shifts and you know it's a balanced thing and plus it's hotter than blazes so it's like even if you're not doing anything it's like oh so she's going to start august 30th two classes two yoga classes in the building and i want to say 11 30 on tuesday thursday or something like that but it's posted online and then the um i just got this like a little bit ago the stand-up paddle board her name is jessica she asked if she could outside because she's had a lot of issues between weather waves and red tide the paddle boards aren't happening a lot out there so she asked if she could do a yin yoga class on the helicopter pad you know big or in the grass and like everybody here was fine with it so she's gonna add um just one more yoga class and all of these people are already set up they're just it's an adjustment to their schedule and it's more options for residents if like they don't want to do yoga outside or if they don't want to do yoga on a paddle board but they don't want to be in the sand they can do it here so that's good and then um if you look on the website um thank you for doing this so there's a video of the last you know like the bellar beach private party painting the sunset um you know how your phone turns it into the video to music and then all the still pictures like go live so it's like he turned it into a youtube video and it's posted under the next one which is november 3rd which is a wednesday so and it's a little bit earlier because the sun sets a little bit earlier so there's another class that people i mean i know like she was getting going i missed it when's the next one or you know whatever so hopefully it'll be a little cooler by then i know the sun sets a little bit earlier but um it won't be so hot as it is now so we've got another one of those scheduled is that the same sunset picture though they're paying the same thing um you know i can ask him if he if he will do something different like if you have all the same people then they'll want to do something different if you have a whole new group of people then i mean but you know you're painting the sunset you're painting the sunset it's i don't know what he would do differently i mean right other than like you know you're trying to paint what's in front of you which i can't paint that like if you're trying to paint people and umbrellas i could barely paint the sunset i had to throw mine in the garbage i got sick looking at it like this is not it's so ugly it's traumatizing kids yeah so i i think it's kind of like if you want to go and do it again for the fun of it or to try to learn new painting skills the sunset is a sunset like if you want to you know i don't know how you change that um i'm kind of hoping to get like i didn't know it obviously i didn't know it was just painting the sunset i could not because in all fairness neither one of us were looking at the sunset to get ideas on how to paint we were like blue stripe here black stripe there yellow here you know there was no oh well i was doing that though nobody was checking out the waves to see how they flowed because we were able to you know yeah i mean not at our end yeah yeah paint the dunes yeah so i i don't know like you know i i the thing is it's like for i could ask him like they're cool there's actually asking i was just asking yeah something different it's i think it's just a sunset yeah i think it's the same um and then okay so the other thing i kind of touched base with kyle on this it kind of came through my phone on a post from somebody but there's a lady in largo that does candle making classes and they're all desserts so it's like she has one where you make like six cupcakes or whatever i didn't know if like if you guys have any objections to just throwing that out there and seeing if we could get interest because it wouldn't be in the building it would be in her studio and it's i mean her minimum is four to six people so it wouldn't be like a big class where you know his minimum was 12 or it was cancelled she's not like that if we had three people they could go do it and um she gives a discount on your first class and um it's nothing that i mean it's not a big deal i mean i i can't really see why anyone would be like no way candle making classes are stupid but like i just wanted to know if anybody has any objections to and to the kid no because it's before the holiday and like they are really really cute yeah she's got arts and crafts and they all smell like she does all like cinnamon rolls and cakes and cupcakes and they all smell like whatever you're you're making so wishing you were eating yeah the ones in the pictures were cute i'm sure if i make one it won't be that cute but i thought it would be fun so we'll we'll throw that on there and see if we get any interest and then we um the two dates for the last two blood drives of the year are also on the website so i want to say one's in september and once in november but they're posted i just don't remember the dates off the top of my head and then really that's it for the year we really don't have to other than these three events like everything else is just kind of settled yeah oh and then for christmas kyle locked in the christmas caroler so you would be happy about that and they do take requests so if you guys have requests of songs you want to hear we should get the vision buy our hot chocolate mix yes oh yeah so when you talk about what we're gonna do for the hot chocolate thing we're gonna have it outside because that's fun right yeah so we need to get one of those little portable ones and i think we did it's refurbished huh oh it's a 44 cup home oh it's done it's done 44 cup coffee hot and we have cups that are not styrofoam right we're getting cups um they're going to use lens sam's club membership so i mean we're going to they'll probably be paper with the lids um but yeah anything that's like that could go like i didn't really think about ordering hot chocolate on amazon i think i had the hot chocolate on the sam's club list and the marshmallows and then we won't get like any of the cookies or baked goods or whatever we're doing for refreshments until like the day before or the day of because it's on a monday like we'd go to the store that day so they're fresh yeah um holiday cookies what you get those sandwiches oh that's right in costco yeah yeah sam's club for yeah whichever one so like anything that was like um that we needed i i guess the hot chocolate would be fine but i think i have all that stuff on the sam's club list cups and plates and hot chocolate and like um we'll get cider for the halloween thing like the day of or the day before um and we'll keep it cold like as opposed to having ice we'll just keep it cold and then pour it in the fridge yeah chuck them in the fridge or have them make it yeah there we go just a little bit of ice yeah so that's all good so strange that's hot here and christmas no not halloween oh i know yeah it's like chilly weather what i mean you know oh me too like we would have we you would be in parkos and hats and the poor little kids are in their cute little costumes and they're like bundled up like and then we're talking about how to keep our drinks cold because it's so hot yes like hopefully it's not as hot as it is today but um but i think that's it for the event activity calendar does anybody have anything else that you could think of or that we missed or didn't talk about all good okay perfect so then other business so like we talked about this before but the green space hours that were from 6 a.m to 11 p.m and especially on the south end of beller beach there were issues with people being out there late and being loud um they approved it to move it up to i don't know if it's dusk or nine o'clock but they're gonna shorten it so they're not nine to nine so that's that's better than 11. and then getting the decals to change the signs and then we'll change the website and we'll just do it all at once once i got it out so are you going to do it at all the parks or just the ones that yourself then okay perfect yeah i don't think there's problems at the other ones like we talked about it i think there's just they can park on the street and at indian rocks and walk right across and it's like a free-for-all so um and then i know we talked about like the no street parking on 2nd street because you know by your house right by that park there's always people parked in on the street at the park do you notice it or not so much parking on the street where like going into the park at the end of your block like in front of your house or my house no down in front of the park at second street no i see i can see him from my driveway i didn't know if you could see him from yours i see more golf carts going up there um lots of golf carts going up there into the park like on the ground yeah basically that i see that almost daily no golf carts that's all the time but apart from the car there i've seen it like once or twice and it's pretty brief oh see i see it a lot oh really i see and dev and jeffrey see it a lot because obviously they're outside more than anyone i know and um but i do like i saw it today i mean i see it a couple times a week and i see people fishing there that park there for hours so it's like you maybe you're just not home i see a ton of people parking at the park and then walking over parking parking at brown park and then walking over to fish yeah and that's why we're shortening the hours but on the second street yeah right at the end of your vlog yeah i see the exterminators long care guys does it say on the signs motorized vehicles on the grass because i do see the golf carts too on the grass i just didn't think i always see them i mean they just come up for a minute usually and look around and then there's some people that really park it and out there like camp out that's for sure bring umbrellas i've seen they bring you i've seen people with hammocks on the second or the sorry uh across from from park yeah they do bring a hammock i've seen people really really camp out um but oh yeah people are like out there south side oh no the best was there were these two girls and they had a picnic and they had a pizza and a box of cannoli and don't think for one second that stanley didn't run over there and jump in the cannoli box i was like oh my god i'm so sorry and she was just like i mean she literally stepped in their cannoli box and like i was like no she was on a leash too like i don't let her go because it's like you know those people come around that corner like 90 miles an hour and they're like oh that's okay we didn't need nine no cannolis i was like thank god you didn't have any pizza left because my dog would have been all over that yeah lots of picnics going on in the park not long it's an english bulldog it's so much forward power it's like walking on watermelon when they don't want to walk and when they want to go it's like a motorized vehicle and they're like skiing yeah that pretty much describes it i took my sister's dog for a walk once while she was still sleeping and i it was new to me and i had no idea about english bulldogs and i'm like that is like walking a watermelon i'm like it did not work because oh you can't make a move if you don't like you're so sure you're really low oh they're just i don't know they get in there they're like tanks they really are and they have to walk along the sides and i ever since then i noticed it wasn't just my sister's freaky dog it's every bush bulldog that has these mannerisms we have to walk along the wall right what is that i don't know funny i don't know yeah yeah those cannolis no chance nope um so i've touched on this a couple times recruiting new members or help for events like um again just keep your eyes and ears open talk to people maybe like in your neighborhood or your friends that you see at other things if you can help me if you can help just for like an hour you don't have to join if you don't want to but just like if we need help for like on a saturday for beach cleanup or if we need help with you know um because i think we will need more help for the halloween thing because we have six judges um we have to have like an emcee giving out like the prizes we have to have people manning the parade people handing out the water in the trick-or-treat bags and the dog cookies and so it's like we are definitely going to need that is more of a hands-on like event than jazz's jazz is bigger and it's more expensive but only because of the the mailer got like attached to that one where actually the mail recovers all three yeah saturday morning and the band it's saturday morning yep eight ten to twelve because we couldn't do it on a sunday we talked about it but um dad might be interested huh daddy keith yeah maybe yeah yeah so i'm hoping we can we can find people to help um and you can make the contest you know stay organized yeah absolutely and we're giving really good prizes like 50 75 and 100 gift cards one for each category for dogs and kids so it's like it's you know it'll be well worth people's time to to do it and like i said they spend a lot of money on the costumes and time so you know it's it's good i'm sure brad will be here i think i have the judges covered but i'm not going to say yet because i i'm still waiting on two but i think i have the judges covered i'm hoping i have the mc covered but if not i you know i can do that and i will be like you know do we need a microphone or is it a screaming situation we have a do we have a portable mic i'll just yell you're walking well this is the other thing we can always i know we talked about putting the judge's table like last time below um amplification oh you did how did that go it was all right you were here yeah okay the trunk or tree slash cost that cost anything did you were the judges down on the helicopter they had trophies that they did for those for the awards the judges or i believe mostly constant members can you do that look again we don't have yeah none of the judges or council members like this year i mean i didn't think of that to be honest um i think i made it from you do you make a phone are you guys going to stay out of the event stay out of the event like as far as particularly injured yourself oh no i figured we couldn't stay only security remember then i said that then it's good yeah security stanley's security she's not entering i literally got her black muscle t-shirt that's got security embroidered on the back of it and then she's got like you know we'll have orange vests on she's got a like fluorescent orange harness with a leash so she's ready to lead the pack good i just have to like steer along with some donuts our kids our dogs cannot enter is that correct i'm not enjoying mine they can dress up but like i don't know it just kind of seems like if they win it might be a little yeah you don't know what sure i don't even know who the judges are about sure yeah i mean if they don't know who they are which they want they'll only know be known as a number but i understand what you're saying um because everyone will be anonymous for them well i guess they have to sign up so it won't be that anonymous but the judges don't have to know who they are but the judges aren't council members i don't care either way wherever you are just it's yeah like so stanley will be in the dog parade but she won't be competing i mean like i won't have a costume on her i mean relatively she'll have no costume on but um yeah we can talk about that later stay out of it as far as competing yeah like they can they can be in it they can dress up yeah they can do everything except for like eat in the contest just because yeah it's completely natural neutral yes um and then the only thing that like if do you have an update on the kayak launch proposal or the recommendations that we made a couple months ago are those stocks at seventh street is gonna be first um and that's within the next year but after that okay so we'll just i'm gonna take that off because it's been proposed it's been recommended and it's in your hands yeah i mean but why are we waiting another year in order to pull that up to do what money budget we've talked about all this before i know when we get a new budget in september september yeah but it's it's really what linda's telling me is it's gonna be 7th street first from there we'll just guess what we're going to do next and you said that's a year out 7th street will be constructed this new budget here oh like in a month yeah how long is that going to be off limits for use would you guess oh hopefully we get it done in a couple months after october one okay i know doc people are kind of pushed out everybody's pushed around so i don't know if it's staying that way what does that mean the top people i always know it it just seems like any job that involves any kind of getting anyone to do the job schedule is out even if it's just pulling off lifts and things but we have we're we're not waiting until october to even call them out we're knowing that we're not going to use whatever money but we'll still put ourselves in the rotation though so you can get it well you can't officially give a purchase order oh so we are waiting we're going to shop we shopped it already but we have to kind of reshop it once we're closer so that they're closer it seems so backwards for me a whole summer listen i don't have a bow i'm not using that ramp but i'm guessing it's inconvenienced to a few people you know i mean it just seems like um it gets broken let's fix it let's get it done you know and we know we're going to do it with the next budget's money i'm sure we have the money to forward on or something you know what i mean or at least start it but i don't care about me i mean it's just one of those things i guess we standing up and speaking and it will be done it's in the works it's just so we've done everything that we can do so now it's just in the rotation and we're just gonna have to be patient yeah that's what it sounds like is it really in a rotation i mean i it seems like we just keep putting it off and putting it off and putting it off that's exactly what's happening now and there you're hoping we'll forget about it no no rebuilt it's getting torn out or rebuilt that's just number one on the list so nothing's getting done until night i know but we know that's going to be around xyz dollars that doesn't mean we can't think about anything else you know and and i'm guessing you can get a deal on why you're doing one with the same contractor to do the other rather than doing double the work of signing on with this finishing that job then going out and looking out again and getting a second you know what i mean it just seems like the work is being done a lot of extra work is being done we could just kind of do it at one time has has the plan been approved for the anything else besides seven no no so there's no plan or anything and we have to keep bugging you and why is that because we can't talk about october stuff until october oh we can't talk about new budget stuff until the new budget it's really available it's it lynn's discretion really so if you want to call it up i love them i don't where do i go his number's online yeah yeah all right watch it chat i'll just start doing it at the meeting i just feel like if there's a protocol that we should be going through to get to point b well you did what i could do you recommended it it's just kind of you could take it even further and show up at a council meeting and bring it up there and push for it it's kind of how it works and you talk to lynn directly so lindsay the person if he says yeah we'll go with it it will happen if he says we're waiting for another year we'll wait for another year we have to bring it to landlady i mean if you're trying to do a whole revamp of adding one to every doc that probably would have to go with an actual budget because you'd be talking major money you know project plan how long did it take to get the tennis court project from initial conversation to end how long did that project take well i wasn't planning it was probably money was being was being set aside for i don't know probably three three or four years okay and you know it was in the capital budget and then you know as the money accumulated then you know came up with the plan of the resurface and just get the fences done so it seems kind of like it goes in order of priority of importance there's a certain set of there's a money set aside and then you kind of do what needs to be done in the order of priority money is now being set aside to repair the knocks as they fall apart and that is mainly because of seventh street falling apart um but that's only official money that is set aside in a budget for that sometimes you can get small little things down here and there but if you're talking about adding a launch to every dock that's kind of a project plan so that would need to be added i mean but now we have now we have an actual project to repair the docks but i mean it's really i mean i would talk to mine as well sure yeah and i would just call them on the side i mean i don't if if you go up in front you know if they're gonna want blueprints and pricing and you don't have any of that so he can maybe just well it's kind of like it's not blueprints but um designs or whatever you gotta i guess i guess you need support more so i mean you know if one person just wants something we can't just boom do everything one person another person asks for you know what i mean it's kind of gotta we did i'm just trying to figure out what the development process is so we can get into that mode because it would be a nice thing to have for the all the people that live on the side streets that like and it won't be dangerous like we're trying it's something that people are doing even when they shouldn't do because it's not set up for it and it's just going to take one person to get hurt like trying to launch their kayak from a place where you're really not supposed to launch a kayak and then you know so it's more preemptive to try to like make it safe it just seems like we're promoting kayaking with lessons and what is it paddle boarding with lessons and so we should have those parts have access to the launchers yeah for the paddleboards and the kites i don't disagree yeah so yeah i mean so really is next steps like maybe us calling lynn individually or um what do you suggest should we ask to come to one of these meetings you guys made the recommendation i can have him show up and tell you you know what he thinks that would be great like a timeline or i mean this is the thing if he's just like no it's not in his then we just know it's not in the budget for the next two years because they've already got these six projects underway like you know and then we don't this is not my budget now if it was something that was gonna be it would be put in next but a year because it the idea of it was more so this year around was preparing docs that are failing not adding yeah i understand that but i'm just saying we want to get into the process of docs that aren't failing modifications for launches for kayaks and paddleboards and if we're doing it wrong tell us how we should do it you know that's kind of where we stand i think so i mean i would again i would just go and ask um that's the best way to go to lin invite him to one of our meetings or we could do or you know if um yeah should we just invite him so we all get to hear at the same time as opposed to calling him separately um and we'll schedule it so he knows you know and it won't be in september because we're not having a regular meeting it would be in october and then at that point like this year's budget would be passed um i think our budget is getting tweaked a little but it still hasn't been voted on so we don't have to talk about that right now right it's still good yeah i mean it's when it got i can't remember the things that numbers yeah it came down a little bit was it six to four yeah but then the t-shirts and all of the merchandise won't come out of that is what you said yeah i mean if we're selling merchandise we're making it back up right so that'll be separate budgeting merchandise yes so so it's being tweaked but not really um and then what we talked about and we don't have to talk about it today is like say if these three events are even somewhat successful i told him it's like we're starting real small we told them we would start real small not that i ever want to build up to something with 50 vendors because we don't have the space the parking we don't have any of that kind of infrastructure to do that but like say if we wanted to add maybe one spring event and then just keep the three fall ones the same like we don't have to keep reinventing the wheel if like people liked it we could maybe change it from jazz to blues or you know we could do maybe um i was telling kyle because i didn't realize like crabby bills brought down like the you know they did a beer truck you know and and sliced pizza has a pizza truck so like we could maybe do beer and pizza and jasmine or blues music or something or whatever like for a spring event but we don't have to talk about that now but just kind of like if you can think because um like this and a lot of the stuff that we bought in this year's budget we can use again like we don't have to re-buy like the hot chocolate like dispenser we don't have to re-buy some of the banners we don't have to rebuy you know some of it we will because it's either going to be given away or used up or whatever but like we don't have to start from scratch every time so you know we'll see how it goes and like um i think you mentioned like maybe at one of the tables we put a suggestion box or if like people are like oh i didn't know about any of this stuff let's say then put your email down and get the you know stuff from you know if you don't go on the website then we can get your information so like city hall like when they send out the stuff you know what's going on yeah so like i mean we did the mailing this time so every time no because you're going to get the response this time well this is the other thing like once we get the sign i mean i'm assuming like if we're gonna have jazz in the park we can put it up on the sign and we don't have to send out an expensive mailer because we'll have a way to let a lot of the people who are driving by it all the time see it when is that um estimated to be up and running waiting on the county permit so whenever we get that yeah the signs pretty much build at this point oh wow so overlapping taste of caviar turn around yeah i agree we don't have to do the mailers i love your spring idea oh with the pizza beer and blues or whatever yeah that'll be fun so what kind of pushback are you getting from people that don't like the idea of entertaining the community um there was one council member that was a little vocal about it's not our job to entertain people but on the other hand it's um like the entertainment is a small part of the budget and it's kind of like background music like it's more about socializing and meeting people in the community and just having like um a way to interact like together as a community and try to build some positive juju so i don't really think that like we're not trying to entertain people we're not gonna have like a monthly music we're not gonna have a every saturday there's a movie on the side of the building we're not really entertaining people like the one thing that is a band is kind of like background so if we wanted to be really cheap we could you know play music but like you know people love live music no obviously trying to i i read you know the php or whatever that thing is about there was a feedback saying that people weren't interested in entertaining the whole city which article was that i don't know where you're talking it was in the beach bellarami or the beach is there a difference i didn't see it i saw the one article about the lawsuit yeah that same paper was it a different article it was a different article i didn't read because there were three people voted against it or something like that and one of them said there was they didn't think we should be in the business of entertainment that was one that was frank and he said no to everything but everything that was just his belief yeah absolutely and he said that on his um yeah he walked door to door and that was black and white and bold i don't want to spend you know he's very time he doesn't want to spend anything there's another counselor that brought up the point that we're building community i think with the strategic plan so that it did go in hand okay so i think this is different i didn't want to if there was something we could do to alleviate the fears of people thinking we should be entertained should not be entertained the city you know we should do something to make them feel better there's nothing you can do other than not host the events and put all those pennies back into because people who don't want to spend a single dollar don't respect the singles it's going to be the same people who don't want the sign who don't want because they don't want to spend money it's not because they cared about the sign as much you know or whatever it is they just care about well sometimes a little positive feedback gets rid of those fears of those people well what would you suggest no i i don't know i just try to i didn't wasn't that the meeting so i didn't know what to do it didn't sound like a fear of anything it just sounded like a belief that we shouldn't be doing it we shouldn't be doing it but that's that's it's an opinion i mean you're always gonna have people with different opinions okay and there were only six council members there that night so it had to pass four to two i think because doctor fall yeah i think it was two against the jazz and then there was only a council member they said it was three and three and none of them were three and three because it wouldn't have happened i think you're talking about something else you're talking about other um topics yeah they still have an article yeah yeah because it wouldn't have passed um no for the most part if it was three to three would it pass i don't none of them were three or three three three and three of them would have been the deciding vote if we were three and three there may be the deciding vote i think the three and a three you're thinking about is when they're trying to go for rfp for new legal services again who was against jazz franken who knows mary but he was okay with the other two i don't know he voted what yes to the other two events i know no to the jazz i don't i'm not sure why sure he said why and everyone was there but um robin yes okay and i think she supports events from where i remember from the previous show she's bad at been at them so yeah so yeah i mean i don't like if if they all would have voted you know no you know we just don't do it yeah so it's what it is i mean you're never gonna you know sure and it sounded like with some enthusiasm yeah no absolutely there was i mean you can listen to the audio like there was definitely people that were in support of it nobody in the like citizens and there were a lot of citizens there that night nobody like stood up or said in that you know that we said does anybody have any questions or concerns or whatever nobody raised their hand or came up and said anything negative or you know these are terrible ideas or because it's been positive it seemed positive once it was you know like they got everything that they asked for as far as the planning the layouts the diagrams like they got everything in their packet ahead of time and so um there was a another request for sponsors and i said we are not doing fundraising we're not cold calling people like but so we did add it to the website and to the mailer saying if you are interested in sponsoring an event please contact us so it's like we're not going to say no if you want to sponsor it and then the event is covered and then if the event is covered are they still against entertaining the citizens it's one three-hour event in the year like we're not asking for a movie night every saturday or live music every week or well i just thought if if we made the emphasis on meet your neighbor type of thing rather than entertaining with jazz maybe that would that's been maybe that would your emphasis hasn't it yeah i think it's like the isn't it like um come socialize with your bellar beach neighbors no yeah that's what i'm saying i think that's a good place to emphasize it rather than suggest that it was providing entertainment for them yeah that's what i said it was like and i think i can't remember which council member said i think it was um glenn gunn that said you know it's kind of secondary it's just something to enter like to like in the background there's music while it's like a function of you know just getting to what if somebody did want to sponsor it what are the requirements for that what's the minimum does that have to get approved well there's paperwork and kyle can go into that if it just depends on we have different levels of sponsorship yeah um i can't remember if it was a thousand five hundred and two so they can do their levels um the highest levels a thousand but we had someone proposing to cover the whole budget which is gonna be like two three thousand two fifty or so oh yeah and that's how the community table came up because it still left the little guys that only wanted to spend 50 bucks they could still advertise their business every bit as much like we're not going to put them on the banners but they could still like if they wanted to do their own you know whatever giveaways or you know business cards they could do that without having to pay so like that was like perfect scenario if we had like one big guy as opposed to trying to nickel and dime everybody and then you know what do you get for this amount it starts getting complicated too when you get a bunch of little 250s then you're trying to okay we gotta put them on all this yeah yeah you can't i mean we had a hard time like i couldn't fit one logo on that like i was trying to respace it like if we had to put six logos on that it would have been i don't think i would have been able to do it we would have to do a separate banner saying sponsored by and then you know put everybody's logo and but we don't have that problem right now but you know someone might call and say i tried i asked my husband if stanley could sponsor the halloween costume parade he said stanley have any money he said no i laugh i was joking obviously but so that's kind of where we stand again it's one event for three hours and it's all we have we're not trying to entertain people on a weekly basis every month every week it's like we're not trying to entertain a city it's just a one-off and we'll see what the interest is we'll have a suggestion and we'll find out like if no one is like oh my god i you know but like no one can say i didn't hear about it like you know what i mean it'll be on the website they'll get it in their mailbox we'll have we won't have another sign because for the first one it won't be ready but the oh we don't we're not putting the event on the side well it won't be finished oh no i'm saying the banner oh no the banner is going to go on the front of the building and on the causeway like they do there it's so good that's really pretty like he got all the colors and it's going to really stand out nice in the logo um so i mean hopefully they're like you know i didn't know about it be like you pass it every time because you can only get well you can't get up from any rest but this is the closest so it's like you have to pass it every day i'm recruiting people like crazy like everyone i know i'm like you have to come are you in town you have to come you better put on your calendar you have to come i'm like you think i'd be having a party at my own house i'm like you make sure you know write it down so what count do you think we have how many cars there's 70 parking places so it does say some parking so i'm kind of hoping that people will you know walk or uber because that was brought up in the meeting too what's wrong this side walk southsiders yeah like i know i'm going to have my husband drop me off and you know he can like you know walk or ride his bike we're not going to bring the dog just because she's in pain you know so it's like i don't know great if we felt we respond that would be great if we could respond it's still the same deal it's like if you're a number then you gotta pay for parking yes exactly and if we got you know residents if they really want to come they can park down there at 12th or 6th and walk but if you're getting that that volume that's pretty good this is successful yeah so we don't know we have no idea who's going to come i think once the banner's up there it's like it's really gonna get known like even though the mailers do but like they literally have to pass it every day true that so we'll see how it goes we're gonna hope for the best and just see what comes what comes with it so and then does anybody have anything else on that okay so the last thing and this was just kind of someone suggested this and it's nothing we have to do anything with today i just want to kind of plant the bug in your ear um someone asked me if we do like welcoming and not really a basket or a bag whatever to new residents and i was like you know um whether it be like you know uh a koozie and you know like maybe a gift card and we could get sponsors for it to like you know and then they have their business on the little welcome letter i don't know if that's something we want to do we you know every time someone new moves in you do right meaning the city or no not really oh okay because they move usually we find out when they're they come in for a morgan pass or something so that's the only way you find out yeah which would be the easiest the i know but some people never get better and we know if they're building a new house because they had to get it there permanently it was something somebody asked and i was like you know i'll bring it up i have no idea i think it's a really cute idea to be like no you know but i think being able to track all that is really staring at me yeah if city hall doesn't know when houses are bought and sold and people are renovating or knocking it down that you're just going to knock down their door and tell somebody you know what i mean yeah okay so i think that might be hard but the parking pass coming and getting your parking pass you're getting a new parking pass oh your new resident i'm not opposed to throwing out a beach towel and whatever um stuff like you know 15 bucks of city money to a new resident i think yeah i mean i don't know i feel like that's an easy button easy option i don't know i think everybody feels about that yeah well i was even thinking yeah i mean again not that i want to fundraise but like if someone wanted to be like you know bellar coffee or bellar market we don't have any businesses in beller beach but if someone would say oh well here's a coupon or here's um you know a gift card you know just because you're introducing your business to a new resident in town i mean there's a lot of things we could do with it besides i mean the beach towel is cute the koozies are cute too and they're a lot less expensive um to give two koozies as opposed to like two bella beach koozies like the beach no i know but you're enough i haven't thought yeah yeah i haven't got my parking pass yet see how many people live here for two years um no but i think the beach or but yeah we don't have any businesses so better coffee we'll give like a little five dollar you know come have a coffee on us or a little card i mean coffee on there yeah it's free stuff we're getting we can hand it to them yeah but i mean giving them stuff that we're buying how many how many houses do we have in bel air beach how many how many houses yeah no more than that that's how many people that's how many addresses we got but i mean houses are like in the single 800s house yeah but you can't discriminate against new bella beach condo owner so i would still say it's 12.50 if we're doing welcoming packages to new neighbors we have the challenge okay so do we just let you know that there's a new person and you guys take care of it yeah you know we're the welcoming committee so that's what i mean like placing the book in the ear it could be like a dead soldier like i you know and hopefully that's not offensive but it's just like it um it was just something asked somebody asked me that and i said i will bring it up because it's not my up to my discretion to go oh that's a terrible idea i'm not talking about it ask you no an old resident i think a good this stuff i was just kidding but i think it's really cute and and they don't have to be identical bags or identical whatever you put it in like it could just be whatever is donated or you know yeah so the belair beach uh or the sorry um belair coffee company can be like hey i'll give you 20 cards and just pass them out you know as people come in or whatever and then you know it's a free coffee or whatever it is i can't really think of the baby tackle there's lots of businesses that might do it and it might be fun yeah so it's a thought i mean we don't have to do anything with it today i was just planting the bug in your ear to think about and you know it would probably be something that we would do in january so um i'm on board with it in here though i think rather than us bringing it out there just the city passes it out when you get your parking pass you guys just put it together and give it to them yeah yeah i mean if there's something available it's not like come and get your free it's a surprise if there's something there you know yeah so no one's expecting charges no i don't know what's important marching right here we could give them a copy of the park and recreation boards event and um workout schedule welcome to the neighborhood here's the yoga schedule and here's where you sign up for events it's great it's just a thought someone asked me it may not be under our jurisdiction yeah i can see link all four because i've never been putting and it's just a matter of oh you're a new resident oh we have welcome packages yeah there you go you know yeah but again it's his discussion so when he's here well you don't ask god when we ask about the guy he's like kayak right this is not coming on ramps and we want a welcoming committee a budget for a family well really i mean but that's what people are doing they come to us to kind of right hey what do you think about this and we have to give themselves i don't know who else they would go to other than it's scary to go up there in front of all the microphone in front of all the council members and be like i want to talk you know or like a welcoming thing you know it's easy to come here to us to kind of you know but they're they're the ones that do the voting i know but we we speak for the people they bring that up yeah i mean it's just there's so many things i want that i'm not going out there for no way no way what else do you want oh my goodness no that's a loaded question george christmas lights we have christmas lights okay you go into indian rocks beach and it's christmas and then you come into bellaire beach and there's like one lighted palm tree and the end well cause it costs money i know and they have sponsors they have businesses that sponsor all of that stuff and they have so much more because they have to pay a lot of taxes i'm confused about that everybody says we have no business they're the same they world every year there aren't hotels businesses we have bought one or two you got a motel that's so interesting do you think they want to sponsor 20th street down the end of the street there yeah when he purchased the international motel yes well now yes yeah there's 0.0 chance i'm walking is that investigation i know there's something about it but that's why are you ready all right well okay so do we have a suggestion box that we could use i'm going to film or do we have to make one i think are we wrapping are [Music] [Music] you get on the microphone okay are you doing the suggestion box uh um yeah we want you to wrap up a shoe box in palm tree paper in palm actually with an umbrella thank you thanks and just bring it the day before oh for the event for all you guys will have a suggestion box so it doesn't have to be jazzy just neutral have a suggestion make a nice wooden suggestion box with a slot in it and people can drop suggestions in it and then every council meeting put it by the door do we have one we don't have a suggestion box and then when it's our turn we'll tell what we got for suggestions okay we had 5 000 people here our meeting was going to be on the 13th of what city council meeting because the sixth is labor day and it will either be the sixth or the seventh oh it might be the day after yeah oh sure though which is rosh hashanah i do not celebrate but i um i don't know that's you do celebrate i do not but i don't know if that is from the northeast that is like days off from school um i'll put in the seventh because i imagine possible yeah i don't know because i don't know if it'll be the day after or the following monday because it kind of seems to vary sure on who's available i'm sure they take that into account if anyone's going away yeah but we don't i don't remember the last one if they said maybe they're just going to send it out but i don't have the check i feel like tuesday's the day but we don't have anything that we need to be there for at the next meeting unless you want us so we don't have to be at the next one okay i mean it's not according but you could show up and you could promote the event one last time i get it just saying i don't know what's up you can show up oh to let the same residents that were there last week no i know yeah maybe they'll forget about it some people listen to the meetings you know yeah they do they really do because they record our textbooks yeah you see how many views oh yeah hundreds at least that's not bad yeah people do it for sure okay and so like our next meeting will be september 24th at two o'clock and patty will send out there won't be an agenda it'll be more like a workshop so we can get everything set up for the next day everyone good with that i mean yeah i think she'll probably have like an agenda but it'll be like um that's going to be like our workshop to get everything ready for the next day it's not like a meeting are we sitting in here and having a meeting no we're just doing 2 p.m set up for jazz in the park okay i didn't know if we were sitting here too okay no i don't think we'll need to yes we're just signing up for the event that's what we're doing and speaking to lynn uh should be at us seated recording yeah yeah that'll be at the october meeting okay like october that he needs to know the sense of urgency yes no i just think we should be able to know if we're on some kind of a list or we have to do something to get on the list or whatever yeah this is a standard push yeah like if um if you come to a beach clean up at the events just so people know you're a park and reckon if they have a question they can ask like they know who to ask what if they ask a question we can't answer send them to kyle senator he said what if someone asked us a question that we don't know the answer to i said send them to kyle sorry to go back to jazz in the park but we have enough water coming what do we do oh yeah we're going to get all that at sam's club oh that sounds cool yeah are we getting more cold anyway like yeah oh thank you guys for that we'll have to someone have to bring that day off well we can actually put them together on friday when we're here bring the ice too yeah well like i'll be great i'm gonna bring our two yetis and i'm gonna start like you know asking my neighbor hey can we borrow your coolers and hey can we borrow your and they don't have to be yetis just we need coolers um and i don't know we'll i don't know if we need this is the thing if we buy too much we can use it for the next two events if we don't buy enough we can run to publix yeah you can also use it to clean up and we can use it for the beach club so we will make sure there's enough water and it won't go to waste yeah yeah so like a store right inside here somewhere yeah water yeah you can use garnish everywhere okay yeah so and that's really we don't need a whole lot so expires we don't need cups we don't need napkins we don't need anything for jazz it's just we need water we need ice we need coolers and then they've got the recycle and the garbage everything that matters and then if your son is picking it up let's have him put it to the side of the downstairs in the bags yeah so everything that was on the itinerary that was given to the city council members everything is covered as far as like either purchased or will be purchased as we get closer to each you know each event or whatever and again if we meet on friday and we think of something else we have time to take care of it who's running to sam's club before the next day um they've got to use lens membership soda products but she can get the tax examples from the city oh good yeah everything i mean everything seems to be like i'm excited for the jazz in the park i think it's gonna be really great me too just crossing fingers for weather which is so unpredictable here yeah yeah but again i think it's rain or shine and we move it in like a wedding it'll still be just sad if it gets moved in you know everyone you know the one thing like i would love to have like things of hand sanitizer on at least the two times i just ordered a bunch okay for cleaning up stuff yeah so we can just put some out at the tables at every table now do you have are you can you save because i got big ones um can you save little pumps that you've used you know like a little like just a little container so we can refill them yeah just to save money well the little containers i have are the ones that go in your box okay like i don't have the like oh my god i'll get some that are in pumpkin just so that we can refill them okay that'd be good you know okay so anything like that that you think of just email kyle or email patty since you can't email me and you know then she can kind of disperse it out but i just thought of that like you know it would be nice to have some hand hand-signed sanitizer available um yeah even though we're not serving food or anything like that it's i still think we should have it so we have um plastic bags for the clothing and stuff if people buy something or they're just taking it with them they're just taking it with them okay are people allowed to bring i don't drink but are people allowed to bring alcohol only if they share it with me it's not a it's not a red zone it's not a what it's not the park and the building are not uh all that zone where you can openly carry around alcohol oh so no is the answer there okay i was just thinking um can you read that oh yes yes i can hear that i um i was i was thinking that uh cheese and wine place could set together like pre-order your little picnic baskets you know what i mean and they can handle it all on their own you pick it up all on your own but i didn't want to um promote that if that's not allowed oh yeah yeah no it's um yeah yeah yeah sure understood yeah yeah you can bring your coffee cups your yetis probably all right don't do it okay although okay it's not it's not a wet zone because we don't have a liquor license and no one's selling anything like they drink beer out there last time because crabby bulls took on the liability right so do we actually have a wet zone in this town what does that mean by taking on the liability they put their insurance down yeah their their insurance is covering the the and they're like your license or their understanding yeah okay if something happens yeah yeah that it'll go through their insurance first for sure i understand all right so yeah we really can't promote like wine and cheese plates i was not going to have anything to do with it i was just going to let the launchers anywhere that we're having a little picture of this guy you can't walk around yeah they announced today no it's a cute idea and like i think some people will just know to go there anyway between beller market and bellavino they have so much cute stuff like you know if you want to get the fish spread and they have a market dollar market is down indian rocks road further and they have they've been there forever and they have really good like sandwiches and fish bread and if you're having a big party they'll make it in like the shape of a fish and then they have all these like gourmet crackers and they have a cigar like a um humidor a walk in here under west bay on indian rocks they are north they're north carolina bellar market been there for 46 years and then there's the bellaire like okay right the bellar market that looks kind of like a grocery store or like a convenience store yep that's cute inside but um we have neighbors that swear they have the best steaks in the neighborhood like i never went in there i thought it was like a 7-eleven without gas state you know it's a very fancy 7-eleven the sign outside i just drove by it you know i haven't been here for so long and so i didn't know thank you for telling me no it's good i didn't even know they had sandwiches they're cute and see and that's why they would want to promote for our welcome to the neighborhood bag because people that have lived here forever don't know they're there um if it just didn't happen to come across your you know whatever um so anyway thank you okay are we good just seeing a motion for the making the meeting september 24th it's on my thing okay so maybe on that one we can request that lynn comes in early and i mean i come in then like 1 30 or no and choose probably fine let's make sure he's here that day so that you know exactly that via the whole meeting but if you guys want to you want to have a mini meeting we could have a mini meeting yeah i mean i think patty's gonna put together something we could just go over what we're gonna cover that day so yeah we can have a and just have we're gonna sit down and chitchat anyway what we're doing yeah yeah so 130 or keep it at two um so we have a motion to pass the or to have the meeting and of course on that
