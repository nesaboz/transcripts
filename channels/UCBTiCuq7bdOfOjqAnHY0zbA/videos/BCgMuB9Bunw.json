nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all council member Frank bangard pres Council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot pres mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here City attorney Randy Mora pres thank you reene all right we'll get right to it this is a code review chapter 94 city manager reer take it away thank you mayor pass L CNA um this is the chapter 94 zoning ch CH we uh it's it's a rather large chapter that covers a lot of U the rest of the Cod ordinances so we figured that um addressing the different points of this chapter will help us down the road to to get things arranged as we go through the remainder so Lou yes uh good evening everyone uh chapter 94 zoning is a long chapter there's a lot to it I think we'll do this like we did the last one if that's way you want to go through this we'll just go through the sections and um I've been we've been taking a lot of notes and I'd be glad to answer any of your questions uh first section first article is uh article one in general and this does include the uh the definitions and the sections that are on the screen before you um including landscape requirements uh be glad to answer any of your questions on this or take any of your comments okay are are you asking us to comment on the table of contents well if you've gone through the what's in the section I can I can uh I can walk you through what's some through some of this and uh give you you know our our observations uh if you like I just wasn't sure if you had a chance to go through um but yeah I can I can go through that the I no it's it's fine I I wasn't sure what you were asking us uh what the question was um but let me address the council right quick did everyone have the opportunity to go through all of chapter 94 okay and did you pull out some items that you thought were important that you would like to change all right um is that is that kind of what you're looking for I think so that's sort of what the way it worked out at the the previous workshop and uh I think it worked out well and uh you don't want to hear me read all of this I hope so no no it's not necessary okay so uh yes Mr I was just going to recommend like I talked about the previous time we met that I don't think anybody knows or understands what most of the issues are with our citizens more than our city manager so Kyle it might be appropriate if you could kind of go through and let us know what you get the most phone calls about or challenges about or complaints about that really come to the Forefront sure to take well hold on one second before you do that because your list is probably not going to be the same as ours I actually picked out four items did everybody do that did you have some headless did you two yeah let's uh let's just go around and if we've already covered it he won't have to address it is that okay with fine okay so uh let's let's hear what you got I know we discussed this briefly I think the last time is this what you were I did not um I this is not my editing I had I had Rene out I'm jumping on your more information okay well if if that's the same issue you were going yeah I had some questions about it and I know there was a brief discussion we had last time so it would help me a lot it seemed like there was some specific challenges from some of ouri regarding this particular definition going back 5 years so help me understand a specific scenario we would benefit our our citizen by only going back one year I think is what the discussion was okay and before we even do that um it looks to me like we've been handed out a complete stri through and and I was a little worried about that I didn't know if a complete let's just throw it out the window I'm afraid that it it might come back and buy us in the rear so I would definitely love to hear why you did that okay I sat down with a neighbor that have substantial Dage subanal Dage more December 2023 so I really wasn't aware of all this I me I really but from what I see I talk to Kyle the fiveyear look back the 50% R could be very compromised with somebody their house right this person has $15,000 worth the damage to their house but their estimate only and I might be wrong a couple dollars off basically they were only like $12,000 from being within the 50% R this is nothing but the city this is Fe they cannot repair their houses so now they're going have to tear their house down we build yes and then what I brought to Kyle attention was well with the five year look back could this something happen that I had $50,000 damage last year a storm Seasons coming up and I give another $75 $100,000 damage this year do I have to tear down and I think if we had zero back then doesn't doesn't it reset every year then so you can have zero look back and it would be per event or per per per yes okay but now it's 5 years right accum you know what I'm saying accumulative 5 years so I mean you might as well just St down the house you have three or four storms here's another scenario also people come in and they buy a house that was recently flipped or someone's getting ready to put their house on the market so they do all these renovations to to make it have great Street of well um they come in they buy this home with expectations of they're actually going to do more with it well they can't do anything with it immediately they're stuck they can't do any permitted projects because the person before that dumped a bunch of money into it before they sold it to to uh to bring it up the where it's worth for and uh so the first owner they actually they couldn't exceeded the 50% right so they have to apply for a permit with Ellis County but you still tax on to the new no I get that right so they put a permit into the county and the county does these calculations and say okay you're under 50% to the city city of beach the flood plane speculations okay they assist who assist the county they assist they have their own program that they're responsible for right they do cross check our so is this 100% to do with flooding I mean why is FEA so actively involved I can I can just offer a little bit of perspective here what what's what's going along is there are federal flood plane regulations that state if you the the FED 50% rule as it's referred to is if you conduct improvements or repairs in excess of 50 meeting or exceeding 50% of the structures value then you have to bring your structure up to Modern flood plane regulations for compliance purposes the rationale now behind that is you avoid and I'm forgetting the the uh philosophical Greek analogy of this of the person who replaces piece by piece of their ship and at some point there's no original piece of the ship left but it is the same ship right and so you avoid that and say okay if you're going to rebuild this then we want to rebuild it in a way that is from and regardless of people's perspectives on this that is responsible and consistent with modern design standards you know so elevating it above X ft above Bas flood elevation and other similar requirements the look back period in communities whether it's none at all to five years and I've seen even longer in some jurisdictions is to prevent somebody from saying if you have no look back whatsoever as Kyle suggested it is done permit by permit well if I just break my project into a series of smaller parts this will let's say my home is worth $100,000 understanding that's not really many homes anymore in beach but let's say your home is $100,000 and I I plan to do $75,000 worth of repairs but instead I do a series $75 $1,000 repairs and I work around that 50% mod so from Community standards for their firm rating or Insurance rating and otherwise to remain compliant with FEMA's guidelines they say okay we want to capture this so that on mass our properties are compliant and up to Modern design standards because it can won't necessarily on single property but can affect your insurance rating with the federal flood plane program if your properties are knowingly not compliant with its standards and so this is a I hate to use this term given other recent discussions a check valve of sorts on that uh compliance process so that's what we're talking about and there are guidelines that FEMA provides on determining what is the property value which improvements do you count and that's what saying he he reviews and with the assistance of County and at times State Personnel to say hey I'm you know I'm a little unclear because he doesn't administer this on a day-to-day at the same level and so he relies on the resources But ultimately those determinations at first blush are made at the local level so that's what we're talking about and so when you try to understand why have a look back period at all that's the why at all whether it's none 6 months one year 5 years that's ultimately your decisions as policy makers I'm not aware and and Kyle in his previous research I believe has stated that he's not aware of any absolute requirement that you have a look back period but again it's it's generally to facilitate your transition towards compliance and modernity if you will so what would be a potential risk if we got rid of the 5year look back and had none and so all of a sudden we were spending a lot of money in these homes what's the potential risk to the city if you have none whatsoever you run the risk of people and I don't mean this derisively playing a little more fast and loose and saying well I could never I will no one will ever be reach the 50% threshold because they'll just phase their project in a way to ever avoid being there if you have that 50% rule you capture whether it's hey I just moved into a remodel I'm I'm now stuck with the fact that they've already done $95,000 worth of improvements on this $200,000 house so I'm limited to five and wait a year and then I can do it um but those are the sorts of concerns and again I'm not opining on what you should have just that's how and coming from the building trade working in different states that have Val wage minimal wage laws a lot of cities and states have a minimum of $100,000 oh they have to haveing W to so a lot of these municipalities will do a lot of these projects 75 95,000 rather doing 500,000 five you know million doll job so we're so what I'm saying is yes we are giving the residents the opportunity to spruce up their homes you know in the 50% Mar by peace meal but every time they submit a permit we get a tax your taxes generally go up and we get we get a benefit out of that I commend you again like you're talking about Aesthetics like somebody the house I'm talking about somebody getting W down oh yeah I get that I know that there are some Provisions in our code uh that deal specifically with emergencies uh can you kind of elaborate on that is this relating to 50% r or I'm I'm not sure I I've focused on 94 but I thought that there was another section that that had a slightly different set of rules for uh FL yeah the flood PL management the way that I read it is the 5e look back applies to the Improvement side of things but when you look at the definition which is the thing is Kyle's like the whole monitor here he get he gets Dum the wall people start hating because saying you're screwing the but he's not he's just well it's terrible for the position that Kyle was in have to be the the the no guy yeah because chapter 74 is that's our flood plan management chapter and that's based on a Model that was provided by and if you go to our [Music] con um we're looking can I ask another question um just understanding um the framework this is working in so let's say follow up in your question that if there's a violation so we somehow don't manage this appropriately that goes into our insurance ratings for blood flame management is that correct uh it can I've not seen that directly how that how that happens in a community but it is a factor in your um flood plane Insurance risk management rating your firm rating and I don't know that that's the right actor I was making and what happens with that I mean is that a is that some sort of federal program for which there are penalties or does that go into commercial carriers ratings what happens with that rating as I'm not an administrator I'm not in a position to intelligently speak to that beyond the you know the obvious statement that it if it affects your rating it can affect policies I don't know if that's at the at the consumer level or if that's in a you know they provide you know Bond rating you moody has now downgraded you I don't know honestly um but I I just know that there's been discussion there's often a discussion and barrier either communities about trying to maintain their firm rating for the discounts that are provided and and the rates that are provided and users and understanding member Banker's research and efforts on are we actually seeing these discounts and everything else I can't begin to complain on that um but that's generally my understanding I I don't have a more informed answer to give you as it's not my my role do you have something to well yeah generally yeah that's a pretty good explanation it's a point system and you you get points for doing certain things and once you get the different points that add up you get to different levels and the better the rating the better the insurance rates are for a community so the communities really fight to to keep those uh ratings in order to get the better rates for the residents on flood insurance okay so FEMA comes up with these ratings in part to implement National policy regarding our flood planes but then that rating is used commercially for setting insurance rates correct correct yeah and not and that's just one factor like I said it's it's one one Factor may not change your rating but because it is based on points but it all goes to the same thing and uh communities it is a valuable thing to have a better rating for the residents and just to note there is a national lawsuit against the nfy FEMA because they have proven that they haven't given these points and deductions and breaks to cities communities and which what you're trying to that's still they they've not revealed their formula their magic formula for determining how uh what those rates are thank the black box it's not published anywhere and no one can answer the question you just get it and not in a good way so um I I do have a little bit of apprehension about going to no uh no look back period and the reason why is because there's going to be there there's too much room for abuse uh we don't have the staff for continuous over and over projects on all these homes that have been waiting a long time um I think that moving to one year would be a good trial balloon to see if that's sufficient I understand that um in a storm sit ation a lot of things could happen but if it's one that's completely destroyed it's going to take a year to fix it anyway oh no AR and the other thing I wanted to point out is all these codes that we're reviewing will probably not going to get to council till late summer you know what I'm saying and I really think this should be addressed in a separ before before this season oh well that's that's uh that's possible yeah we can probably do that um I I don't I would advise the council to ignore the second strike out completely we this is a theme of Regulation it has to be in there whether it's zero one or five years or uh any time that we select uh you still have to rely on the 50% of fair market value so um just keep that in mind and U I'm in favor of one year and I think I agree and I think we there is if we do the one year and for some particular reason down we find out that didn't work the way we thought we thenit yes um can I ask what our neighboring generally do and secondly do we need a legal opinion that this would not in any way impact our grandfather I just always want to be we lost our grandfather no no no no she's referring to the short-term rental is that right does it mean do we touch anything regarding zoning or is it only regarding it's only regarding short-term rentals as long as we don't touch that and that's the ho Grail of code all right we just need to enshrine it and paint it on the walls um okay so it's that I can let that go it's just limited to shortterm city manager reer do you see any reason whatsoever that we that we should not switch to one year I mean just from a like a FL planing manager standpoint it's always better to have a longer look back because the the goal is to gets to build up not invest as much money where but build up or knock down and build up build up knock down change convert the bottom floor I mean there there's different methods but they're expensive um but so I can't say there definitely there's no benefit to having it um because there is a benefit for FL management but when it comes to just you know the big picture benefiting residents and letting them upgrade it we'd still be participants in the National flood insurance program would be violating anything there um like I said I I look back and we were not scored for the credit the credit that we earn for the 5year look back is not very significant and what do you think the impact will be on you and your staff with the additional permits it'll actually I mean I don't think you're going to see a large influx of permits just because of the look back R um it it actually is a burden for us because we have to track everything so a shorter look back is going to be easier for us be easier I okay does anybody have any objections to uh reducing it to one year so um what we can do is uh this is a work session um you know he's right it's probably not a bad idea just to go ahead and do an ordinance in the next work in the uh next council meeting and we just go ahead and get that one on the books because storm seon is com the the only um hesitation I have I got I'll double check with with uh Kyle on this is just making sure if anything in your code mandates that this kind of provision go before your Planning and Zoning Board before it go before you um that might be a limit to this getting to you quickly not as late as November um to be sure but um if you know if we have a meeting in like two or 3 weeks it may not be on that agenda if if the process requires to go before your pnz before it get to we'll confirm we'll just confirm the appropriate process so just in case if we didn't do it uh in the April meeting then it would be May June June because be have to do it twice so everybody good that okay good thank you again for raising this you're very welcome okay uh what else did we have now that we've gotten that one out of the way I had one right think these were some that we already discussed uh 94 six Landscaping uh mulch we talked about Mulch and the Damage that it creates whenever we uh have torrential downpours and flooding and things like that am I the only one with concerns I think we did we did discuss that and if I'm not mistaken I think Randy you brought up the part that to attempt to start black of better dictating the type of M as an example people should be using that may cause some issues in as much as I've apped on it on the past my advice was simply that as you don't presently regulate the substrate that is used doing so now could be perceived as a more burdensome or restrictive Land Development regulation Within Senate Bill 250 but more broadly as part of this discussion the general understanding of this process is most of what we're discussing here will not be brought to you for passage until after that period in Senate Bill 250 um lapses in October of 23 I mean of 24 um to my knowledge and I've been asking planning officials I was just on a call with some planning officials on Friday on another matter and asked if they were aware of anything in this current session that extended that um nobody's aware of it Lu to make sure there's you know these things get hidden in fun little places but absence some kind of extension of that moratorium will be able to do so come the fourth quarter of the year so nothing would prevent you generally speaking from moving forward with that of course you'll have to we will have to figure out how we want to administer that and you've got dozens of properties that already have that obviously we're not to be a nonconforming something um so we would have to talk about that but um yeah it's not something you just altogether prohibited from regulating it's a Time limitation on when you can begin the problem with it is U it gets into the storm sewers and goes into the goes you know everywhere it's got that depend on what color it is a lot it's ecology issue I've seen completely cover a neighbor's yard I've seen it completely cover the boat round I've seen completely cloged drains it's it's useful I I get it it's useful and it's something that many people rely on and is cheap compared to just about everything else but um is it something that we should seriously consider doing away with or putting a regulation on it and then you have to think about everyone already has it well are they allowed to replenish it as it deteriorates or is that it and and how do you police it punishing it would be tough to police it be kind of having to make a transition easier I think you will be getting more in there it would be hard to tell something that we might think about with issues such as this is is rather than having more laws maybe we can initiate more communication and education I think most people want to be good conservationists but they just don't know what to do like I never even thought about that the fact that they was die in in launch never thought about it so maybe we could use a committee somewhere or start launching some better educational material and and publish it get to the community in the words of the former city manager was my neighor when I was putting down the mulch in my yard he said you know that stuff floats and I said i' never thought of that and it did he says that's why we use shells and the uh as far as making more laws it's actually it would be less code than what we have now right now there's three paragraphs that cover this and you could sum it up with one sentence if you uh but you could also actually put in there why why it is you know it's the because of the flooding issues and the mess it makes and clogging and but I don't my only advice on this and this is not intended to sway the conversation but to inform it my only advice on this um and I'm going to rep repeat this in each of these discussions is the reminder of concerns about enforceability from your your staff's side and also whether in fact you wish for this to be enforced um because understand at some point somebody's going to come up to you and say mayor can you believe I got cited $125 cuz I put mulch in my front yard what's this about I thought this was free Florida and da da da da da and you and and as long as it's a value of this community and you can stand by that and say well it is but this is the reason and you think it's a good policy whatever that's fine but just be prepared to stand by Stand By and behind whatever you enact so you're not putting your staff in the position of well I was in well we never thought you were going to sight anybody we just wanted to kind of send the message well if we want to send the message on things and I'm not saying this is that but if it is then opportunities like education are usually a better way than you know $ 110 or $125 fine because you know somebody was gardening on a Saturday if that's your concern well so just I'm just again I'm not I don't have an opinion on it I just want to make sure we're clear on that as we go through and change things Well here here's where I'm where I'm at right now it does create a problem and right here in our code we're giving them instructions on what they're supposed to do with it which means we're inviting people in our code I would if if we're all about education and you don't want them to do it then I would recommend removing it completely that's if that's the stance the council wants to what section of you doing right now it's page yes along lines I I think possibly and we won't know until we do it this way but more of a recommendation as part of like a pamphlet that go out for the new homeowners or one on the website this is what we recommend and here's why we're recommending this you know instead of it being an actual enforceable code which is going to cause problems um I think a large percentage of our of our citizens would probably get on Bo of that just like Kim was referencing a lot of people don't know that it's a problem but if we had some type of a a document or information on our website that explain Landscaping requirements that was the use of mulch and why we don't recommend that necessarily they do make nonfloating mul I don't know how well it works I have seen that another word yeah but they they do make a type of U bark and mulge out there that theoretically is supposed to not float I actually used it when I was in Boots for a while because it was parts of my yard where it would puddle it stay I don't know how big of a storm it would take to move there but again I think U the education approach and recommendation approach of saying hey here's what we recommend here the products we recommend here's why we're recommending this and we would appreciate your help that because here's the problem it causes I think a lot of the people would go on board and I think mayor bring this to the council's attention puding 2 or of water and we in your street it's I don't care what it is like I said he said best some people have I think there's plenty of sites out there we can look through to determine what are the best materials to use in landscaping that aren't going to be subjected to floating well here's my here's my recommendation obviously we're it seems pretty hardcore to U say you can't put multi your I understand that and the only reason why I bring it up is because I saw what happened especially in your neighborhood on your street in your neighborhood on your street um I didn't see it so much where mine was at but I didn't flood so I would like let's just bypass this one for now let's add this to another work session and conversation and see if we can come up with some solutions I don't want to B the whole meeting down this one topic I had I had two more that are on page 34 and that was dealing with the number of stories I'm so sorry page 34 that was dealing with a number of stories uh with homes being built code you know what it says on there is what it is un49 94299 p 26 wow it's funny Adobe Market is Page 34 anyway uh so what it was was under Heights um the first recommended change was changing two to three habitable stories alongside a garage or storage area so that would be making use of the space that you're not supposed to use if you have a three-story home uh then right behind that is or um you add insert two over a garage or storage area so you're still limited to three stories even if you don't make the bottom story habitable does that make sense yeah so two above the garage or three from the garage level does it change anything the overall overall height Remains the Same okay you're making more taxable square footage in the same box the one thing that did change the overall height is when we adopted the P building code for the one three board because our height code is based off of the base flood elevation but there's base flood elevation and then there's the design flood elevation that's included in the freeboard so given that um we could adjust our height code be based on the design FL elevation supposed to the base FL elevation it kind of get shorted a foot because you're only going 35 ft above whatever your map says BF is but you got to design what you have to go at least one foot higher for your local FL so just something that changed when you adopted that reboard that we might want so instead of 35 it would be 36 um just say um B 35 above the DF in of D because the DF can change based on doesn't includ start did you get that I did yeah and and that's uh that's more how more communities do it based on a design flood okay the tower was inside and so that was three stories or two stories the two stories are above the garage or three stories are beside the garage and so an example of two stories would be where you're in a lower elevation and you can go two stor above your that's all I had how about you well the artificial turb synthetic grass cuz I just went across that relatively recently we address that and we wrote it was like 22 so that that should be pretty good I believe that we had any issues come up with that no since then I've had two new homes use artificial tur I've been following you know the screening from the road and you know they front they have to have yeah so we've been we've been following it um the one thing I'm have to pay close attention to is there was a there was a a section there talked about if you already have it and within so many years you yeah get it yeah the only thought I had when I read it because I know we spent a decent amount of time making sure that this that's for the C I think it is the way it was written it is written um but I thought of M because he was actually allergic to grass and that was that was the main reason that he had artificial grass so my thought is why do we actually have that part of the code in there discussing the front yard only that you can only have it in the front yard it's used at 4 in maximum spaces between blocks and things like that as opposed to if somebody was I mean that that to me sounds like a legitimate reason why you wouldn't want grass real grass anywhere around you if you're really allergic to but I was just curious why did we why wouldn't why would we allow the artificial turb that meets our restrictions as the type of in the sides and the back obviously the back is probably not seen but the front we allow it but only in a manner that we're going to have it between loocks that just seems like a lot of work why wouldn't we allow some of the houses toally I was just CU Aesthetics trying to create c um cruising right along and all a sudden this crazy looking that stands right guessing that's why why that happened all right I was just when I was reading that through again interesting but you're right on the other side of the street we see the artificial you know on the side it says it can be there but you can use me uh you can screen it with Landscaping world over there I just wonder how the drainage because I we have we say it's considered Pur but it is did you have other the fences if you recall I was just here a little while and I was replacing a wooden fence that was that need to be replaced and at the time I spoke with someone that said well if you're replacing an existing fence that's beond with a new fence and if it's not the same material it required permit and is that we already changed that CU I didn't see that disc go around because I was replacing a wooden fence with a vinyl fence and we had just a brief discussion and I think decision was made did not re even though it was using a different material f it was going in the exact same place yeah exact same I think with fences you have to be careful if if it's a repair as is kind like a dock the boards it's fine it's the same but if you're switching material then what if you're switching the height different areas yeah have a lot I have a good example as to why that would be and I may be wrong but this would be my guess whenever the county comes out and they inspect is the county right County does a wall because a wall okay okay who inspects the actual so you inspect it a certain way and you verify that the post is in the ground there's concrete BL but you also look at the way that it's attached you take a forign type of say a Hy plastic or something like that it's not going to attach the you're not going to nail it in so how how are you going to do that and I think what it is is is that if you're you can repair it but you need to put it back the way that it was insed unless you change the whole thing right that's that's what I was do at the time the only reason I brought it up I couldn't find that this time and and you had showed me before uh when I was talking to you that placeing the fence that there was information that stipulated using a different Mater you're replacing an entire vence and it was made of wood and you're tearing the wood down anding up different product that that would require think any fence replacement I don't know about I thought you could repair a small section but I didn't think you could tear out your entire fence and put it back up without a permit inspection how about neighbor a has a wooden fence doesn't to CU my first question to my neighbor I didn't know who F I said is this my f or your fence and because it was falling down I said EV did did he go in with your CL no all good good neighbor but um that again when I was reading it through this time maybe was in a different code where address that um faing an entire things I didn't see it this this go through not a big deal I was just wondering I know it discusses exact materials you can use um one thing I always advise people when they're placing a fence or changing things around you really should have a servant or at least have company locate The Monuments for the property you'd be surprised what you think is yours is not yours at all you don't have a survey for the house you should be on someone else's property anything else um we can move on to somebody else okay all right I have quite a few questions just in terms of questions what your experience um so one is uh sheds have we had any issues with sheds and is that something we need to think about in terms of our ordinance it's uh 110 we haven't had any major issues with what we have on the books now there was a when they made the code for the shed that is our only additional um structure you you're lot on your property as far as accessory building is the shed and it's you got very defined rules on size height um wind rating and it also I think set something along the line of if you already had a shed that didn't didn't inform the so when they when that got put in place uh the previous city manager he really went through and eliminated a lot of the viations that were whether it was was step back whether you can see it from the road whether you have multiple sheds so I I think after that first sweep it hasn't been an issue I think it's a good SE code okay good uh 206 deals with wood frame construction and I thought this was interesting in that it can be constructed a building can be constructed with basically a party says is okay and what has our experience been with that and is that too broad of a of a delegation to a third party I'd have to check this with somebody who know buing Cod while it might might get Trump by code okay because it says it's basically it says that you use wood so long as it's of the type that a structural engineer or licensed architect says it's okay so I'm sure somebody that wants something questionable can do some shopping among Architects and Structural Engineers who find an opinion that suits them is that okay or have we had any problems we have any problems um usually especially with the engineers like the structural engineers you know they their license if they're willing to sign off it's on them right um earth worms are prohibited I was just wondering why in a is on page 37 item 21 Earth firms are not permitted I just wondering why some people use that as a landscaping technique a little we isn't is that what we're talking about some sort of little with a tree on it and some plantings or what can you share anything on that what's the section number um it is 21 page 37 yeah it's under uh 251 sub 21 I think my page number it's 37 page 37 I'm thinking it's related to drainage I was just wondering why it's there I I'm not a rooms I just don't know why it's probably to keep your neighbor from putting a big he that would be my guess okay it's not been a problem I guess um is there anything in our code which would address Landscaping of the type that we see occasionally where people kind of put in a desert landscape you know they basically get rid of Z the landcap yeah do we care about that is that we have several of them around town do we like them do we do we not that issue reduction in water usage Swift lights Swift lights a lot yeah the only problem we have is at one point they were installing the underneath the The Rock oh no be and I think that's a maintenance issue too that the start up and you might I mean it looks like everybody's doing it well now but yeah because even if you do put a barrier for weeds EV eventually you're going get enough organic material en fors and then you start putting more chemicals on which is not good does anybody have any thoughts about that know it's hard to stick a flag oh I my hammer you I I haven't I haven't heard any complaints um section 255 we have um a requirement that if a project exceeds $20,000 you have to get an appraisal um what's been our experience I personally would either be fine with getting rid of that uh because we're tracking this anyways um and the way it's worded is it says you know you're required to get an appraisal not you have uh property the structure is worth a lot of money and you are try to do something minimal to like like replace the window or something and you just you want to use what the property appr has for the Fe 50% value I think that's very reasonable as opposed to you know you're trying to do you know all doing window replacement a lot most window jobs now are over $20,000 and um have to go on top of it exactly how old is this pretty old early 9s just uh being The Devil's Advocate how how would you track what the value of the upgrade is we we track it because you have to write the value of the permit as it comes through so we have we we typically use 20,000 as a marker um to to look into the history some more um but when it comes to getting an appraisal just that that's a burden to Residents um if we are doing a uh we're going to be doing the substantial Improvement affid anyways um for you know whe they're going to get a value right um it's just whether I mean requiring that they do an appraisal for some there's a lot of people that just want to impr house so I'm trying to figure out how the county is going to establish a taxable value for another it sounds like this is that's what this is in here for so that they can establish that but are they not doing that now I I don't believe so because we're we're just using appraisals as an option because if you us what the property appr says for Value you're not going to get as much as you so we we allow it a little bit more see you're asking would they use that actual number as as a tool to add to the appraisal value account I don't think they're they're pulling those numers from somewhere you's value on every project that's done on the permit side of things whenever I look at at the I go to the property show shows all the things that have been done and there's a cash value out to the side they're using that's probably what this is talking about can you add anything this no ma'am I cannot I think that's the property uh calculations for so that the work is permanent and attracting value of the permit at the very bottom and then as they reevaluate the structure of the property and whatever was done to it they're calculating that I just wonder where they get the number that they're plugging into that the value of the project per you can get a permit on a project but times are you over budget something doesn't something doesn't go right or I've noticed that typically those values are low of course of I think everything um that they apprais the property tends to be on the yeah I'm fine with it you know everyone else yeah it just seems like a burden people don't need one more they don't need and the last thing that I have is that I assume we're going to have some sort of discussion on antennas and Towers I don't think that's an issue for anybody here I'm joking had that discussion yeah we have had um some of that discussion I will tell you as recently as the last few days I even exchanged correspondence with the u lawyer who had represented the gentleman through the last process first thanking him for facilitating his client coming into compliance with the existing code but also asking um if there were any samples he offered not because we would fully endorse necessarily their approach but again to give us the full complement of information as we consider what revisions we want to implement but uh that is an issue we are um certainly tuned into on what structural limitations we want to provide and making sure if we are going to reasonably accommodate amateur antenna radios as Federal Law requires that we have clear criteria rather than leaving it up to guesswork on how that'll be navigated I brought up about height and take this the wrong way but you could give like a definition you know how high is now that I'm at 60 ft can I go 120 for sure so40 so the Challen the challenge with this is much like when we discuss variances right in in in variance paraments when you're seeking a variance one of the things in our code and in most codes that you have to establish and I think Mr s will speak to this as well is that it's the minimum variance necessary so in our code we can have a presumptive limitation of some reasonable height let's say we allow flag poles to be 25 ft or something like that so we say okay fine 30 ft is generally allowed other than that we can't say absolutely nothing over 30 ft we can say 30 ft is the limit but you may be able to get a variance if you can establish a b and c when you look at federal guidelines one of the things that says is you can have a height limit but if they can establish that 40 ft is the minimum height necessary to operate and receive signals for that amateur radio antenna a city is likely going to have to make that reasonable accommodation now if they can accomplish that at 40 ft but they're looking to go to 65 I know 45 the number you might want 65 but you've proven that you know we've established the 40 is what you need so when when we talk about the amateur radio antenna Towers one I I I don't want to give this an outsized amount of attention in this process and in the 30 years there's been one that's proven a challenge and that doesn't I don't mean to diminish the concern for those that property owner who attempted to erect it and his neighbors and their respective concerns but it is not as though this is a you know great issue in our community that's proliferated in a way the way some other communities are dealing with short-term rentals for example but if we're going to regulate we should do it intelligently with an eye towards what the regulations are so at the risk of beating the dead horse yes we are aware of that we are trying to craft it in a way that is cognizant of and compliant with modern state and federal standards and the challenges with telecommunications especially is those preemptions keep growing sure well so my general questions were one was it seemed like the one problem that we did have stem from the fact that that particular application ended up being an antenna right the whole thing was considered an antenna it has more to do and and and I can speak to you me Miss Elliot just because you do have a legal background there's a bit of a legal fiction that the Tower and the antenna once joined are function one and an antenna and our code treated those as differently and in fact before I received any meaningful guidance from or information from opposing Council if you will in this process I looked at our code and said our code treats a tower and antenna separate things but once you start to look at how the case law actually treats them and how communities are often overturned the legal fiction is once the tower is mounted to the antenna they are it is all considered the intend so anyway how do we address that going forward would be one of my questions you know how do we get sensitive to that so somebody doesn't put up yet another one and the other observation I is are there any prohibitions of leasing that space or that capability so let's say someone has erected a large antenna and's using it for their handam radio operation but they start putting microwaves on it and selling it to the you know a satellite K company or something is there anything that would prohibit a commercial use of it well I think at at the point that you put a commercial use then you immediately remove it from the scope of being an amateur radio antenna um I can think of other situations that I'd rather not provide a road map to in this context that I'd be happy to discuss with you privately that we may not be able to necessarily prevent or limit um but generally speaking it would have to remain an amateur radio Anna Tower within FCC guidelines and one one of those is that it is not used for commercial purposes um so if you start um leasing the real estate that is the antenna itself to say oh now you can put a satellite dish on here and a you know a Time Warner can do this and all that then I I think we would have an argument that it's no longer an amateur radio antenna tower or at least exclusively being used in a way that's consistent with those regulations we can certainly if we're going to get into that that that level of um proactive regulation we can you know say that it shall be limited to the imager and not provide you know vertical access if we start once we start drafting language we can definitely be sensitive to that yeah that that would be my here's my problem 20 minutes ago we were talking about the height of the house 35 yes sir okay so why can't I build my house 60 ft before allowing because there's not federal regulations preempting our regulation of the issue I mean it's it's it's a simple as we are in in the hierarchy of of of government authorities we are baby brother and so if big brother is going to tell us otherwise then we just got to follow those rules I mean that's really the the simplest distillation of it is is the state and the federal guidelines told us you cannot place an absolute limit I'm not saying we can't place a limit if we do place a limit we just have to recognize we may later have to have some reasonable accommodation there's no similar guidance for a residential structure right at least not yet knock on whatever the closest thing to being wood is um but so um I guess to put an end to this portion of the conversation Le is going to fix it and I'll just pass whatever more restrictive in this particular case they should be is that right or is it that our code works just fine but he's going to shore it up a little bit so that we better understand what we're up against my honest assessment is your code can use Improvement there were a lot of ambiguities in this process that we the fact that we had the search code to determine is this a structure is it within a setback are there site liit like we should be able to better Define that and it we presented one of the delays in the permitting process was trying to tell the applicant what this is and is not within our code I think we can improve our code and in improving our code bring it more into compliance with the modern Parliament and and regulation and we probably would have been able to do that sooner had a certain individual actually applied for a right I mean that that was part of the process there was you know and but I I think honestly if my personal reflection as a City attorney I'm glad that the gentleman is in compliance now but I think that this was also a testament to how well-run your city is because the gentleman came into the code enforcement process saying I'm not applying for a permit cuz they're just going to deny me and no one's going to take my permit seriously and instead that's exactly what this community did you did a very detailed review of your regulations applied the ones that you could voiced your concerns with the permitting officials about the things you couldn't regulate but wanted to make sure they were addressed they were addressed to all regulating authorities limits and they ultimately got the permit that they thought was impossible I think that's a testament to this community doing its job and serving its residents so yes to the to the extent he assumed it was futile that delay the process um but similarly to the extent it was assumed that we could stop this and in a moment ago Miss Miss Elliot you suggested you know as long as we can we can stop this we can't stop this we can regulate it better um but I cannot promise you that if even after we amend our code if somebody comes with an application that they will not be able to regulate an amateur radio antenna because the law strongly favors the ability to do that no I understand that and I see that both for your benefit but also the record if you will anything else M Elliot no thank you okay Mr Baker two points raised and IED satisfied I all right very welcome Mr reer um some of the things I just brought up um M was a nonstructural fil may have WR some guidelines on that um say that one more time please non structural fill okay where you know people are bringing in or they're putting their seaall caps and they're filling up their yards um and causing a big difference between the yard yard using the uh the um kind of wall That's not meant to be a retaining wall as a retaining wall in some situations so that's something I want to look into I wanted to look into FL poles CU we don't anywhere in the code really Define where a FL pole can be yeah um we had some of it in the sign but I think this also crosses over into the zoning because it's the place it is um we have a restriction we were talking about then we mentioned before and we'll we'll come up with something the uh the hedges and the plants in in the front set back um taking into consideration some like theold SA we could make exceptions for um but I think that was more you wanted us to craft the Lang should be bring to you um I think it would be in this section but maybe some basic guidelines of holiday decorations and not try to create a whole bunch of r rul but maybe having some rules they to be down within 3 months of the holiday or we did recently talking about the giant balloon the giant balloons yeah I mean I don't think it was a danger to anyone but people may not want to do that all certain it's bigger than the house I know people drive mil just to see I got I got a NE I take my from he decorates his whole I mean nothing fa and right after Christmas they're down right after Christmas that's a good thing people go just look at that would be great you're saying you guys put something together yeah about that you I I would say that my my opinion on I have two opinions one is that leing Li up for a long long time maybe is that a free speech thing is are you speaking whenever you're throwing light color lights I mean there's definitely a free speech analysis that would have to be done I'm not I'm not saying that it would be absolutely protected by the First Amendment um you know when you start getting into design Aesthetics Free Speech comes up as a concern and again maybe you have lights on but then they put one up that says like stop the war and they use Christmas lights so now that analysis is different um but you know the the the caution again against the the line between an ho community on regulating Aesthetics I really don't think it's a big problem in Beach year round lights the giant balloon in high winds does worry me a little bit I mean culturally it's just also you know they are marketing and selling more things like this right like we're as we get into Halloween there's skeletons that are now the size and then Home Dep just announced the skeleton's going to have a dog that's roughly the same size that you can buy so you know know um it's also these these things can sometimes be cyclical in terms of thats I put out 35 small decorations we need to put out one GI anything else um there was a couple things I brought up with the Flor area ratio that we're going to look into just defining that um cuz when you're building You're Building like over a store garage storage area and you're building two stories above um the weights defined right now in the code is saying that you have to count the garage storage area in your ratio can't be so severely limit you and how big so we're kind of we're looking into that better definition um just a little bit more metion of generators what's the uh what about generators really just getting them talked about I they've been interpreted as the same encroachment uhet like you can have your indexer but just to have it in there yes like I mentioned before I wanted to look into I don't know if this can be done um in any specific way but where we have side back side sorry side set backward um exemptions um or exceptions in uh B State Island if there's something we can do with the making possibly more reason for someone put KN you know some kind of consideration for the lots that have with i u obviously I'm going through this process right now I've put a lot of thought into it um I think much it pains me to say it I think the reason why they have the 12T setback is because you can get a big boat in there and what if your neighbor wants a big boat too and it's less than 24 ft now may be creating conflict now you want to reduce it I'm all for it we're on both that sies but I'm just saying that may be why it's 12 ft anyone have thoughts on that speaking of big vill we've had the largest I've seats here's a 65 footer um that um off of you know one of the water Lots okay um but there was no code violation there were some neighbors that were concerned they couldn't see anything back anymore um but there wasn't an actual code violation or any kind of Na a of the Waterway so I don't know if that's something we want to think about a maximum length you know it's uh it's not too far out there where it's at uh but I can understand concerns U what about theal [Music] r I and he saying is there Mr attorney sir is there an answer to thatal rights on the bay loral rights on the bay um my short answer would be to defer back to the discussion we had when there was some concern about the number of boats in the Waterway which is to say the city does not regulate the water Waterway so once the boats are in the water that's not really our purview yeah but what I'm saying is it's blocked I I this guy has a 65t boat I live here I can't see to the left you know yeah you have no right to view left and right of your property and that is a consistent issue that comes up in coastal communities whether it's hey they they put up palm trees now or they put up a sculpture that I don't like the look of and now I can't see the sunset the way I used to you have no right to a view across your neighbor's property you can you can look straight out and even as you're straight out only because in some of these Coastal communities we have what have alternative been described as fingers or you know a series of of of cacs that view each other while you have a right straight out you don't have a your right straight out stops at that next property line so you don't have a right straight out to then govern what you can see on the neighbor's property across the water um but you know of course somebody can't come and build a wall at the rear of your sea to block you but you can't say I used to enjoy the sunset in the East and now they've put up a slide for their kids and I can't that's not a thing no I appreciate the question it's a common question and and and also a common assertion made and leis I don't mean to to draw you into this too much but from a planner's perspective does that come up for you often the arguments about regulating across the property yeah yeah that's always a discussion at permitting and things like that but yeah you're right as long as it doesn't get into sight triangles closer to the roadway then it's not a thing but that's not what you're talking about water side yeah as large as a 65t craft is it's actually not causing any problems as far as the water sorry I misunderstood the question I think if you were going to look into something like that maybe it would be per as you're going into these these baby Harbors you know okay how much clearance do you have on each side and it looks to me like the way they design they about all the way around so maybe if you took another 65 footer and put it directly across the Harbor from it then how much room do you have left I don't know that's another that's another question um it's a unique circumstance for sure uh and then lastly uh I talked about this with Lou with the um the multif family homes we we currently have our code that the if you put like a wall or fence on the on the property it's supposed to stop before the sea cap um proba um Lou that it's common that that's something we could change that other communities allow that I guess you know it's obviously to kind of prevent people from walking over to caps across property lines um I'm not opposed to it and the reason why is because people have dogs resal same deal that's the way you can contain your dog yeah currently we Define the property line rear property line as inside to the seaw wall what like looking to make an exception CU people have done it allowing the the fence or wall to extend um just to make it just to keep people from crossing over yeah and and make it you know allow in our code so it doesn't become an issue cuz right now it says you're supposed to stop at the inside if you were if you were to break it all down right anything else that is it for 94 that was far less painful than I expected it that's pretty good sir do you have any questions for us no no I was going to say the same thing got some good comments good notes I think we got a lot to work with good do we have anything else for okay is there any I'm sorry is there any update on the U potential ques that's other business one more thing we talk about it it comes up in the history I just recently uh spoke with about um the observation using a flat roof to have an observation or an access um Larry said in history they did not allow them um because if there was anything on that top of the roof like say electrical outet anything that like a utility they would consider it to be habitable space they wouldn't allow it unless it was only habitable so if you just have one story habitable and then you have observation a lot of people are proposing building the houses with access to the roof with you know not doing anything on that top like putting water access or electricity or anything like that SI so just just have access to right so um that's something I'd like to figure out weow or well now you've just made it 40 ft 50 ft because you're going to have humans standing up there so now it's even higher and you know they're going to put a table up there or chairs something is going to be up there so now we're going even higher um address a even that we don't make roofs that are flat is SL some way but do we address that anywhere in our code in our building code we we don't have anything against the it's just there's nothing that says it really addresses having like that observation Point um in the past they had said no because someone they can tell from the plan somebody was trying to run have a bar up there sure but if they just have like paits and access I don't know if they I don't know it's not been a problem I don't know if we would be creating a problem by setting regulations um I know in a more mod type of architecture just see that more want just see that you know driving around our city I don't know if I've seen too many houses that have a consider a move that I'm leaning on all of this even even the the reluctance of changing the the uh elevation level um it makes sense what you proposed um but at the end of the day we're little by little we're taking away what makes Beller be so special we're a small quiet sleepy little Beach Community and every time one of these little homes is knocked down and built up um it's it's great for somebody but is it great for everyone and that's that's what worries me about us eventually becoming something that we don't recognize anymore so I will always lean towards anything that that puts a cap on how high we can go and what you can do with it once you build it that high so I would I would discourage U everyone from being uh Pro Rooftop Bar that's why to be address if we don't do something we're going to lose that goldity this is like you said end up withit first I'm having trouble even understanding this from a safety standpoint because if it's flat roof as youve mentioned it's going to be sloped in some fashion just because it has to drain so are you building something on top of it and then is there a railing once you get into a ra I mean people AR just going to sit on a roof some sort of structure around where they're sitting we don't have a minimum like half to half to 12 in pitch or anything like that we don't have I've heard there's communities that don't allow flers I think we probably got what a few handful um flat flat you got small this is what I think I I think that if you build a full three stories you can't you can't use your roof as a standing surface if you build two full stories from the ground or from your garage level well then sure you can build a nice little over hangout spot it's still St but I say I just firmly keep believe that if you open that Pandora's Box then you're really giving them four stories now and and that's what it's going to look like they going to have walls up there and you know handrails and everything else I just I don't that's not what I want see Beach yeah like try to conversion forward right so if you feel that you need to put something in the code that that protects us from that we just go for it we'll look at it we I think because that would be a great feature bu for the seriously you know what I'm saying to rent something out and I think okay anything else before we move on all right Le I appreciate it all right yeah thank you thank you thank you all all right now we're on to other business and um Floyd had brought it up I was going to bring it up too was uh currently we have two applicants uh for the uh for our council member positions we don't know how many council members we need until tomorrow was today the official last day that we are taking or is it does it end tomorrow I can't remember I believe it ends tomorrow okay it ends tomorrow so if anyone knows anyone that would like to possibly serve on Council and would like to be considered a Nomine they need to get in their appliation tomorrow last this the end and we're cutting it off um after after all the applications are in would you make sure that everyone gets a copy what we've got um currently we only have two I originally wanted to do a miniature work session and and we just bring them in and we hash all that out um in a work session V for in the meeting but I don't see any reason to bring them in twice I think we can we can contact them individually ask them questions and then uh at our next meeting we will we vote for whatever is required of us right now it's three but it could be one I'm hoping I have a I have faith that we're only going to need one person and uh will from May mayor I just want to make sure I'm clear on when when we're talking about the numbers um if the voters approve all of the proposed Charter amendments there is a phasing from seven seats to five seats and that does not happen immediately I just want to be clear about that obviously this Council can decide what it does with that information um if someone applies you're under no obligation to appoint that person whether you deem qualified or if you think they're appropriate fit um but I just want to make clear that and and again we will once we know the um results of the election I will later this week provide some guidance on what does all this mean now once I can make heads or Tales of it but the as written the ordinances and resolutions contemplate a a date certain not immediate where we would transition from 7 to 5: formally right um so you you will still have seven seats on your Council come Friday regardless of what happens on but whether you choose to fill those seats is a different question interesting so okay I'm I'm a little confused but it's all right yeah I I think I can even me succinctly uh address this because I'm also eager to turn if there's no other business but um the way that it was done was you're you're switching to let's say everything is approved you're going to have an election in your next election would be November I think of [Music] 20266 and I think it was at the November 2026 election I'm not certain of this but I think it was at that election that you phase down to five um and so that's what I saying so you would still be seven people until that date whether or not you choose to fill seven vacancies is a different question the challenge you face again is you know having more for that time gives you the flexibility as it relates to quorums and other issues but as the ordinances were written we were phasing on that election cycle of memory serves and again um I I'm going from my memory it's been a while but I know it was not hey come April suddenly were a council five because we needed to appropriately phase that in relationship to the election Cycles so is it possible for the council to only nominate one and bring in one you could you could decide to appoint none either of them you could fill zero you could fill one you could fill all of them that's ultimately your purview as the charter task you with filling vacancies and I've been part of commissions where they've said no I don't want they've had 10 applicants and said I don't want any of them um that's ultimately your purview um and whatever you know obviously different choices have different consequences in terms of how you operate but um ultimately it is your call on who is and who's not appointed Mr Rober so the way I understand it then so November of 26 um have we been a full counil the seats that would have come up then would be the mayor seat my seat um whoever is in Jody's seat I kind of lost track and whoever's in Mike seat wouldn't that have came up in 20125 would have all yeah but what I'm saying is can you do that um since since they ran on 3 years actually yes the way the way it the way it was all written and closed both to the electorate and in the ordinances resolutions yes and yes the way it was contemplated was there whereas normally there would be I think it was four seats on that particular election cycle we would only be filling two or something like that whatever whatever the math was and again forgive me I've not looked at it in in its specifics but that was and I think I've made a joke about this in the past I had a beautiful mind it on the white Bo and Kyle's office to make it all make sense but yes that was how he faced it now her you're good no no when would that cycle come that would come up in 28 yes that's my recollection because the way we if if everything is approved by the voters you're going to be on federal election cycle so You' be on the presidential it would not quite kick in for this one be the next midterms and then the next presidential election midterms and the next Presidential I just didn't know if it was wful to if you ran on a threeyear ter elected through a threee well and we we had an extensive discussion I understand saying I didn't know you could actually get a year well the voters are giving you whatever time you're getting you're getting from the voters you're not getting by F so that's what the voters specifically are approving your term of office and that was one of the concerns with this was you're running and you will not know until election day when your term what your term is and that was one of the challenges and we we like an additional six months by go to November of 28 as opposed to because three years a four year plus and that's why at the risk of confusing everybody this week I will send you a summary once we know what is what from the voters because all of this is very academic until we know precisely what happens well this is my recommendation don't have to agree with it I'm open to everyone's opinion but having an even number of council members U is a mistake we don't have right now we have two candidates or two nominees um and we might get we might get a third I don't like just okay everyone showed up and because you're here let's vote you in I think the goal I believe everyone is in agreement with the five council members as as a council we can just we can say let's pick one let's pick the very best and we just we run on five until everything changes over and then it's a natural cycle I think that that would uh it serve our city better and we would have um less potential for problems thoughts well we're eliminating to get pass REM so only one person shows up is that correct uh if all of the charter measures pass this specifically contemplates that three members shall constitute a quorum and you need a majority vote of the SE Council to approve a measure I thought we were to I don't remember the precise phrasing of it but it just it may be a majority but this whether or not we eliminate the word Quorum as a matter of pun of parliamentary procedure procedure Quorum is always an issue right I've got the ballot thatum is three if you're word app because the ballot language is less than what the 75 words the resolution has all the actual has all the actual regards to who seed it is based on when that se comes up for elction well I don't think that's that's a problem now you just explained it well me you just told you you're 27 no and then there's got to be would theoretically if we got to P seven there would be two other seats that would come on the 26 as well jod and mik and jod and Mike seats are tied to people on my concern is as we continue this dialogue not only will we serve to confuse ourselves but the electorate um you know ultimately it's your discussion but I think it whe How how we proceed to fill and do anything would probably be best served once once we know how it works okay well we'll we'll continue this conversation later then um any other General business no would like to go home motion you have a second all in favor I any opposed all right great job everyone excellent yes"
