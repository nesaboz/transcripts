    "transcript": "going to call this meeting to order it's uh Monday December the 18th 2023 6: p.m. this is the city council work session for the city of b beach uh please rise and join me the Pledge of Allegiance Pledge Al to the F of the United States of America and the repu for which it stands one nation under God indivisible justice for all Rene would you please call the role council member Frank Banker present council member Mark Chester here council member Kim Shaw Elliott president Council I'm sorry mayor Dave gtis president vice mayor jod Shirley here city manager Kyle reer here okay and uh I'm assuming everyone saw the letter from council member NATO right yes okay all right okay uh Frank you had some something you were discussing uh with uh that you that you wanted to discuss well I was just discussing about the storm this past weekend and I know Kim was Kim's not in town so I was concerned about her property because properties's on my street some of them took water in again uh streets around me took water in again and and I believe we only had two and a half inches of turtle rain um but I asked people that were living on the in coastal they said that we just push that water right over the seaw wall again and one guy said to me he thinks when they put the new ramp in at Seventh Street they compromised it that it's too low now or whatever he say because he right on the corner he that water was just coming right up the ramp I don't know ler now I don't think it's any lower yeah I mean it's a long once it goes down and there's a long pitch you know uh I don't I don't know what the grade of the pitch is coming to the streets but um it was a mess um and that wasn't even a stormstorm all right um we have one item on the agenda this is a presentation from MWI pumps uh I'm assuming this is Kelby Morgan and Bill Miller welcome gentlemen thank you I'm just gonna hand the floor right over to you and if you would just step up to the podium and uh for the record give us your name and who you're with and uh do you have a way we can connect to a screen or anything by chance what program you um just power um you can I have HDMI connection um if you don't have it can you can put it can I HDMI into yours yeah yeah this mic is on on yes yeah while he's setting up my name is Bill noer appreciate you all letting us come over and talk to you um we're from Bureau Beach that's where we actually live in our offices our sales offices there um were several pump companies in one now uh they MWI has purchased companies over the years so U we've got lots of experience with uh different styles of pumps from water fountains to flood control uh to water treatment plants and Mr Miller hold on one second yes Kim are you able to hear I am thank you for checking I'm fine okay I just wanted to make sure he's a little far away from the microphone that's that be just anyway we've got a lot of experience and uh we've done a lot of different types of jobs we've done uh lots of jobs similar to what you all may or may not see fit to do in your area um Kel a presentation that will go through some of the stuff that some of it will be almost a footprint of what we could do we Haven an actually seen your site um but there's just a few ways to get rid of water you know when you're trying to get it to a a tide that's higher than than uh your property is and you have to pump it so anybody questions we might not have the answer tonight but we can get the answer we just had a storm um and once again some of the houses got flooded out uh but we didn't get the water out of the street till almost 8: a.m. Sunday that was when the tide was Z NE negative 0.1 negative 0.1 is when that finally right dissipated all right now did start going down it never these vs never really open till they hit about the twoot level once that two foot level is there it just whatever whatever comes down in from the sky stays in the street right so we had we had I think you talked to Gemini engineering we did we spoke with them okay yeah haven't met him yet but we did speak with okay I think are you Frank yes all right I you yeah but um I believe you guys told me you could do a pump that would do about 2400 gallons a minute yeah our our pumps range in a variety of sizes we start around 8 in we've got some pumps that are pumping around 1,000 gallons 12200 gallons a minute on up to large 120,000 gallons a minute um which are large yeah but kby I think's ready to almost almost ready but I think uh one of the one of the a lot of the systems have gravity out to the ocean until it's too high so a lot of pump stations are put in and there's a separate gravity line still there or some stations the gravity lines are on either side you know a block on either side of where the station is so um you know they're not taking up a lot of space real estate's expensive so we try to condense as much as we can sometimes the pump stations are actually in the road and your discharge is running down between the property line easement on out to the ocean and they have Gates on them that stop anything coming back well this probably was too dark you pull in here but our basketball court the order came right up to just about that well it sounds like you're in a good position to start planning on options um some places uh you know don't have don't give themselves enough time to plan and they put in a great station and within 10 years it's not doing you know it can't do all the work that they needed to do but Kell be old hit on we've got a lot of different materials we design and build pumps out of stainless deal is what we generally use when we're on the water um we have other products and they don't hold up with the salt and you end up you know servicing them often which is expensive and replacing them much sooner we've got some pumps in Hilton Head I think they're 24 years old and they just started replacing them only because they think they need to replace them pumps are still working but they think they've they're getting closer to the end of their life how are they generate electric they're electric they're electric uh they're electric submers actually some of the stations have generator backups and uh some don't a lot of times they'll have a generator maybe if there's three or four pumps in a station they might have generator to run one of them not all of them so you need to speak up into your mic just so everybody can hear because we can't have the conversation so go ahead so dur from the storm I was out of state how did we do with our sand that we bought the sand I would say one quarter of it wow maybe maybe one quarter of it washed away Indian Rocks they did much worse I talk to somebody today at the airport yeah yeah now I I will say this that there's been uh several complaints from condo owners and the hotel owner that uh the dun was higher than they anticipated they didn't like these no it's slower they didn't like the the no it's not it's still still just as high but here's what my prediction is is that as that starts uh it's going to fall and whenever that does it's going to be more beach sand and as long as we don't another um very rare dangerous storm like we just had um that I've heard from some people that we've not had a storm like that in the month of December in 50 years made national news we in Georgia well if you talk to like weeks engineering or any big dredging companies in it they'll say dring 10 you restore the beach first and then put to put fast growing oats well you have to put you have to put a beach to absorb the water well I'll stand with it's Mother Nature you're putting sand where it wasn't and this is the process this is what happens if you're pulling sand out of the ocean and pumping it on the beach guess what it's going right back out to the that's that's why the contracts every five to seven years but we didn't do it until right8 had the great storm in galvaston when they had the great storm in galvaston they raised the whole island and it took them like 10 years yeah I brought that up in a me what I like about it is that's the worst storm ever so the idea that storms are getting worse yeah that's years ago yeah since then they LED that seaw wall by oh yeah but they raed the whole island up and then they put that big seaw wall in and it's like a kind of a big train you have to have something to retain to put a wall you see the that's pretty impressive we used to live well they put an artificial reath if you look at the map in the that retained a lot of sand but it still didn't get a beach until so whenever you were referring to A.1 um tide um The Surge was so bad that at that point it was almost over my dock so if it been anything but a super low tide you would have had big problems well the tide projected I think was coming in at 2.9 ft before the storm and I don't know what the tide came in actually at a big difference well the big difference that I noticed was that this one was stained whereas Adalia was in and out yeah it was it was a short storm so um even though water stayed I think that this situation was actually worse yeah for longer too um our lower part our do was completely that's now that's something Flo water but this is that's under water I can also tell you that that we weren't alone I drove down Clear Water Beach and there was sand all over the street there was there sand everywhere yeah I know I um well they canel everything on Sunday could open but then I to some on fingers and they said they're just down on those fingers so definitely not as everyone dealt with it because when you have Tides coming in like that there's nothing you can do about it you can't pump it out to tight it's SL seaall doesn't doesn't solve the problem well I disagree well they'll they'll tell us they're the experts New Orleans had a bunch of pumps fail big ones big pump stations talking about Katrina Katrina didn't even hit norleans very hard it went up Mississippi what they got was the flood they had levels break a sorry poor badage they had weeks right outside here you think the Army Corp of Engineers would had them going right away stiffen up the ls they Kathy went to school at tan four times they brought up they tried to to fix the ls they defeat every they want to money waste money everybody did a very very poor job each time they fixed they didn't do anything they she was there from 80 to 84 and four times people are like we have to do this they're below SE and I I'm inv the nfip this is suit going on right now Jeffrey get directors I'll be able to you know it's amazing that storm comes in fale R check with billions I mean I'm talking billions but how about giving these cities you know what I'm saying the money beforehand whatever the million the thing is it's hard to get people buy into it they could a [Music] littley right but those those bills they try to pass all fail damage from the hurricane way worse there failed well after I can't not me any here do you have we're getting close yeah Kathy has a really good friend they two of them that went to school with and they grew up there and they never left they lost their home rebuilt they they have a new system of pump houses now guy it's all Andrew Jackson's fault won that battle maybe if they didn't build below sea level be in better shape too if they built where that things yeah trying to create new land is not the best option sometimes part of it would be okay to wash away my goodness there burin Street my goodness it's kind of ning when you're sitting door don't know's there yeah polican was here the yeah it's getting different we had that happen last year the biggest Bigg to get back inbody was so if you moved in now where are you oh glov that's nice you don't have to flood insurance over there CL you don't have to worry about pops no get so far though m not ching snow since we're waiting um can I get kind of an update on where we stand with uh anyone qualifying for the election the upcoming election have we had any new you're looking at him Frank Frank and Kim as well sh I did not see the letter I was out of town for a week and I don't I am my it was just ancing hey we have a presentation on the screen we made it right all right sorry about that guys so as Bill uh introduced himself um just a counterpart of Bill's I actually uh cover the western part of the United States so Colorado and West um but been nominated to do the presentations so that's why I'm here um but yeah we're uh I don't know I didn't wasn't listening super close to what he mentioned to to everyone but uh we are familyowned we're based right here in Florida out of Deerfield Beach you speak a little Clos yep we're based out of Deerfield Beach um started in 1926 as MWI uh we also own two other pump companies which is fpi and couch Pump Company couch actually started in 1917 so we've got a lot of history there um this is kind of just a quick picture of both of our facilities so at the top left is our plant Deerfield Beach it's even much larger than this picture shows here we actually take up about Three City Blocks we've got over 60,000 ft of manufacturing at that location and then on the top right is our Vero Beach facility uh difference between the two down in Deerfield is actually where we manufacture our submersible electric pump which is what we'll talk to you all about uh a little bit later here and then we also build our hydraulically driven pump called a hydro flow and a lot of other smaller pump uh items that you would use in the construction industry Vero Beach is all repair and then also a line Chef PP uh which is what he had mentioned a little bit earlier too it's where we really started out was line Chef pumps and agriculture um we are ISO 91 2015 certified um we've got pumps all over the world so that's kind of the purpose of this we're in over 50 countries uh worldwide uh one of the largest ones being over in uh Thailand and the Asia Pacific we've got over 250 pumps over there so um this is just kind of a list of the pumps we do manufacture so as I mentioned the hydro flow is the one on top there it's a hydraulically driven pump we're one of only two in the world that really build a pump like that um we got a mobile version of it and then what we're specialty really is is in the axelum mix flow which covers all three of our pump lines our line shaft our Hydro flow and and the submersible electric what axial flow is it's basically good up to about a 25 ft of head mixed flow is then going to take over after that and then we can get up to about 60 foot ahead so uh with that though you're able to move very large volumes of water as Bill mentioned earlier from about 1,000 gallons a minute up to over 400,000 gallons a minute so um this is just a quick snippet of a line shaft pump again where we started uh in in our uh journey of building pumps very simple you've got an electric motor or electric or diesel uh Drive Unit as you can see the three pictures here so one has a gear Head On Top there's a diesel engine and then a belt and po electric motor just wanted to show everyone that hey we do more than just one pump so uh won't spend any additional time there but we do manufacture them out of ASM a242 steel 304 stainless 316 stainless and we can cast them although we rather fabricate um talking about fabric ations uh the reason we prefer to fabricate out of plate steel is it's repairable and it's stronger cast iron cannot be repaired and it's about a third as strong as actual plate steel so um I left this in here this is also a line Chef station but the reason I left it is this is downtown Fort Lauderdale on the New River um you can see the highrises in the background there's some pretty big boats right there behind it's very very high inome area and they managed to put a pump station right down town and disguise it very well with nice murals on it and I mean again this is a line shaft so these are very large pumps but they made it fit into the area so it it can be done just depends on um you know what type of footprint you have but build this building is probably only what 50 by 50 or so it's probably 40 by 20 yeah yeah so um you can disguise the pump station and still make it work in the neighborhood so uh just a shot of our one of our manufacturing facilities this is in Deerfield Beach assembling a line shf pump so again we manufacture everything in house everything's made in the USA right here in Florida and then the purpose of these two slides so if you look at across the bottom where it says 20,000 gallons a minute and you go up the left where it's uh 10 ft of total dynamic head they intersect at the Red Dot right so we're pumping 20,000 gallons a minute at 10 ft of head at 504 RPMs by simplying manufacturing a different propeller same pump speed 504 RPMs but now it can be up to 16t ahe all we're changing is a propeller so on all of our pumps the hydroflow line Shaft or the submersible electric that intake and Bol assembly is the same unit it is just bolted depending on what the driving unit is after that can I ask you to explain what head is head is a it's a total calculation of all of the losses in your system so um it's going to be from the pipe you know if you have a concrete pipe or a uh PVC pipe there's losses there because the concrete is more uh porous it's also accounting for bends in any pipe or um anything that's flowing through so it accounts for those losses because that water has to make a turn it slows it down um it accounts for Lift so if your water level is here and we've got to lift it up 10 ft you have a static lift of additional 10 ft so you're adding all those losses together to get a total dynamic head okay does that make sense yeah okay so this kind of gets us into why we're really here um this is our one of our sub meral electric pumps uh as you can see we build them from 8 in to 60 in in diameter probably for your neighborhood you're looking one of our uh either the 8 10 or 12 in would probably be what you'd be looking at and of course as Bill also mentioned usually you want to have at least two one is a backup or redundancy if you've got one out being maintained or repaired something get stuck in in one of them and it overloads you're going to have to have the other one to still pump so you usually want that redundancy of at least an extra one backing it up how often does that have depends on what you've got in the streets going into them the breaking down scenario is very rare um it's usually something can get stuck in them depending on what type of trash rack system you have getting that water before he what what diameter of discharge now pumps take without a block it depend on the size of the pump so something smaller like the 8 to 12 like a 10 in um it'll go up to a 3 to 4 in compressible solid it'll snap a like a broom handle or something yeah bust that right off but if you get you know somebody's chunk of firewood that ends up floating down and getting pulled up and that you know but what it generally will do in a submersible electric it'll over amp and just shut it off um it's not as common for them to to you know detonate inside because there's not this big long shaft going up to a motor that's 20 feet away it'll usually over ramp the motor trip a breaker and shut it down first I'm just saying that because our new grates have about an inch and 3/4 opening okay doesn't mean things don't get in there and the old the old ones have maybe a 6 in yeah yeah and uh we also we can put a bar screen on the bottom too and size that the same and that will account for you know flow coming in so hey if we need to to ramp it up to get past you know say half inch openings we can do that I think the biggest problem you'll see here is Palm FRS and pine bark it'll eat them up yeah they'll get shot back up so the reason we you know again that you're interested in the submers electrics and they're becoming very popular especially in densely uh populated areas is if you look at this bottom right picture that's just a guy and it's a backo putting this pump in and out you don't need a giant crane you don't need heavy massive equipment and the pump station can be out of sight out of mind you can actually see the concrete walls around that there would be a grate that goes over the top and you would never even know that station's there so it's a it's a that's the uh intriguing or the Allure of it especially as we're running out of land in our coastal regions um so cost for the structure is very minimal uh there's no massive protective Coatings and housings around them needed um like I said you can pull it out your pump's probably going to weigh less than 1,000 lb you pull out with very small equipment at that point um less moving Parts also so it's everything is much more condensed down um and then of course as Bill had mentioned too we can make it out of multiple types of materials anywhere along the coast we highly would recommend 316 stainless steel it's going to hold up a lot better uh we won't get into the nitty-gritty of this but the the reason for this to is to show the breakdown of the pump but more so those are the same pumps side by side the pump on the left has a planetary gear in it so when you get to a large pump you got to slow that propeller down it can't spin at 12200 RPMs well when you have to slow an electric motor down the windings get massive so then it starts taking up all of the room you have to send your water through so we'll use a planetary gear to slow that propeller down even more to two or 300 RPMs so we can adapt and overcome we again we manufacture them all so we can build a pump for your station you don't have to build a station around your pump if that makes sense um yes U could you maybe start with a somewhat of an overview as far as what do these pumps do they're pumping to accomplish what where are they in a general system and um what if anything you know about our particular needs yep you're actually going to see that in about one or two slides we've got several examples of pump stations um and and even some Blueprints and drawings to show you uh right thank you no problem and the only thing I just want to touch on this slide before moving on we can install our pumps in three different positions we can install them horizontally we can put them on an angle or vertical all of our competitors only go vertical of course when you can put an angle or light on it side you can make that station even smaller and get it hidden out of the way where it's not in someone's backyard and sticking up in the air so uh another advantage to our product all of our parts are off the shelf shelf Parts if you end up needing a seal or you need a bearing or you need something for that pump you can go to a warehouse over here get the parts and have it repaired uh several competitors that of ours they make their own proprietary seal their own proprietary bearing that means they control the price they control how fast you can get it or even if you can get it we're not a parts company we're a pump company we rather you get your pump fixed and get it back going again with common off the shelves uh Parts this is an example of the installation so you can see the top Center is angled bottom left is a horizontal configuration and then a couple vertical cans there with uh some additional intake items to it this is an example down in Key West uh so again I don't know how many of you have been down to the Keys there's not a lot of real estate there so this entire pump the can that it's slid down in and it's discharge is all underground and down there what they're using is they're using injection Wells and injecting that back down into the Earth let that filter it and now you're not trying to put that water somewhere else when you don't have a place for it I have a question is the motor uh submersible also everything is in the water everything is in the water yep and with our um submersible electrics we manufacture our motor housing so the the actual Ro motor core we do purchase from the outside but we manufacture the housing or the Stater assembly around it and every single one of them is 304 stainless or 316 we do nothing less doesn't matter what the rest of the pump is made of um this is just a large station up in New York City again just showing the size that we can adapt to I won't spend a lot of time there cuz it doesn't fit your application this next two slides is what I really want to stay on so this is in Lake Park which is just North of West Palm Beach you can see the condos you can see the population around it and they actually fit this into a park so starting at the bottom right where they see that fence line that is where it's discharging out into the inter Coastal moving to the center picture is the flat Gates where it discharges from the pump so it comes out of those flat Gates runs down that drainage drainage dish there and off into the inter Coastal very very simple design and the entire pump station is that white concrete box that you see in that middle picture that's it what's the discharge diameter uh so one of them is a a 12 in the other two are 18 in how many gallons we just went over it what were they yeah I think uh like 12,000 gallons a minute 4500 is the small one 9,000 is the 18 okay so um again we wanted to really showed this because of it fitting into know the reason I asked that because I sent you some measurements okay and a typical street with 2 and 1/2 ft of water will hold about 50,000 gallons yep so you just said 12,000 gallons a minute doesn't take a lot of and there's going to be questions about coming over the seaw wall okay that would discharge pretty quick mhm yep yeah we were looking at the curves um a 10 in would do about 2 to 2500 gallons a minute so two of those one is a backup you know and the other thing you can do not necessar just a backup you can alternate their run times so you so when the one comes on this one will run that and then there the motor control center knows hey next time they've got to turn on turn this one on yeah know then you're not running 10,000 hours on one pump the other has two and it's also not sitting there not getting exercised so um these are the blueprints for that station so this is the bird's eyee view looking down and you can probably see it better on your computer screen that pump station is 19 ft and I can't see behind the other one uh by about 17 ft that's that entire vault in the ground with three pumps in it and it has a 72in uh feed pipe coming in which of course is going to be way overkill for what's needed 72 in 72 in Fe pip coming in yeah um that's taking a lot of area and we're funneling it all onto this one station that's why it's so large and the other thing I mentioned is connecting maybe four streets into one catch Basin which you're talking now 200,000 gallons but that 200,000 gallons wouldn't be there if they were pumping correct correct yep and if you have more than one pump in there you can also have a lead in a ltic so you could have that SEC if the water keeps coming up coming up that other one will then kick on and they'll you know work in unison at the same time and pump out and that's again looking at this station if if you can keep it as simple like this then you're not pumping against each other out one pipe they're their own separate TDH or own separate head um sometimes they they want to join them together into one pipe well then you're raising your head which adds horsepower adds pump sizes this is this is a really what we were feeling is a very nice fit probably for your area um and you can see here two where the three pumps sit pump one two and three it's like 10 ft of pipe and then there's discharges so this is also another one we wanted to share so this is in you can see a brand new construction neighborhood this is in a horizontal design so those pumps the intakes are here they come up into the pump and discharge out that way when this pump station's complete there's there's a cover that goes over the top of it they cover it up you don't even know it's there you have no clue that there's a pump station in the backyard of that neighborhood pump away that's four 24in pumps so another option with the horizontals if you can't go deep or you can't hey lay them on their side and then have it discharge out that'll keep your profile down a lot so when you say they're covered up I'm going to assume to the right of the pump is covered with ground cover corre left of is it an open grate and what kind of noise do these uh they'll be about as loud as your dishwasher so they're very very quiet so you didn't answer my first question is it an open gr uh it you could do both so this one actually has a concrete cover that goes over it because they're covering with Earth a lot of times they do like to put a grape over them let water pour down in and and go into that well that way too so if we put a a concrete cover over it and cover it with Earth how hard is that to uncover if there's a failure in back up I mean someone's going to have to dig it back out back up to the the the like yeah they have they have open grate on top of their their station on the rais area yeah over where the the pumps actually are it's just flat and they have they have hatch covers that they lift the hatch cover up and that exposes the pump so they can get the pump in and out if you have such a small if it's just such a small area why would you be putting Earth on top of a some it's that's what they we don't design the pump stations that's left up to the engineer so yeah that one looks large yeah that was a so you talked about how much they weigh what for each of the ones we're talking about for us can give me aart about how tall and wide these things are it's hard to tell on these pictures unless there's some yeah so so so I can we just did a pump test the one for Q that was an 18in pump and that stood about this tall so that was the whole thing the West is that located uh that one's going to Roosevelt Roosevelt just kind of trying to landscape I don't know cross street U we can send you the list we so we've got five of them down there right now that's number six we can send you a list of all of them yeah and what kind of time for me to put them in yeah that would be nice to know yep uh um we just we just worked on a job that uh has two 8 in I think they're th gallon a minute pumps and we have a we have a footprint of what that pump station looks like and we can get not here we can s it to yeah we can get that to you um and that might do you knowx do you know approximately the dimensions of that footprint is it like 8 by8 or 8 by8 is is more than what it is I I think it's it's actually less than that I think 8 by8 and uh then the depth is going to be uh Guided by your low water level um and the way you feed it some of them are fed open Channels with a trash grate this one is fed with a big pipe you know so all your street drains are draining into this one big pipe that's coming into the pump station just so people if they're listening on the Internet or whatever what your station would be would be smaller than our sandbagging station that we have keeping our sand in right now I think that's 10 by 10 yeah cuz like I said this one with three larger pumps in it is only 16 by1 19 so take two 10in pumps s it suck it down and yeah significantly smaller now advantage to that larger well though is you can use that as storage so as stuff comes in it can also count for storage for you too you're putting them pumps under ground do the KN air the the cooling or anything like that the water is what's cooling up okay yeah so that pump slides down in a can and that is where all that water is being discharged through so it's rushing over the motor and the entire pump assembly that's what keeps it cool no air flow needed that's we got there that's it um this just another example of a horizontal design so what they what they did in this wet well of course you can see it's much larger but flange slides down in a c channel so they can take that entire pump and intake assembly slide it down in and it pumps when they don't need it they pull it back out go put it in storage it's not laying down there in the water these are actually used around Lake Oobi so it's only used in drought times but again just another customized design that we do um this was one of the ones that bill was talking about Hilton Head so what you can see on the concrete walls is Barnacles Barnacles only grow in salt water so just an example again of a horizontal very low profile design to get the water pumped out to where it needs to go and this can kind of this is a again our design of of how to hang this pump so what you'll see is that pump comes down and the the Armature goes over the back of that picture to the right and the actual weight of the pump is all that seals it in there it doesn't have to be bolted in you don't need a diver to go down to bolt it or unbolt it it's Dro down in with a a crane or a lift truck and pulled back out the same way and that's just a picture of it being uh complet it's a again completely same as steel that's a 30in pump but you know just depends on how much room you have and what works for you guys but again we can we build our stuff to this the engineer that's designed the station they don't have to do it around our pump so another angle design so this is a Colorado I won't spend much time on it but again proprietary to us so they use big old gravel beds use it for storing water because there's shortages out there so they slide this down in pumps it up the pipe and shoots to the next pump retention Pond and there's just a example of another stainless steel pump so this is a 18in pump so this where shy stands about a little taller than I do um quick thing behind the stainless steel this is in a waste treatment plant which we normally don't get into however our competitors pumps were cast iron and they were being destroyed in about 3 to four years this pump I personally took this picture in May in September this pump was 5 years and it that's what it looks like it was brand new like it came off of our manufacturing facility floor so this 316 stainless is really the way to go for lenity not 304 I always take 3166 is a finished product you know with 304 308 you don't ever you can do the 304 the 316 is harder so it you know if you've got a lot of sand in in your water stuff it's going to hold up to that abrasiveness rushing through at all times um that's really it on the submersible electrics uh the last couple slides is just other pumps that we do rent and the only reason I left it in there is if you guys ever run into a situation where hey you need pumps over here an emergency we have them in Tamp we have a branch right there that rents so those we have four up to 12 in you know those are going to be the diesel pumps sitting on a trailer but they could be used if you have a lift station that goes out for sewage you got a drain that's just totally not draining and you got to pump it somewhere we do have them close by so just if if that would ever come up your discharge pipes are they what what type of Steel 836 Core 10 we can make them out of core 10 we can make them out of stainless we we roll our own okay oh you yeah we can also buy a stainless pipe too you if you end up needing usually we'll roll them up to about 20 ft long so over 40 to 60 ft go by the pipe instead of us making it but everything again is done in-house we roll our around weld it put a fles on it so the suggestion for your station would be to complete stainless steel everything so stainless steel flap Gates uh stainless steel pipe stainless steel pump everything it last very very long as he said 24 years and Hilton Head just now starting to replace them we're doing some jobs down in South Florida on some golf courses and they're using this HTP pipe which is a plastic and and it's expensive I think but uh they're never going to replace it ever it's always going to be is more expensive than stus no it's not more expensive than stains but it's an expensive pipe it's not like PVC PVC used to be so inexpensive um but the HTP and if you don't have far runs PVC is still used a lot yeah I mean c 10 will last it looks like crap I mean you know but it lasts for right and we can also you know if this say it's a station similar to this we can coat the stuff in like a bona coating so that hey if you don't want to see that stainless look we can make it black white green gray pink purple doesn't matter we can coat it in that um in our longer presentation we actually do have a smers electric the pump assembly that was coded in a white bzona it was in a reservoir it was there for 10 years they pulled it out it was as white as a sheet of paper so that can be done too if it's you know for aesthetic reasons but you really don't need to cope the stainless so so I my assumption is that youve had conversation with our engineer yeah brief conversation like I said we haven't been in your site we don't know how your site is set up there was a question earlier what what do we do what are we pumping uh in this case we're pumping storm water and uh storm water um it's great when it's gravity until the body of water that you're dumping into is higher and and then it won't flow that's where our pumps can be so um most of most of our work is done with Engineers they've come up with conceptual designs and ask us to look do we have a product that will work where they need it and we go back and forth with them we Supply them information on Footprints um they work with the customer and find out where that footprint is is it to big is it manageable and we just work back and forth and and uh we're into the pump side but uh and that's what we do we we understand how much horsep we need with how much flow but usually the engineers are the ones that are coming up with the flow rate it's not us now do you uh whenever you uh are specking out a pump is does that specification does that come from the engineer or does the engineer come to you and say this is my problem what size pump do I need both both we have we have lots of different specifications depending on the materials the type of pump it is the type of motor it's going to be the RPM and we Supply that to the engineer um sometimes they open it up and add different materials uh that they think are more suited but but yeah we generate a specification on the pump that we think is matching what he's trying to design and what the customer needs something to keep in mind too um and your engineer will help with it but you'll want to know what type of service you have at your location from FPL uh sometimes they don't have enough ampage to run 460 volt electric motors so it's another thing you want to look into and understand what is there and and can it run these motors um some of them are very low amperage but it it just depends on what the load is in that area so that's an FPL question but you'll definitely want to look into that and I think no matter where this is decided this goes and that'll be a decision I guess with the um that the um engineer will make we're going to have to bring in power whatever wherever it goes that we have we have nothing okay you know no nothing ready for this and I don't even know where you would propose to put it you have a pump station at Seventh Street I'm not sure what the Poli the that's be on ours though that belongs to the county yeah but he's talking about bringing in the power Just power just the power yeah yeah the power I me we just will have to it'll come in yeah just like I said food for food for thought when you're thinking about placement and hey make sure you can get large enough service there yeah a lot of this stuff is done in phases like your other projects your sidewalks or everything else you don't come in and put them everywhere you start off with a plan and you know you work your way through you start off with a storm plan maybe you're working on drainage uh maybe you put in a a a sump and maybe you put in one pump and a few years later you come back and put the second pump in um you know there's a there's a shoe size for everybody and uh I think one of the advantages that we have is we're a small company and we can work through 15 different phases or we can come in and do all 15 phases of no it's great you guys are local as far as I'm concerned you know we're not looking at a pump made in China I'm very pleased with that not at all yeah um and and also I this is not something that I'm getting into but um I know with some types of federal funding they want to use what's called build America buy America we fall very nicely into that which we've been told by municipalities can get them more money because of being able to use products for that they're Built America by America so just another thing to keep in mind that's all have you found a lot of Grants uh or I know you guys don't get into the grants or whatever but have you seen we haven't but we've gotten involved in a lot of projects in the last few years that are Grant funded yeah that's yeah so where they get the grant how they do it I don't know right but but I'm just saying that you know there's grants available that yes yeah the I'll screw up the abbreviation but I think it's a American Recovery um we see a lot of that stuff coming through um you know in the spec that that's part of the funding so that therefore you've got to do this this and this to make sure that everything you're using meets it but there's a lot there's some money out there from that I know I know after flooding FEMA comes in um some people go after FEMA money it might take longer to get but that's available being in Florida what we're familiar with with the hurricanes and the flooding you know that money becomes available again I don't know how search it find it if you can help me understand the power source in that if there is flooding it seems to me the power can go out which it often does during a hurricane so what good are the pumps then if it's an electric Source pump so a lot of times they'll in in the engineer will also put a gen set or a generator in a enclosure off to the side that would indeed kick on then and be able to run the pumps for x amount of time as long as you have a fuel source and those can be diesel or natural gas also but that's your backup power option the the station that's on the screen now they have their motor control center which is on the left side in that picture right there there's actually a generator plug so the town has a generator that they keep stored somewhere and if they lose power or if they're having a storm come they can pull it out there there's enough concrete they park it there and plug it in that's their backup power but that's a good point sometimes you can go to a lot of uh lengths to get a good Pump Station and if you lose your power source you lose it some areas uh FPL will tell you what grid you're on and depending on what kind of storm you have that this area is going to be the first area back up um and running that's the areas that they they look at first um some of them are water treatment plants sewage treatment plants whatever grid those on sometimes you're close enough to one of those to tie into that and after catastrophe that's the first one that's going to come back up and run do you have an idea how many pumps we need no have you ever done a project where uh a well was built uh in line with an existing drainage system uh we have pipe we have check valves and we have drains and um rather than reconstructing the entire city have you done projects where there was a small well built and then you had another pipe that ran out to the the seaw wall um I can catch pacing first and know yes yeah we've been involved in this it seems like that would be the least invasive to to do smaller Wells and smaller Motors MH yes and sometimes that's easier on your power grid as well instead of trying to get 200 amps to run you know 300 horsepower engine you're just trying to get no more than what a house would use to that spot okay so you said that the pump that you thought we would use weigh about a th000 pounds so you must have something in mind or what you think we need well based on the rough calculations that Frank did he was getting close to about a 2,000 gallons a minute flow to be able to bring the Streets back down in say 30 minutes um but that and by using that number we use our pump curves and we can determine what size pump it would be and what horsepower from our curvs point of information I gave you the worst scenario okay where if the pump was active they like the water just started to come in 2 and 1 half ft like it started coming I just use the last St started coming in the street around 12:00 by 1:00 it was breaking the street by 3:00 it was in people's yards okay but my thing is 3:00 it breached the seaw wall that would have at two feet 2 and 1/2 ft of water and I'm probably being very conservative wouldn't have been there when it breached the seaw wall so water coming over the sea wall would have been able to be be pumped out again because it would it I'm not saying water would not get in the street but it would be minimal and it won't be in the homes yeah yeah and you can also so you put transducers in that wet well that will bring that pump up slowly so it might only turn it on at 500 RPMs and then as that level starts Rising it spins it up faster faster faster and then take maybe brings on number two but it could run at a very slow speed to maintain that flow and maybe even maybe it doesn't have to go to full speed that point because it's ahead of the game right and at 2:00 or not 4:00 we reached a 2.0 high tide okay was coming down like I said said that water still stayed in the street for four more hours and I'm talking about see here's the other problem we have a we have a population here that's and it's upper 50s the average so I have 2 and A2 ft of water in the street how do I get an ambulance down that street it's having a heart attack how do I get a fire truck Mr Banker that's not his problem no no I'm just put I'm putting it out I'm to have a heart attack don't I think what we we looked at was have you know 8 to 10 in pump uh 7 to 10 to 15 horsepower motor uh but that changes with the the amount of flow you need and using a vfd like Kelby mentioned you can regulate your speed so um you turn a light switch on it's on or off if you have a Demmer you can that's what a BFD does so it slows it down and it can keep up with your flow that's good because I mean I don't see although we do get some flooding in some areas it's doesn't remain in the street very long you know it moves with the tide so whatever that tide flow is is about what our water flows off the streets yeah so we don't you know there's a few times a year a few tides that we have an issue you know it's not every day it's not a Key West issue it's a lot different than that so um so I think we just need to be mindful of that my point and saying all that is this pump that you're envisioning that will remove 2,000 gallons per minute what's the price tag for something like that just for the pump I know we're not talking about building a vault and the construction and dropping it in and connecting all the pipes and what have you it's Christmas time too I want to remind you there's two of them but not stay on straight like a recent project maybe would be yeah of I'm I'm going to throw a number out a couple hundred th000 M okay and U and then we still have to construct The Vault construct all the pipe connectors and and you know we on the way over you can't imagine how busy are and how many jobs we we were talking we were talking Illinois DNR two different jobs one's a 48 inch bump and uh two of them are twelves yeah and I don't think the pump so we're we're all over the place on our size that we manufacture so it's hard to come up with pricing um we just sold two 8 in pumps this week similar to what we kind of Envision might work for you all and I don't remember what they were so yeah because every job is different but they were stainless two are the same but they were very they're very simple so would you say roughly the price of the pump is about a third of the cost of the entire project I don't know on that's all going to be based on how much infrastructure you have to alter yeah we don't get involved in that a lot of a lot of customers will buy the equipment direct from us and then they go out for bid with the construction right um and and the Civil is where it gets expensive yeah so if you can keep that simple like a pre-cast station that drops right in and then put the of course you're saving a bunch of money and that's probably what you'll have here you'll have something small that that pre-cast people can bid on so you don't have crews out there trying to form it they're going to bring something that's going to be installed yeah I've done enough of those onite we have a station right now but it's does it have a pump is that what what is it that we have I thought I heard nothing that's for County sewage okay but we got power running to it we got like a 24 in pipe on sth street that runs directly through the park and if you could drop in something in line with that pipe would probably be the best option so some thing that you were all talking about and Bill mentioned too um if there is a well of some sort a a box a cob box or something cast there there are other pumps that we manufacture so there's one that's a it's a hydraulically driven pump and it can still be run by an electric motor so that pump could be dropped down in there the Drive Unit is like he said on a trailer off to the side and it could be dropped in for a storm event pulled out put on the trailer and hauled away if something like that worked they they've done that a lot down in some of the small South Florida towns that don't have the money for a big that wouldn't be practical for us it really would okay St we don't we don't have that type of Manpower well that's another thing that a lot of people run into they don't have Louisiana has a lot of people working on their pump stations and they'll have you know one municipality might have 20 drive units that they're pulling out getting hooked up for storms but that's a Manpower okay well we've got some uh interesting information to consider and uh I think probably the next step is just to go back to the engineers and and see if this is something that's doable and what what are we talking about pricewise yeah it's very interesting to see you know if we can make it work well we we appreciate your time and letting us come and present our product to you and again we're we live just across the state and we're local we consider this locals if you have any questions want to go make a site visit and look at what you have with the engineer we're more than open for any of that is this your second visit here it is that's what I thought I appreciate you coming back yeah well our first visit we weren't on the agenda or anything that's right and um working with municipalities you you know we didn't want to spoil anything we we we don't we only want to come if we got something to talk about I can tell you that I think we have something to talk that we're not a unique situation on San Key island um you can go right next door to Indian Rocks Beach they're having the same problem yeah keep just going right on Down the Line everyone is having flooding issues so uh there's potential for other business yeah we had king tide this year that lasted longer than anybody remembers higher than anybody remembers and we had a lot of neighborhoods on the East Coast that stayed you know their swes were full of water for a long time then we had fish in our SES um we hadn't seen that in unless we had a storm but we hadn't seen that within king tide ever in my life that I remember definitely been an interesting year yeah well thank you I appreciate apprciate you coming he would and he he's a pretty easy going guy he would have left you go on our remember when here they left already you're going to bring them up oh yeah do you have um any material leave behind for those of us that don't have anything that maybe Kyle can put in our mailboxes or something EV business contact yeah we've got some we've got some stuff to vice mayor Shirley well I guess this is the last time I'll call you this but um just take a look at it and then give it back to Kyle and if you need more we can mail them over too yeah okay yeah that's not a card you got a card okay thank you council member Elliot did you have any more uh questions some only the question I had was that um are they still there I'm yes they are um you you're likely aware that we are already uh in the midst of a major storm water uh uh Improvement project right now and so what is the differential in cost in terms of in progress with the new effort going on versus having to do it later or coming back how does that inrease the cost I we can't speak to it we we don't know what you're involved in now or what what you have to do to put in a pump like we manufacturer so I don't think we can speak to that unfortunately um because we have we have streets that haven't been touched yet at all and we'll be going through um you know regrading the streets putting in all the storm sewers you know of the whole project um so is it is it easier to do your work uh when that's going on and and the streets are open I mean you know the construction is going on and pipes are exposed or is it just a clamp on thing that it doesn't make any difference it comes it can come later yeah well ideally you'd like to do it all at the same time if you have the budget and you have the people that can do the work um ideally you just want to make sure that if you decide to put in a pump station wherever you put it um that's your allowing for that in in your infrastructure that you're installing your piping is the right size you have some gravity drain you know drains that are the right size you may end up having to put some check valves in some systems so you don't get back flow um but um it's easy we're working on some projects we're very busy but some of our projects are 15 phases and they're just working on the swes right now they have haven't even gone back in and started making changes in all the culs that are under people's driveways so there it depends on you know where you are and what you're trying to accomplish but uh you know I can suggest and you probably are already doing it your master plan for your your flood is work through before anything else is done you know what your your end results going to be so everything you do preliminary secondary all ties in with the getting it to a pump station or adding whatever you're going to do right and final question is approximately how long is your uh bidding process so that if you if if we asked you to participate in this how long does it take you to get a proposal together we we bid jobs in 48 hours right now what our our problem is is our deliveries are along and we're running you know maybe a 36 to 40 we delivery on some pumps right now and that hasn't been we're not accustomed to that neither our Town's people are Engineers we've gotten accustomed to it but it's still that's a a long leap time but as far as putting a a proposal together in bid that's that doesn't take much time if you're 36 weeks out mhm wouldn't that say uh lot of communities are trying to resolve their flooding issues that's why when he mentioned her a lot of municipalities are purchasing from us so they don't have to wait for a bid to come out so they give a yeah they give a PO we start building and then you put the job to bid 6 months down the they're still working on the pump station design that's going to go around our pumps while we're getting started on the pumps still have time to construct that or design that and then go out for bid and when the contractor finally gets there he'll have pumps to put in so but some some folks can't do that some folks can't buy direct they have to excuse buy it through a contractor and you know all right uh if there are no other questions I'd like to thank Mr Morgan and Mr Miller for coming out I'm going to gra gra some brochures out of the car and bring you and um the next time you come back we'll we'll have something better for you to connect to all right that's all right that work out thank you thank you all right see as that is the only item on the agenda um would anyone like to make a motion to aurn motion made by Frank bers do I have a second second second all right Christmas everybody I'll split it with you too all right all in favor I any opposed we"
