as far as the weeds and brush we're getting that pretty much taken care of one thing that I'm very proud to say we've had an issue at the corner here at uh Causeway and Gulf Boulevard and I spoke to the homeowner and as of today they started repainting their house so they're uh I spoke to them Friday and they said they were going to try to get something done in the next two weeks but I was very good pain today when I showed up this afternoon other than that everything else is pretty much status quo we still have probably about four cases right now that I'm working on for an unlicensed contractors and unpermitted stuff got through more today but again they're they're going to be in compliance so but other than that if anybody has any questions cancel it yesterday Harrison Avenue the doc repair foreign [Music] [Music] right and above the top song that's those are things that even removed not necessarily without prepared what what is our position number well I didn't know about the boat is the boat still there is it sunk in the water because I don't know anything about that I know our reviewed it pulled it out um and it was supposed to be removed by Cito so that's the last I heard about it and that was just before yeah it's tied it's still tied up and then the lid like I said was just hanging on a while you know when that lets go I don't know if it wasn't enough but chances are already I'll take a look at the old extra conditions because it's something that's called the break loose before they get an apartment because I bring you to learn any other questions thank you very much have a good evening okay happy New Year yeah same to you and uh I would also like to let you know that today is National Law Enforcement appreciation day and I just wanted you to know that we certainly appreciate you and we would appreciate and others if they were here I showed up and I will tell you that actually um it's funny you mentioned that tomorrow night I am going to the hockey game is the lightning has a law enforcement Appreciation Night and a gentleman by the name of Mike Honeycutt who owns Jed ICU out of Tampa has taken 14 of us to VA tomorrow evening so thank you okay if we do have a representative from the uh the sheriff's department we're going to come in and we'll just call the meeting get a report and then we'll get right back on track if that's okay with the council great all right now we are on to item four a presentation from from Sharon and belong right it was a public affairs specialist with the U.S small business administration uh welcome Miss uh and uh let's uh let's hear your presentation so I don't like to call everybody with like you know PowerPoints or anything like that so it's going to kind of give you a quick overview and then maybe go into a couple of examples so thank you so much for having me here Mr Mayor commissioner and definitely I'm Kyle over there and so um small business administration offers or our mission is to help homeowners renters non-profits and businesses of all sizes to prepare for respond to recover from and mid-8 against disasters of all types whether it's man-made or natural so I'm sure you guys are familiar with Ian and also Nicole but we're talking specifically about games Pinellas County was considered a primary County within the Ian SBA declaration and so we actually provide homeowners of low interest disaster loans for a physical property damage we also not includes you know they have a roof damage structural damage debris Landscaping fencing things like that also if there's any type of content inside the real estate structure itself that was damaged that would also be considered that's considered personal property we have a mitigation aspect to the physical property loan they would just need to ask like a loan officer or case manager or something like that it definitely would have to have a physical property loan now if you were if Bel Air rage was involved in another uh hurricane or another declaration from another storm within the last two years and then you know now they've gone to European they might want to consider calling their SBA a loan officer case manager back and request a mitigation aspect uh maybe they might want to do some kind of house raising retaining wall or something like that for consideration because Florida does suffer a lot of Damages here whether it's hurricanes or tornadoes Waters fast those kind of things um also I know that Bel Air mean doesn't have any businesses per se but sometimes they're solopreneurs serial openers that work from home and all types of businesses are eligible to apply for low interest disaster loans not just the physical so if their businesses maybe that work out of the home then more than likely they would be eligible for the physical property damage for their home versus maybe the business but that would be a question of course for the loan officer and the economic injury disaster loan is for instance if they were a salesperson that sold let's say advertising to the media or something like that and they worked out of their home a lot of people work hybrid now and I'm far from home then they need the eligible simply because maybe you know people are spending their money on pre-existing you know getting their homes back to pre-existing conditions and so maybe now they don't have the extra funds to spend on other things like advertising and things like that um we were talking with Kyle earlier about secondary homes now there might be a possibility that there might be some homes on Baylor Beach that might be a secondary home now those homes wouldn't be eligible for the physical property damage if it was damaged during Hurricane however if it was used as maybe rental income and that would be considered eligible does anyone have any immediate questions um I can tell you the interest rates if you're interested sure okay the interest rates are as low as 2.188 for homeowners and renters it's as low as 1.875 percent for non-profits and 3.04 for businesses and I like to kind of give an example of let's say a credit card example and so sometimes people are a do-it-yourselfer and so if they're kind of like that like right after Ian I know Pinellas County was without power at least 400 000 people that have power so it might look for spoil some kind of you know whether it's food or maybe you have some kind of so if we were to do it yourself or maybe you had some kind of damage roof damage or anything like that then um maybe it's possible that you are go to Lowe's or something like that and get all your supplies and maybe put all of your I don't know maybe it was 20 000 to fix a home just picking a number on this guy and you put it on a credit card well as we know credit card interest rates nowadays is 20 30 percent even pre-coded it's 10 maybe so let's say you had excellent credit pre-coded 10 on your credit card but you threw twenty thousand on there what happens if you don't make your payment on the 20 000 in first time and add that right so you can actually pay yourself back for all of the money that you put on your credit card for the supplies to fix your roof up to 60 inch TV that you want to watch our TV and okay so um you can pay yourself back with the low interest successful and for Homeowner renter is 2.188 versus maybe 10 on the credit card it's kind of an eight percent difference there any questions no thank you so much um I left my card there if you'd be uh kind of to just email me um is this able about um just email me and then I can communicate with you and if you have maybe I can send you some additional documentation yeah actually if you can I'll send the email to you and then what I'll do is I'll broadcast it out to a bunch of people it's like you know there's things we just don't know and we'll be awesome thank you and um commissioner Roberts yes I was just going to ask I don't have any particular issues at this time but may uh something that's already answered what's going to be the best way to get in contact with you so I actually loved every single one of you one of my business cards and it would be so kind um commissioner Roberts is to email me I will be happy to send you over some documents and if you need some additional documents even if it's not related to you know like hurricane Nicole for instance you had somebody you know I can always communicate with you that way as well so just send me an email if you need to call me you can call me on my cell that's totally fine thank you so much any other questions [Music] thank you very much thank you mayor all right we're going to item five which is quarterly board reports first off could we have a report from the board of adjustments definitely please [Music] Mr Mayor Templeton Mike Kelly for judgment chairman good timing um yes we had a meeting this quarter yes we had an interesting hearing and with the help of Randy and with the help of Kyle you know Patty we handled an administrative appeal something that board of Justice normally doesn't end but we did this time and Randy thank you very much for being so cautious as to how we handle it and Kyle thank you for bringing forward to this of the report by that planner because that definitely helped our case so it wasn't a normal variance we had one coming up on Thursday but it was administrative appeal any questions do you have a you have another one coming out and you said That's Thursday this Thursday is a regular marriage for health he had a house on the 22nd that's under construction Council yes are the limits for these carries the tourism on the City website our Real Estate website not sure I know some of our members have attended um you know by um you know a couple of have been out of town but they did yesterday but I don't know that's on the website is there a website now we can put it up okay I'll check to make sure it is okay thank you yeah the one we have Kyle made an administrative decision that the particular homeowner didn't agree with so our board was asked to to represent the city and make a judgment and with Randy soap that's exactly what we did thanks for being here now are you saying that the board of adjustment meetings are not being posted on the website they should be they should be there the question was specifically for one of the minutes were on the website okay it wasn't clear decided that the minutes have been approved a subsequently yeah so there's also that that was our first meeting of the first meeting since the beginning of the journal speaking about [Music] thank you very much Mr Kelly yes sir next up is the citizens advisory committee [Music] thank you mayor Ron saganix is the assistant advisory Council chair we didn't have a meeting in this past quarter we're going to continue to work on the project when we talked about last quarter which is um working with the city manager of assembly called a variety of capital projects in the stormwater projects and we're working with uh on Council and lenders to get some potential quotes in the near term that for you all to just be scientifically something would work well that's it yeah one question what's the market look like these days [Music] probably just right for 15 years is around four and a half percent and so it's a new achievement of the existing bond that we have and we have three years remaining on the good news is to take your traders long over the last two days so that's the rate prior to that so hopefully the tenure keeps falling down and we decided school we want to do then it'll be a good time and that is a tax exemplary thank you very much Mr Chicken next up uh Park and Recreation board good evening everyone Tammy will end up Park and record chair so we had a very busy um fourth quarter m1d I'd like to thank all the volunteers that helped we had a very nice Halloween event our first annual chili cook-off went

to see all there we have a lot of really good health and wellness care providers that are attending this year think that's everything does anybody have any questions for me just quick note I bought two of those towels for full intent to use those in my swim practices and they were relinquished over and this is a good idea use them in your guest bathroom so we got two nice lows you know Miller Beach shell type things in the guest bathroom there okay very nice we do still have some hand towels that are exactly like this like speaking of guest bathroom religious we've had those for a little bit we don't have a lot of them left but we do still have some in stock oh and just one more quick note we will no longer be doing the t-shirts because we had a very difficult time trying to

attorney as we enter the legislative session we our office tends to monitor that session very closely we're already looking at what's getting filed before it gets into the committee and start seeing where our new forms of preemption will come from our new unfunded mandates and the sorts of things that may change either your powers or what we do in this community and so as that happens we'll try to keep you updated I will try my report to keep you updated of the ordinances not that just affect local government but that may affect local government as it relates to your community if any of you

that I'm tracking those are meeting any expectations you have in that regard otherwise Happy to answer any questions thank you thank you very much see the manager's report Mr reefer Europe thank you so uh started off with our 12th and 13th day Street stormwater project we're getting very close to wrapping that up um Nancy before the holiday um and click the paving I think they did a nice job on it after the New Year on January 5th we did a walk through where we created a punch list for which any other things we saw that need to be corrected on the project some of those things were some basic cleanup some of it was we spot some high high points in the uh Valley curb where they're gonna have to restructure each other trades properly and fortunately the neighbor out there was not it just had rain before so it kind of really showed where the drainage should be adjusted um they've submitted their last pay app the engineer and I are reviewing it we have some took intentions on the quantities so we're coming in the back and forth to get our measurement sources there so at this point we they're claiming that the paver restoration came out even higher than our uh our as needed amount that's all we have a contract we want to make sure that the measurements are correct and then the other thing was the uh the required base 8 inch base of crushed concrete but based on what the engineer measured for excavation we think we're gonna we're gonna come down on what they claimed to refuse for that quality so um once we have that all wrapped up it looks right right now with their submitted to pay up for is uh they're over our total contract of about 26 000. um I'm expected to come down some but unless that's finalized speed do a budget adjustment [Music] make sure they're accurate the uh after they finish that um we televised the segments that go from the inlets to the Sea walls at 12-13 um I have those I want to share those videos with you guys I sent them to the engineering Engineers recommending that we do so kind of here in place liner to seal off the Integrity of those pipes they're not failing right now but they're they're on their way and we did the last thing will August are something to kind of fall in after we just replace the bunch of pipe in the system so I'm working on getting proposals for those for those segments so they can present them to show you the options we have while we're out there um cleaning the pipes on 12th Street Saturday we discovered that the check valve was not functioning properly I was out there with one of my staff members and we removed it I contacted manufacturer and they are going to replace it out because it kind of worked in a way that I've never seen before they would never see it they're going to assess it and uh and give us an email so just be aware if we do get any comments on the tide rules rise and people are seeing that the waters infiltrating the system that there is no check valve on 12th Street at the moment 15 inches at least in-house but when do you participate having a replacement they're usually pretty quick I would I would imagine one or two weeks I should have it included in immediately it won't take very long we have it all cleaned out so it's just been pumping out on the water as well either fastened um so the undergraduate project that is uh it's continuing because the order of their supplies they expect the economy to come in within 30 days um once the material is in it'll be the only stock up at the marina and the utility underground underground consult affordable uh we'll begin installing enough we should start seeing actual progress shortly the Seawall and boat ramp project that is that is pretty much wrapped up we are still working out the final pay app the the city step after the last meeting we talked about in that wheel stop that it actually became more of a burden on the wrap we went out there rented some tools and removed that real stuff and then I got the contractor to come out to clear more of the set of network that was around the hell falls and they moved it where that drop-off existed so over time it's it's sloped off we want to still kind of make sure that it's settled the way we want it so that so that it will trailer can back up and not um foreign [Music] Landing they actually put in piling for support as opposed to the way they kind of used to doing everything off the larger dock so that should hold up better I left out a taught our upper pole that used to be on the old dock you can it could always be put back but one of the one of the complaints we're talking about residents about the old doctors they put up on the fact that they thought that space was limited for when they back with the trailer so that that upper pole was sort of approaching on the on the pathway of packing up so um if it becomes a problem I ordered some police that were going to put on the Lower Landing so it's a tie off but if we do notice that people are going to try to use the dock as some kind of Pivot Point and see how that works the city staff is still going to do the backfill so now that we have a doctor I have full scheduled to be dropped off Friday before use our equipment to start back footing and we're going to order the stock so that we can restore among those as the assistant's advisory chair told you that we're still investigating the the bond issue a blown for the stormwater projects that is our determining Factor as far as we're going to be at is Louis Farrell what's going on there so if we get the loan the idea is that we're gonna try to combine all those projects to get them done the alternative would be if we don't do the loan then we are going to move forward over 17 to 18th 19th 20th and tonight but either way we know it's a priorities so once we have that determined it will be designing and building [Music] projects are the code enforcement analysis he presented report in the old format this month but I'm working on next month on the quarter format some ideas that I've used in Resident feedback on I would like to incorporate a section that kind of shows more of the uh outstanding open violations that just tracks the matter whether it's uh something like a house that has been completed or a structure is not permitted it'll be more laid out so that some of those ongoing code enforcement residents and then another thing I wanted to do which I've been testing and playing around with an Excel spreadsheet but I want to tie in our different categories of code that we talk about in the survey so that I can lay it out in a pie chart to display Equitable recovery make it a little bit more visual the city hall generator last I would agree with suggesting that I reach out to cat so I contacted the cat with ring power they did not currently have a used you know natural gas generator they're still looking for once I can get a price on that currently we have to do all night a resident after that has been approached me with that an idea for his company was looking to auction off an existing generator in their head um right now it's still kind of on the table where I'm looking at the price for the install if we were to obtain that generator and the transportation price it's I just want to get the numbers because I want to explore the option for consideration it would be a much larger generator but we'd be getting it at a very good price just thought since it was out there but it's still an option I investigated to see just that we were talking about different options the buoy replacement I got some prices on that the follow-up I put the application in for the for the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and the fdep before the holidays I followed up after the holidays it kind of went on I ate this for a little bit they at least with the Army Corps it's been assigned and I will keep following but at the EP to make sure I have their approval because I need their approval to go back after receipt with their applications um I think we see is fully aware of steps that I can't use so that they're they don't open an appliance but uh pursuing permanent the 16 Louise I guess the prices in order to just to let you know we're looking at the 16 movies for our swim zone is going to cost roughly the uh about five thousand dollars and and that's what all the uh that's the movies only uh but when you do the install the uh the contractor will put together the anchoring system and the stainless steel Hardware the pricing on the install has gone up significantly since the last time they installed 16 movies it's uh almost doubled it's up to 20 000 800 it's a quote I got so I'm going to shop around I'm going to look at uh some other options with helicoid anchors and also I recently in contact with Clearwater Beach when we had the storm watch out some of their markers kind of talked to them about who they were using somewhere to try to reach out and see if there's any better pricing option uh I got the Morgan Park parking lot that's on the agenda we'll talk about that later you know it's the we're offering a CPR class our staff is due to be re-certified the CPR first aid that's going to be on January 19th at 7 30 a.m here that's open to the public instead of 30 minutes for the pppr certification I believe it's going to be 60 basically an additional money fifty dollars basically an additional thirty dollars for this for the first page and that will be uh put on by our local Suncoast fire department representative so um we'll also advertise that the RFQ uh we got all those submissions we've got six uh statements qualifications submitted the last week we had our our preliminary evaluation of where we've met we scored the six we have a really big order at this point the recommendation is that we follow up with all six firms looking at the January 18th of January 25th for interview time slots and I would like to bring in reference and adhere their you know quick presentations in and be able to ask them how they can teleport to our audience in the city and they'll be able to explore them up and I expect to have a recommendation for agreement by the next Council the mild position the community services administrator I'm down to two candidates and I'm planning on actually I have an old schedule this week to come back for a secondary kind of informal interview I'd like for them to uh meet the Public Works staff and be shown around the self-defart facilities and see some of our equipment just to get a feel from the staff great qualified candidates so we've been luck out got about five applied but that's a two quality units on another five and that was that was totally from posting in on our City website and uh using some really big contacts successfully yeah the uh we got the audit we just approved and they should be on site thank you for the very thorough details report that we greatly appreciate it counselor any questions Mr Roberts Kyle and I had a couple of conversations about this with the 12-13 screen project I think in the future I don't know if he addressed this in our conversation but the as needed area if we can kind of in future is that we put out there that we minimize that as an example for the removable and reinstall of the papers that we could have had that in the original bid so them with respect to what they've been in charge of this work what is where you are the measurement they use so that would be part of your original bed because if we all know any type of contract it gets an opportunity to come up with their own numbers is going to have a good one for us so yeah we could include that in there for them and as a recap what I think it was included in the original offenders included as as the United provide that price um but it would the way it was handled with the PO and the contract was not having it built into the PO it was said that the ad eating would come out of the contingency yeah so it was a bit on no no I did that but it would be um in our conversation you were saying that they they included it as an as needed so we didn't know what their unit price was going to be so we did we didn't know the unit could have a price on it against but we didn't know what the actual measurement was I think they could have actually defined that in a second firm it could have taken the time to Define areas of those of those existed and and if something was added from a homeowner once the bids went out again that unit price was fine but I think we would do a better job of tighten that up so that later and we're in the situation we are in now but we're saying that why she gave us a few times doing we continue kind of time that would be it would be a good thing okay um on the generator so I know you mentioned this earlier that it can't had some that was diesel again one of the places that came from before we had multiple generators out there for each building and we did have uh diesel tanks so typically you know obviously based on the size of the diesel tank so walk away because we could use Diesel and we can have a contract with a diesel provider that they guarantee US during uh it's guaranteed that they will provide us with diesel fuel when we need it now is that a perfect thing probably not you know I mean if they just say they're at but they're supposed to provide it what's so we could provide we got a good price again on a piece of generator that still may be a good option for us even though we refer them as soon because we have natural gas right yeah foreign okay that's it anyone else yes so so the doc is done um I got filled up dirt coming out on a Friday with my stuff I didn't I won't have it done but either probably before that way involving um ordering a saw and getting it and getting it thrown down mixed in with other things is there a maintenance schedule as far as because there's going to be a lot of debris that comes up when we walk on a regular basis [Music] our current maintenance schedule walk at least once a week or when it's like in um when they come by and see that but explanation it hasn't been cleaned during the project we've kind of let it accumulated right now first thing I want you to know I don't know if city council knows but right now we are streaming uh Armenians live we have both a tate and a live meeting so people can join in starting at six o'clock on our Council night so again thank you Kyle next was you may notice here on Causeway that uh I was talking to some people or various citizens got together the car we had a meeting with the county and the citizens and we got a brand new fence installed uh County cave and installed it nice black beautiful dancing obviously we're working on his landscaping and potential funding for a fountain but the last one is a weird one um I got a phone call last week and it was about a floating um hiring and we walked about an 18th quarter uh obviously that would probably interview with a boat or it could be damaged bullets Etc I was able to get a rope on it pull it in and tie it up to appear the next day Kyle showed up with a complete crew and here's the weird one instead of just kind of grabbing the Rope how this one Trump's off he waited out pool and swam the piling all the way to the edge of the sea wall uh and then their team pulled it out chopped it up put it in there so Kudos just went home and moved everybody um so that's what we're working on so uh thank you very much for all your work anyone else on the council um 12-13 I'm sure that we've learned quite a few lessons it would definitely there's been a form of a challenge didn't we probably initially expected [Music] and it looks great uh the 7th Street back to above ground the edge of that ramp where it is to do with a draw bomb is that if you consider that to be a design block if you think of the engineers or the uh the installer did it incorrectly and now and I had to patch it up to make it usable I don't follow up marriage again his opinion he's got a lot of experience to see wolves and dogs are overamps in the area I would have to ask his opinion out now because he went out 10 feet in his design the idea is when we first went out there to figure out how big the existing was we attracted to about eight feet so we walked a little further than that now the um the actual the way that the state was at the time it kind of came up over that ramp so that you ran out into sand they don't know in the process of dredging moving that all around if it got moved so that depth ramp just became where it came out Beyond it um but if I'd like I'll get an answer for you on that and see he's fully aware of the situation I proposed the idea of moving it back so that it wouldn't it wouldn't be a drop-off and he approved of it but my biggest fear is that we took a functioning program pulled it out and put a non-functioning program in this place uh we're out there but if you can't bring it back and if this is a recurring problem uh I guess my question is if do we have any recourse on the installer if the engineer who designed even if it involves digging it out and redoing it we want to make sure that even though it's a very small program people that are using [Music] right so that's uh that's my comments on that uh other than that I appreciate all your hard work uh it's nice to see the progress and the transparency parents anyone else and just just is it possible to just talk to the engineer at County River Rapids design stabilization foreign ER now we are on to item eight it's the city clerk's report [Music] um I I'm on a website adding and deleting all day long so I didn't want to say that I had put it on there until I looked at it again but I did I just checked

all right I'm 12. this is for consideration to authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order for resurfacing the Morgan parking lot Mr reefer you have the floor okay so this purchase order is the authorized Banker Paving for the Milling overlay every scrubbing Morgan Park parking lot and the amount of 18 805 dollars paper Paving uh proposed the most competitive price of three separate proposals and they are the data company that we just recently performed uh 12 13 for the day right all anymore to the history of the parking lot I could not find the actual date that are the oldest part of the middle section of the parking lot is pain estimation definitely over 15 years old probably more I can be included some pictures of some of the wear and chairs that if you haven't been out there recently to see some of the weathering rotting there's transitional cracking going through some different areas some of the the SE is exposed but the last time I did was done and that probably not it was expanded for some additional parking spaces I think related to the uh comparison of the beach and you can see that in the picture it's just the line difference between forward [Music] the uh the budget we have a currently have funding in the budget accumulator up to 35 000 and it was described for a million resurfacing and concrete uh Professor further occurring a long ways and I looked at the existing curving in the walkways I would say is we don't take any flooding code for Saturday thank you for explaining that to us before we go to the council with the schedule for anyone like to speak on this topic oh all right so we're back to the council before we go to the discussion I need a motion to authorize the city manager to execute the purchase order for resurfacing the Morgan Park Morgan parking lot uh do I have a motion by Leslie material do I have a second okay second by Logan Roberts uh especially uh look at Miranda estimates speak for themselves [Music] other council members yes Mr Roberts the pilot for this particular project that we typically put together a requests for bed will be detailed because it's under a certain number how does the city typically handle that um that's under 25 000 we got a request proposals on and I give them the uh the parameters at least a inch million overlay but they had to restart it okay excellent the reason I asked was I know there was some slight differences in the actual hits that were submitted in a positive way I mean the winning the winning company actually is going to do ancient quarter which is great so so they just did that on their own all right thanks I did have a just one big dumb question but I'm going to ask it anyway um what it has saved us any money if we enrolled this project into the 12 and 13 page I talked to him about it when we were discussing that Paving and due to the mobilization of the distance between the two jobs did not think so because I always I did consider that before the holiday trying to get them in shut down thank you I have no other questions anyone else all right so let's take you to another long-haul move and please call council member Livingstone yes yes councilmember Notaro yes council member Roberts um [Music] you are authorized to proceed okay we had a unfinished business right right along we are on to item 14 which is a council um you know I had so much fun doing this with the computer so it's never going to be the same way twice except for the fact that vice mayor Shirley goes next to last and under the last this time to computer pick Mr Livingstone to the emergency oh good um I just have two questions the first one is in a previous meeting and this might not be the form of this I apologize in a previous meeting um we were talking about the piping and we couldn't find the documents um for that particular piping where we had an issue and then then for the paving we couldn't find a documentation of that painting I don't know if there's been some laws and acted since all this has taken place but what measures are we taking to make sure that we're able to find the appropriate documentation forward and this is no reflection on you by any means I just have that question um I'm glad you asked the city clerk and I kind of discussed what would make it easier when going through our records area it's all physical papers and bins so there's no easy way so some of the more current stuff they talk in here we can search it um modern technology but some of the older stuff in this I think predates and then we can search on our computer it you have to go through and kind of look at different indexes and try and figure out when it possibly could occur our solution and I want to if the price is on is to try to go before that we could start filing and going to get a lot more Surgical and the next question just has to do with work sessions well funny you should ask [Music] two weeks from today I believe it's the 23rd so uh [Music] and also just so you know whenever it's your turn to speak you can talk about anything you want to as long as you want to except for you make it a point if you want too long or you have to buy us all [Music] [Music] there's been a lot that this ambitious uh Council has been working on so in some months we had you know four or more but that's not that's the exception about the rule um so it's the fact that one's coming up is an indication of toilet paper and everything we try to especially we typically at least one but NBA senator all right next up the computer picked Floyd Brothers okay um thank you Aaron I had a conversation earlier today with my friend Randy and what I would like to recommend or propose is I think it's wonderful that we started meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance in addition to that I think we should actually open the meeting including a prayer I worked for a state Organization for many years and they had a board that was appointed by the governor and every monthly meeting that we had uh along with pledge allegiance somebody opened a meeting with a prayer so I would like to propose that we do that and I think you mentioned the upcoming Workshop I would like that to be an item on that Workshop where we discussed that and hopefully come up with a plan as to the best way to make that happen I think anytime we can get some help from somebody uh we need a prayer that would be a good thing so that's my recommendation thank you and uh [Music] to be discussed and I will also add that in the various meetings that I attend throughout the county for the majority of them and prayer and then do you think all right thank you very much all right next up is Mike cool uh since we're going out live I just want to reiterate uh if you want to contact the numbers 301-943-3443 don't worry about calling me just call me with a message I'll talk to you uh second is my email is mike.zabel cityofbelerbeach.com a reason I bring that up is during the latest hurricane this city has I gotta watch the terminology here there's a considerable number of people that find it difficult to live 35 pound bags and let alone fill them place them at their residence and what I'm asking for is if you need assistance or you have problems doing that physicality is I'm trying to assemble one list of those people with their addresses and compile that or match that to another list of volunteers that want to come out here when this Hits come out early fill the sandbags for these people and then distribute it to these houses too often it's maybe one person knows of somebody but a lot of these people really and I kind of say it they don't have friends they don't have an extended Network and too often they fall between the cracks and when you're between the cracks chances are you know you could be injured or die so I'm looking for that is you know come back to me and get some names assembled I like the right before the council to see if we can put that up that there's a series of people that you know may need it we can keep it in it but they have matched volunteers to assist them during the time of the hurricane that's all I have thank you thank you Mr cellular next step is the material yeah vice mayor Shirley um but she's done a great job [Music] these guys here and tell her thank you for all that service we do appreciate it and John thank you know we appreciate your help really if there's anyone else in this you know [Music] you know the board Physicians see Patty always looking for help around the city thanks for coming out in Pennsylvania [Music] all right as I mentioned earlier our next work session was on Monday January the 23rd few of the items that will be discussed include the new sign language and buildings on the beaches there's been some discussion it's originally raised by council member Baker placing buoys on the south end of I still considered our beach even though it's not on our beach in May and then also discussing holiday Lighting on Gulf and Causeway Boulevard I'm sure other things will be added but there's a little secret view of just Financial items that's been discussed um also I'd like to thank everyone who attending tonight happy New Year and uh all right all in favor aye aye to any opposed all right good night everyone [Music]"
