    "transcript": "foreign [Music] Council work session of city of Miller age with rise and enjoy Pledge of Allegiance services to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic which stands one nation under God indivisible for liberty of Justice foreign council member Frank Banker council member Belinda Livingstone president council member Leslie Otero your council member Lloyd Roberts president council member Mike zabel here mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle meafler City attorney Randy Mora president and vice mayor Jody Shirley has not yet arrived very much before we begin I would like to hear these work sessions three hours were all burned out and so we have even though there's only six mentioned agenda items they're pretty aggressive I figure by the time 9 o'clock Also if anyone needs a break between that being said let's just move right over to uh item number one discussion of those foreign relations tomorrow thank you Mr Mayor this was brought back to this Workshop not because of any action taken by the office of the City attorney but in the spirit of continuing the stated goal of revising your sign code some months ago this was presented to you with some introduction though it is admittedly lengthy and the council requested more time to digest it determine if it had feedback as there was this was generated sort of as a top-down approach when you folks have interviewed by firm and other firms and Upon Our being hired it was communicated that revisiting your signed code to make it compliance with the following the Supreme Court your students and jurisprudence and read the Gilbert and other cases on that this was a priority so we prioritize it accordingly and provided a draft accent direct input or guidance on what you were looking to address or what issues might exist in your community our firm has done this for a few communities in Pinellas County and we used it not I would not say a boil a cookie cutter template the one designed to your community based on previous drafts at this stage it was brought back with hopes that there may be some guidance and Direction ultimately you five a six seven at any given time but that this Council are the policy makers I will tell you what legally we need to change legally what you cannot do is treat temporary speech in a content-based manner ordinarily that may that made sense to us where we said okay we can't say if you're Pro this issue you get a bigger sign or a smaller sign but in the mid teens around 2015 or 2016 there was a Supreme Court case that said oh no no no when you characterize a temporary sign bias content election signs for example non-commercial directional signs this way to the church this way to the 5K you know come join our our fast our Festival those are also content-based restrictions and you can't do that and so they it fundamentally upended how a lot of sign codes were written in in the United States and in fact the dissent in that case made that very clear that this is going to be fundamentally changing most local regulations on signs and so that's what this reflects the way most communities have adapted to that is to have restrictions based on size number Etc with the understanding that if you limit the number of temporary temporary non-commercial signs that extends to what we mean for your campaign signs in a year where you have excuse me a presidential election a local election a ballot measure if you're saying you only get three temporary signs for capping it so understanding what that means big picture and so ultimately we've gone through we've harmonized this with the way your code is presently laid out and we welcome any input feedback you may have absent additional in addition to any line edits or concerns you may have about the draft excuse in addition to any line concern line edits or concerns you may have about the draft I wish to underscore again and the Seven of you are the policy makers as I said in a memo to another Community recently you are free to accept reject add to delete from modify and then what is before you this is given to you for the purpose of simulating a substantive discussion on the issue and allowing you to move forward the process from here if you do improve It ultimately you're planning zoning board we'll have to look at this as if we need a change in the Land Development regulations and it would come before you on a first and second reading as you all well know at this point we're not changing the rules tonight we're just trying to get a product that will ultimately yes very much Patty please make a note yes sir yes um so I went through this morning and I assumed that everywhere there's yellow markings that is this an acceptable number would you like overall it's way too much information obviously but from a labor perspective I'm sure it has to be this way because there is so what I would like to ask you to do is um everywhere there's one of these yellow highlights can we just jump to it and give a quick explanation for it and what it is you're looking for and then we'll go around the council and we'll try to knock those out sure and that's that is a mostly a very accurate reflection this was the yellow highlights as policy makers were to highlight this is where you're one where your regulatory ability on this is highest right I want to make sure you see the numbers were not put in there by legal and you don't say oh well it was it used to be 15 feet but you know legal said it had v17. no that's totally you folks and if we use some numbers from your code some numbers from others and if there's a number in there you don't like by all means change um to the extent anything has to be in here um it the the whereas Clauses while lengthy are done to bolster the possibility of a future defense I'm not going to represent to you that you absolutely must have them or we can't pass this I do want to make that clear that I respect your your Authority as the policy makers member card so with that I am I'm pulling up pulling up the ordinance at the moment Mr Mayor had it in hard copy but I want to make sure to look at the digital so I can more quickly get to the highlighting so with that I don't need any guidance anymore the first one is abandoned or discontinued designer structure or signer structure is considered abandoned or discontinued when its owner fails to operate or maintain a sign for a period of at least it's presently 60 days this is really targeted towards most especially where you have that and we've all seen this especially following the recession that major business in your community again in your community you don't really have a business district but let's say to the extent you have the Condominiums the building gets destroyed post some unfortunate natural disaster and then that sign sits there for another five years because yes they technically own the property and they're not doing anything with it what is an abandoned sign and what are the what are the regulations that flow from that so with that in mind 60 days was a number if you have a number that you wish differently or an opinion on the matter by all means business okay the 60 days of fun to me but I have a question going through it how soon once you hit the 60 days we should have in there at that point we declare it I guess there's a turn how long did they have to remove it say you had 60 days you make a statement and then now you have two weeks before you move sets on so what my hesitation is only to explain first how code enforcement typically works because there is the notion that you are in violation of our code versus when you actually comply or when we get some kind of order of compliance because let's say we deem a sign abandoned and there's and I have to revisit some element of this what what requirements extend because this is just the definition section you know what what obligations flow from that so um but I I think it is in the code thereafter but let's say the code says that an abandoned sign that says signs that are deemed abandoned prohibited signs and under 86 4 so on page 26 of this is where that flows to and it says that signs that are deemed abandoned under this chapter that do not perform with the provisions of this section shall be removed by the property owner within 30 days after received notification which will immediately follow the 90-day and that would have to harmonize that a 90-day abandonment period described in this chapter that such removal is required so they would get 90 days once Dean removed I mean sorry 30 days from that notice but let's say they don't that doesn't mean on day 31 the city hires a hauling company and we take it away it means they're in violation of the code they're going to get a hearing date they're going to go before magistrate the Magistrate's going to say come into compliance like xdate if they don't then they'll get a fine for every day pass that day and if they continue to ignore it the final Cruise so there's this unsatisfying result on some level where somebody says I thought they had to remove that thing in 90 days it's still sitting out there and it's been six and seven months what's going on here City well there's a fire coming in the background and then that we can potentially get a lien for that and all those every other matter of legal results but the idea that we're going to show up with our own Hauling Company and start taking everything on day 91. 61 or whatever it is is not perhaps a note in there because sometimes you know we'll these actual things to the citizens and somebody's going to come back why aren't you well perhaps in a later section going okay once you've done this it goes into the normal flow which is I don't think it's helpful to codify the code enforcement process in the code so in that sense it's the national operation operation of Law and due process takes over now let's say 30 days what's the what's how much time does the the property or the sign owner actually have before we can go remove this we will not be removing the sign I have Cindy court order to that effect so what would happen is let's say we have that result and we have the special Master holding their in violation and they need to remove it and we're still not getting satisfaction then we would have to file an injunctive action in the court as the plaintiff functionally suing a property owner in the city and get a court order that they need to remove it or give us the right secure in that case and I I'm involved in a very similar matter in another community and it has taken us 10 years and that structure is still there Point table well let's just kind of go around the room here and see what everyone thinks on this I also remember the tarot yeah we're talking about the 60 days 60 days I think that's reasonable I think that's reasonable council member Roberts um I agree with that so we're going to remove sunshines in 60 days and other signs stair s definitely and I did not say that sir well this the short answer is yes if somebody has a sign in their front yard that says save all manatees and it's a temporary sign we're not going to remove that at any point that's political speechers [Music] distribution of this law okay the Supreme Court ruling is crystal clear respectfully disagree especially well the sense of concurrences and lots since 1789 you attorneys can't get together that's what we have a supreme court and the problem here is you got what 27 Pages 30 pages of design evidence and it still would be challenging the court because you're allowing one person to do this or one enemy to do this in this big you're allowed to leave here for 30 days and while we cure it definitely I think I think you're joking way ahead on this I'm trying to accept you it's when I'm just talking about Abandoned and discontinued science I understand that but this is all nonsense and this is just going to get us into trouble and child encouragement I would never hurt myself like this I would never impose a mind Residence at 30 page coordinates for this site and and I just asked your legal advisor if it's the majority's will that we do not have an ordinance that reads this way I'm happy to put it in place and while I respectfully uh disagree with the characterization of this I want to be very clear that none of this is driven by a profit motion it is driven by a desire to dutifully represent your community in a way that I have responsibly done and would continue to do but I respect your policy decision to disagree with the proposal and survive if the majority of your body was just going away I completely respect that won't do so council members I agree with 60 days vice mayor Shirley 60 days is great with me council member of the Big Stone I'm in agreement with 60 days and I'm fine with that also all right the next highlighting Mr Mayor is on the bottom of page 13 where concerns the definition or area of sight and so the calculation for a double face sign shall be the area of one face only double face sign shall be so constructed that the perimeter of both faces coincide and are parallel and not more than 24 inches apart so that's the depth of the sign if you have a sign that's two-sided that it can't be a whole six feet on one side and six feet on the other essentially the other cube of the Sun and again we're just in the definition assumption faces coincide you know parallel I didn't understand this whenever I read the versions the depth separating side one and side two is the thickness of the sun are they 24 inches apart yeah that's that's the idea here's the sign now you're talking about 24 48 50. that's more of a monument sort of like what we have and that's and that is that Monument signs come up in this and that's let's go to the opposite direction I'm going to start with the customer I don't know if you're talking about a temporary sign I mean I accept your legal expertise on 24 inches 24 inches so it's kind of wide to me I would so this is for all sides the definition is this is not specifically okay okay I think it would be a little less I think we probably could be like 12 inches like a foot depth of a to allow cabinet of provided or something like that um council members able I could go from 12 to 18. is the because you have to have some room for Bulbs Etc council member I renew my objections is possible with the unconstitutionalized Mr Roberts department just one example of that type of son I think you started to get one so what would be an example just so I get another visual if you pull up to a McDonald's and they've got a sign out the dark let's say at the base there put the Arches on one side and the arch on the other side and in between it's a block so when you're on either side of that it's house how far apart is each golden arch if you're looking at sideways right now a dentist's office all those sorts of monuments like how far apart is each side of it and it's to avoid somebody taking up I think because when mostly residential like I think 12 would be funny well just for arguments saying how wide is um four to six inches uh well that would be fine the 24th so there's 224s 3 12 and an 18. you had 18 so now it's it's split s Monument there's a there's a difference first for Government properties of this and that's also consistent with the Constitutional guidance but I would say that uh ultimately if there is a sign have a non-employment structure the structure would likely endure until such time as the structure of the sign was destroyed in which case it would have to come into compliances and again this is the workshop phase if at some point you after today you start realizing I didn't quite know we were looking at something like that or you drive around and start seeing things this is just to get the process started right after we make these changes will be presented with an updated copy and hopefully more highlights and the next definition is artwork uh top of the very next page if the Slate is a two-dimensional representation on a flat surface the same shall not exceed a quarter of the total surface area however if this means so and then the next one is a half it was definitely okay council member Baker originally prefer that I just did not call on you during this conversation you can call me for the record I'm going to repeat my objections is possible constitutional nonsense I mean this is just vehicles and I will continue calling on you then council member of anchor I'd like to hear your opinion on this about science I renew my objection to these other constitutions that are possible I'd say um I'm sorry I just thinking graphically yeah one quarter is fine that's the graphics and then obviously underneath or above or sideways is the letter AIDS in something hotel in our phone number No Vacancy I'm an agreement good I'm just curious is this any surface that they decide to turn into a sign I believe it is yes is potentially and again that like that would this is I would it depends factor of every legal issues but potentially so the campaign sign for examples [Music] great question there are some our code also has some language about how your house can be painted right so that would take care of that problem the reason why I'm asking this question is because I'm just trying to clarify this assigned policy override or other rule uh is the property design paint landscape that you said that's that's why I brought in high school verification that's a question I'll digest some more I I just been trying to think about it in the backing of this moment and not the best position to give you an answer that's fine I will agree uh tentatively agree with you initially though Mary I would say that like an election is not a creative idea as that within the scope of that definition yeah I'm not sure about this I mean is it if I'm the sign or on the wall of the place you're talking projection from foreign [Music] the definition of a projecting sign is any sign if it's perpendicular or at any angle to a building or wall in such a manner that its Leading Edge extends more than and here it says 12 inches beyond the surface of such a linear wall standard Channel set letters on signs do not render sign um so here are projected sign is any significance again to the to the front of the building or or at enabled perpendicular I guess to a building or wall in such a manner that it's Leading Edge extent more so if you're if you've got coming out of here candy shop and it goes more than 12 inches beyond the surface of the building or wall that it's extending from it can only be 12 inches and again I want to reiterate especially to Echo Mr um Mr Baker's present position I want to be very clear there's a kind of sign you like honestly I don't want that regulated we don't have to regulate it you folks are the policy makers we have given you that here is everything in the universe to consider and um you can take it believe it modify it as you wish thank you very much it's not terrible foreign so that's defining what a projective sign is but under 86-4 which we'll get to in a few pages there's a list and while I did not specifically highlight anything because again all of this is up for discussion as we look at these definitions be mindful that some of these signs are prohibited a projecting sign is a prohibited sign under this as drafted portable signs roof signs all prohibited signs remember we're in the this isn't a restriction as much as it is a definition it is 22. and the vehicle sign is a sign which covers more than 10 square feet of the vehicle identifying a business product service and which is attached to mounted pasted painted or drawn on a motorized or drawn vehicle and is parked and visible from the public right-of-way unless the vehicle is used for transporting people or materials in the normal day-to-day operation of the business I think that definition speaks for itself again whether or not you wish to regulate that in a certain way is addressed later on I was remember Livingstone as far as the description I'm fine we're going to address them later on with me council members [Applause] for the safe experiencing machine standing objection now it could change all right Mr Roberts yeah so if it is less than 10 square feet it's more what is it that might as well not a vehicle sign I'm just curious if it's more than a test and it would not constitute if you just have a square foot distance okay so later on when they reference the vehicle sign they'll know that if something is more than transverse it sounds to me uh where you count the number of square feet uh small magnetic sign on each one of your doors will be accepted or would not we couldn't qualify as a leadership this materials I'll agree with that one also point out yourself two signs two by three as well as 13. the next thing going to highlight in Mr Mayor in the event any member went through this particularly and had concerns they do want to make sure the list of prohibited signs on pages 26 through 28 are reviewed and make sure there's any vehicle signs are one of those this is vehicle signs visible from the street right away from an under the vehicle Department that's how that reads again just not any languages there's not a this is exactly what you should have but is intended to make you give you the opportunity to evaluate that said I wasn't sure if there was any input on the prohibited signs as you read that list and sometimes it may require you to go back to the definition section and know precise label a is I just wanted to make sure that you did take a moment to look at a list of prohibited signs and see if anything gave you a concern based on the particular dynamics of your community or policy decisions okay so maybe what we should do is everyone gone through this list did anyone see other than councilmember Lake did anyone see something so snipe signs are colloquially those signs that you just see Pop Up All Around come in my Karate Dojo and things like it's thrown in you right-of-way and the like those are typically what colloquially that is definition reads assignment of any material when such sign is tacked nailed posted pasted loot or otherwise attached to or placed on public property such as but not limited to a public utility pole street sign utility box fire hydrant right-of-way public Street Furniture or other public property and then as except for an A-frame or two frame sign that is temporarily released some type of property under such limitations and constraints I just wanted to verify that because of the case these are rare but with Marathon they'll frequently put the route signs up on and those are typically permitted pursuant to their special event of the permit and all the other wayfaring requirements they go through to be able to have that many things as permitted event not a call me for guitar lessons so absent any specific feedback and again this is just our first move through of this I'll just continue to the next highlight unless there is a different problem unless the council was just to proceed differently next highlighting right here sorry there's plenty of job sites where drivers are partnered with signage on the vehicle well in your community being smaller tighter what's visible from the right of ways bigger than what you might see in a community where there's more separation so if you that's definite prohibited in the prohibited sign list it's half path on page 28 of the documents one night after all um so if if that's a prohibited sign category definition you wish to replace it by all means or restriction that's right I thought it allowed it under the previous screen um unless said vehicle is used for transporting people and material to the normal data operation of the business so if I got an electrician handyman that's working there eight hours he's in the day-to-day operation of this business so that type of sign us more than 10 floors on the side of his van that's okay because I'm not so sure that's how that's intended to operate because by definition every vehicle is intended to transport people I'm not so sure that's how that definition will be applied revisit that the way I see it is bad but I am saying that you have several construction tractors I see around Tabernacle contractor's name on them that are parked on the site during the tournament of construction period so color on the side of the dumpster actually no revisiting and seeing vehicles used for transporting people materials in the normal day-to-day operation of the businesses so it dumps her et cetera they're all okay I would I would I would read that that way but again I will flag that as something that I give particular attention to um and its application at that is there anything else to jump out foreign use on page 30 at the very bottom number 20 sign for not performing use it's easy to be used for a period of 60 consecutive days and that's consistent with the abandonment definition that we've done earlier is replaced by conformities shall be considered a prohibited sign that shall be removed you do have very limited uses in your community but if for example you had and I saw this in another Community for example we have an old used car lot where you couldn't put a used car lot today and they stopped selling used cars for 90 days you know and one is that band of business but it's a non-conforming sign you know for a non-conforming use hey yeah and they also have a giant let's say they have melted price of a bearing or something in the sky there an old Chef 57 Chevy on full okay you've been it's non-point use and I know three signs it's that just that 60 days I think given the guidance earlier on abandonment that's consistent um a member has a concerned about it beyond the standing protection is everyone fine with 60 days the same with the scientists continued so I'll continue to scroll through for yellow highlighting document um as lengthy as the document is we're nearing the end of things that we're specific with the fact on page 38 . on 8619 temporary sign installation removal unless otherwise provided for this chapter and I'll tell you that this is where a lot of communities have spent a lot of time in their ordinances yes sir we were on the 30 and then you went to 38 31. oh I'm sorry the 31 was another 60 days on an abandoned sign I didn't call it out but it was another discontinued sign and it was consistent I again would say by that being consistent okay the next thing is temporary sign removal section 8619 unless otherwise provided for in this chapter temporary science shall not be erector for more than 100 days prior to the event being advertised on the temporary sign begins and they shall be removed promptly at the event at the events conclusion temporary sun is not advertising an event to occur on a specific date but which are related to the occurrency expected future with better transaction including unlimited to real estate for sale sign shown up and be subject to the 100-day provision of the subsection with such times shall also be removed promptly upon the earliest of the occurrence of the event or transaction so if you're saying for sale you don't know when the sale is going to happen so you might be out for 100 days and one sale happens it comes up I mean it's that real estate regulation is off as an example not a regulation directed based on content uh and so in this in this particular case um the hundred days that's what apply to an election you can't put if you agree as Britain you can't put a vote for Randy sign out more than 100 days before election day notwithstanding early voting notwithstanding the ways that those constructs have changed and so that same is true on the Coleman for the Cure run on November 10th or something so understand it's it makes it frustrating for some policy makers because you're treating too inherently to similar things in a similar way but that is the construct that we're operating on your day some session about 60 days see that sorry [Applause] forgive me it has been a moment since I looked at the document in full and remembered all of its content yes those are those aren't there political scientists days I'm going to tell you that that drafting notice was drafted in cooperation with one of my colleagues I want to make sure we revisit that just to make sure that we're still based on some more recent cases I'm still good with that but yes and at this point I would ask for your input as it's written so the 100 days for um 100 days for general rule concerning temporary signs if you wish and again that would be come in the state whatever no no earlier than 100 days before the special s so I'm curious why uh 101 create that number it's not based on a very specific policy it's it's based a number that's been seen in other codes whether if you wish to make a 90 45 that's again we're looking to you and that's why it's there as a place not there as the gold standard in this room primarily be foreign [Music] oh so that uh page 38 would be 30. 30 understood and an hour to page 39. foreign as far as removing them candidates for federal state county municipal or district office as you get them out within 30 days or candidates for City officers within 72 hours yeah what's the difference well the candidate is here locally you know walk beyond that store and pull the side versus Kent State office they got to get their campaign worker because they organize that and that was my thought behind that that's what it is all of them yeah potential placements are in a resurrection yeah it's going to be a challenge from here which you have to improve it so they can take it out [Music] definitely uh my spiritual is on the summit I think that the elections the local elections that we have for working and we're going out what we're doing assigned a signier and then who does it three days and within three days we go right out usually the next day we pick them right back up the other signs are actually being placed by normal they're going and getting those signs so it's a different situation and they may not necessarily be there maybe 15 days or something yeah it never seems like a lot but gosh we're 14 days two weeks everyone agree with that okay yes understood that was is that shortening the 30 to the 14 or yeah three numbers there I want to make sure all the time remains in 72 hours [Music] yeah this is this is where a lot more of the of the work is done in this draft in the temporary signage restrictions and meets web definition so that the next page is Page 41. um science lab in all districts in a permanent required temporary signs shall be allowed on each parcel as follows enumerated the districts the number of signs and their General dimensions which are the most common ways to regulate these most read guilder well let's start back on page 40 and uh sorry 40. I said for you again for you temporary Sciences okay so let's start with number one there on the RL District four temporary science shall receive four square feet in any sign area and four feet and high are they talking about single side inside so you can put four single-sided signs or four double sided sides how about that assignment I think that is the signs are one in the same way is that correct I'm sorry I I was distracted could you say that again are we making up sounds if it sounded that way well that was made you were in the direction of the laptop I'm sorry okay we'll go back to the question about are you talking about single-sided or double-sided signs right this this portion of the code makes no distinction between a single-sided and a double-sided sign okay that's the way I read it also about the size anybody okay with that all right okay we do then uh number two in the RN District each parcel they explain one temporary sign which you'll notice see 24 square feet in the inside area and six feet in height ultimately each parcel of the orange District May display up to eight temporary signs which a few of those are doing the channel and obviously 24 square feet inside area [Applause] so and what you're saying is if a business wants to stack their signs a certain way or that's okay if they want to meet those dimensions and requirements this would be permitted again none of these numbers are offered at some gold standard if you wish to change anything you're free to get a brief question uh as we regarding the RRM I'm not sure so the URL is the residential versus honors District um we've got 10 units in our building if I really wanted to put out a different political science project there aren't that many people running but um what is your initial racing okay what is your HOA sale I don't know what it says because some of you say yes no I'm just saying something I don't know and again this it's a point well raise if you have a Condominium Association or homeowners association with its own restrictions we don't enforce that but they they could and would and say hey in addition to the city saying you guys have eight according to us no res no resident is allowed to put anything in the common grass in the you know in our front engine so it might be zero even though we we say we give them a they might say it's zero because they were against all yeah anyone uh want to challenge that when are you okay with these these numbers okay all right number three temporary science displayed Outdoors shall be constructed a metal plastic blood pressure with a non-card board or paper very supportive conversation 4 inches out of four inches just trying to figure out exactly what support that would be they mean the age brackets like a real estate signpost that makes more sense so there's no right or construction company right foreign [Music] [Applause] that'd be in violation of this event like that it's been up for at least seven years thank you I gotta replace the Rope on it as I just I know I know it sounds redundant but I have to make it very clear for the record none of this is established as something standard yeah do you guys do what makes sense for your community and if you want any of those numbers changed in your previous years um [Music] the United States flag a Florida flag and that is 80 square feet from the United States flag yeah I'm sorry I think there were provisions if you have any of that Authority I'm always happy to consider it hey Val I'd just like to change this would be two flags moderators all right no uh 80. yeah two flags not yeah I was thinking about age playing yeah they don't have an each on this one they got the Eastern Europe not totally greater than 80 square feet yeah and then uh flag thank you [Applause] again parallel District 35-foot flagpole in the our own District larger larger ability in the past yeah the reasoning was the differences and uses between the two permissible uses and the two from this one historical uses in the two but if you wish to organize them you're free so on page 41 to 25 uh are we going to ask Mr Jose 30 okay I'm fine with 30 or 35 our our building restrictions we can't go any higher than 35 feet on our instructions so it's just harmonizing the 35 35 right and literally change the square footage it was it was a total of beauty but I think what it really wasn't Australia is one flag or even had two flags but neither flag could be larger than each course understood [Applause] So Randy just just curious to me and would be what says flags and then it talks about not greater than 15 which are changing from 40 degree each square feet and then it says inside area so is that just interchangeable a flag and a sign would it be more appropriate to say flag is a sign okay okay so on the section two page 41 we're talking about the RM they're allowed to have two flag poles 35 feet but then they're limited to one on one place am I reading that correctly sorry I'm trying to make sure everything's in place three flags not greater than 24 square feet uh in sign area of two flag holes are allowed I think that if you're gonna do this they're probably going to have one maybe you know that each end of the property they can have to be side by side but ultimately why not allow them to have four and give them the same rules you can put two flags on it if you have two player holes and you can have a total of four Flags does that sound all right so it's very close yeah the square footage would be 40 per flag total of four Flags but more than two flags and if we have anything in here that is rashes these I forget my example you may know what the actual name of it is but it's the team configuration where that is the traditional Yacht Club putting across me so you got the main mast in the crossword put those signal plates and then they stream single planks all the way top to bottom and get a washer because sometimes you like putting different sports so that's not been addressed by the way I'm sorry y'all probably because we have somebody in the hotel that does have a I think it's like a eight-footer enhancement [Music] do we just enable that is a single flag and ignore the uh all right Mr Miller would you like to uh reviews parking space science hotel motel apartment on state parks on-site parking space number or identification signs not exceeding two square feet thank you excuse me of signed Facebook sign shall be allowing each parcel within the RN district one such sign shall be allowed for each parking space maximum height for a freestanding or attachable sign is six feet to me the pre-directed support saying there but again if you wish to change that I think that's pretty consistent with DOT you're not good with that one yeah um similarly this really street address signs and those put on residential mailboxes limit of one attached Wall Street address sign ature sign should not exceed two square feet inside area does that include some people put their house number on the curb within your English mental possibly excuse me Wall Street address I don't think as written that it would it could it would extend to a curb as it says the wall and the mailbox that's right I really wish for it to be explicitly accepted or included please let me know everyone okay with that yeah warning signs and safety size uh they're saving four square feet inside areas otherwise are we talking about a good example a hazardous speech today something like that what what type of warning sometimes are we talking about research on page and tight like a hole in the lot like I mean any high voltage gas lines fall into power mode the way it reads in the definition section is a sign which provides warning with dangerous condition or situation it might not be readily apparent that poses a threat of serious injury EG for example a gas line high voltage condemned building Etc where that provides warning of a violation of law example you know trespassing no hunting allowed Etc potentially less warning or square feet that could be anywhere I'm trying to think of like a that's a one line two by two two yeah I'm trying to think that you know you see that and then trespasses oh the traditional [Music] that's usually to keep somebody from entering your property but if you're driving down the street and there's something at all possibilities of where a warning signs for instance like there's a signed mailed to a tree that's bridge that says no trespassing of fishing or something technology I'd like to speak to the citizens in the audience tonight is a work session this is not a typical where we take citizen comments about about any subject that happens to be on your mind at the time I see that I have quite a few okay uh whenever we get to items that are on the agenda I will call upon you for these particular ones that I've seen one about selling property I can't help it with that one tonight however you're welcome to hang around until the end of the meeting and speak to any of us and we'll uh we'll try to respond to and the purpose of that is to keep this meeting going and we will be wrapping up this meeting at 9pm so we'll all be available if you want to speak with us correctly questions I'm sorry wait till after the meeting for questions so we've got several things that are on the agenda that I I will be more than happy to say here a European uh but I can't promise you that we'll get to it because this is a it's interesting and I I texted beforehand to see if the speaker Mothers Day but if that's the case in case as long as there's actually nothing in the past and I can address that if you're not specifically anything as a matter of the rules of procedure nothing no official accident all issues is a work session and feel free to contact any of us and whenever we do our regular council meeting on the first Monday of every month the very first thing that we do is we take citizen comments and if there happens any concern about a certain agenda I will call upon you at that time for the perfect I can just get done earlier thank you thank you okay where was he Waterfront identification scientists remember unless you unless you folks are still concerned about the court B on warning signs okay any issues with that one vice mayor Shirley I mean I don't know I think you should consider producing the size of that but four foot sign is a pretty good sign for a big man to a tree yeah I agree with you on that everyone else bill that's at least the way I read this one this is going to be on the waterfront visible from the water she was still on the morning yeah the Morningside yeah I I avoid you I understand that one it should be too late too at all yeah okay what's that size does everyone else agree with vice versa do you just want to make it two square feet right yes one and a half by one would be obviously wanted to ask for a b which would be less than two how about the uh of course if it says that would constitute a snake selling the the yes then back to the Waterfront identification science do you have a problem leaving that in four square feet of that one because you need to be able to do this yeah all right temporary window signs for a hotel motel one more temporary window signs may be displayed on the inside of the window cover more than 50 percent of the area of the window except that if the hotel or hotel displays their signs it also is playing with one permanent sign when the sign authorized by this chapter in the total area of the window covered by a combination of these 30 of the area of the window you know this is for a hotel motel where they put in there like No Vacancy just a little camper science well we don't have a hotel in downtown on the beach that's right even though it looks like one it sounds like one you know if there's any category of this that you just don't think is necessary regularly straight up from many or if you think this too too much you could just I think that you could leave it in or take it out and it's not going to make any difference well my recommendation to you is if you don't think it makes any difference in your community then you likely don't need and you can take it out it's a stripe in her eyes everybody okay with that yeah actually wait wait until we get through our is page 42. shall not exceed 12 square feet is this the holiday signs talking about I think that this is probably applies to us also but that's a pretty darn big sign for a banner 12 square feet and it's not terrible at 3.6 2x6 uh 420 feet I bet that those are two or three yeah something like that okay depends on whether you're a palm tree or a starfish I'm fine with that size and this is something to consider because we're looking at uh doing other things in the future I have thought actually I know I saw Kyle and his crew putting up a sign on the building recently was definitely yeah so my thought was you know because I see cables going across the street then I think we discussed this previously one time that we put a permanent cable just the permanent cable across the same height that would have to be hired a little lower cable is already there just so we're not causing any issues and then whatever time the signs of banners that we want to believe or advertising or something you know we could just put that on there sweep it across and it's up in less than two minutes I like the idea but it's not code or not it's not a code discussion are you talking across now I'm just talking like uh you know crossing the street right here so when you're coming across the bridge and you're going home or the other direction so there it is you're gonna tie the cable across the street correct like I said it would have to be higher than a little bit of the lowest terms requirements would have to be higher so in other words because there are cables that go right across that street okay well that's what I was bringing it up to about the size of the banner but we could be the topic I think okay this is uh strictly for light bulbs is what this is discussing okay 12 and 20. everybody okay with that yes [Music] okay uh we are at B2 which is temporary science and construction sites the Science Channel 32 square feet I'm assuming this is the coming soon great big beautiful big mansion okay four by eight okay everybody okay with 24 and sure this for more 24-32 history minimum of 10 feet from all property lines yes probably I would say two feet from property line because you've got your easement and then your property so yeah that's true okay so you're agreed like two or three days but you can't put it in the setbacks so if you're a couple feet in from that easement which is what is it 3D well you have to put right away so that's right yeah and then then it starts to problems from about 10 to 15 from the actual Road why would you even have a number there just say uh it's illegal to place one of these signs in the right of way 86 23 a permanent wall window or volume assignment as well for any such buildings are complex not to exceed 24 square feet a monument size she's six feet in the height history this would be their permanent sign stating who they are this is the dolphin condos saying like the monument side that announces like this is Vista Del marona Del Rey yeah this is um that's that's how that would be the Hollywood sign that you think that's uh it's no bigger than what we're doing with the temporary science for construction companies thank you yeah I think it's fine for me all right and we're just saying yeah it's not the only because they're like directional the next provision um and there's a difference here between a window or a Monumental side and such I mean there are there are different ones so it's the main one issues I can scroll to a mirror if there's a lot if there's a definition you want red for the benefits Correctional signs that's uh telling renter exit right four square feet for those most of those are inside the property anyways yeah assignments square feet that covers any kind of sign or again if they want to put the name of the complex on the building that's where that you know that's the most most directly what that's addressing I guess everybody is okay with c feeding the canopy or awning sign may be permitted uh let's see here instead of a little ball sign and their awning and signage square footage combined shall not exceed until permissible square footage of course either the pan of your awning shell not exceeds 16 feet first floor or 25 feet per second floor everybody okay with his eyes yes yes refining Correctional signs on motel or hotel condominium or apartment property providing such science denizing four square feet which matches what we've already just discussed the directions shall not exceed four feet in height together that is [Music] with page 43 temporary Banner size science denied seeking 35 square feet in area condominium or apartment building in conjunction with a grand opening for a maximum of 60 days from the date until the first notice I guess an example that would be a brand new condo to make Knock one open house foreign [Applause] product I'm happy to look at that as well and with that unless there's any other action I'll incorporate these revisions work with staff and would you folks like to see this I'm not trying to meet you but do you want to see this again before this goes to Planning and Zoning or do you want me to want us to clean this up take this p and z and then come back to you I just want to make sure we have shared expectations I would like to see it cleaned up at everything or the changes I put in that I would like to Highlights to remain so they can see specifically because even though it's a lot of material It's relatively okay to get it on the open any uh any other comments from the Council on this particular topic this living so I have a question what are the next steps in this before it goes to planning and zoning and then great question so procedurally how this would normally work if you folks are subject to any other input you might have you clean this up it's already basically an ordinance format so we're not talking about an idea that needs to be drafted take the ordinance to them and say hey go look at the commission is looking at changes they would have a meeting much like the one you just had make their recommendations to you you would adopt them protect them ultimately you're the governing body and you'd have a first reading if you wish what we likely do given the nature of this particular ordinance is maybe have one more Workshop you don't have to um again if you folks don't feel that necessary what would happen is you'd have a first reading so you'd have a council meeting I would read it by title only and again you go through and say you know hey we've had two workshops on this Planning and Zoning has made the additional changes do you wish to change this any further do you wish to scrap it you know because an ordinance can fail just because it presented as an email and then we would have in assuming it passes we would have to have a second meeting that meeting would be advertised on the ordinance title will be advertised in the paper again we would take public comment at the first meeting in the second and then ultimately a second vote if it passes again then it's made part of your code would it not be or would it be unreasonable to ask if Kyle and his team while all this is going on in the background the for the RN properties just to kind of do a visual on say their flagpole Heights or their signage just to make sure because if we're off by say one foot or what have you you hate for them to go to the expense of and just report back and say you know everything's currently within what we're asking or there's this one it's six weeks larger but this other one has one that's one foot or I think it's perfectly appropriate for again this was drafted an initial draft the one you're looking at was drafted by the lawyers saying here's what we got to do long for absolutely staff shoot could make the effort of going through and making sure hey based on the numbers we're talking about does this present an issue in our community and that can be part of any staff reporting to you as we go through that process to say hey I know we all talked about 35 but actually half the ones in this community are 36 or whatever that is but I I the only the only couching I would do of that is to say you know that as we do each ordinance it's not customary to have renderings and everything every single time so it's not so as not to create that kind of expectation but given the nature of this and it's and it's city-wide application certainly and also U.S council members you folks are part of that process while staff can do we say staff you guys have a pretty lean team um well staff can do that it's also helpful for you folks if you say Hey you know we went in through this in another community and they're like hey but what about the fish restaurant that's been here 45 they've got this giant thing out there like okay we need to either address that or decide his community that don't want it anymore whatever the thing is and reflect that in an ordinance so as you look around in light of having gone through this now you you are part of that process and if you wish to inform staff I have some concerns what we were talking about based on properties X Y and Z that please let us know so I have a a recommendation America's planning Consulting there's a good possibility that they're going to disagree on some of the recommendations that we're making so what I would like to see is after planning is depends only reviews it whatever the changes are online for the district line so that you can quickly see where the need to see what their recommendations were I think one more work session to review their replicated changes and we could probably sit through it in 5-10 minutes and uh and then put it in front of the council but not this coming back but the next the next meeting in which it is and do we uh what what is the next meeting today first things will you be able to have this prepared for them by then we could but candidly I don't think they would have the sufficient time to digest it and they would be in a position where they'd say thanks Kyle can we meet on this again my suggestion to you is that before Wednesday's meeting we get into that we can get it to them as soon as next week in terms of these edits and I'm only saying next week because I know what my current case of it is this week but we could have it to them as soon as Monday next week and say hey start digesting this now um [Music] we have to wait in perfectly so let me calls this afternoon you go down which is close to the publishers I have not seen us value that you know that much I'm sorry I can't hear you how much would this cost to put it in oh this just by title you're into the code he's saying to publish on Munich if we were to publish on beauty code What would munico charge us to add this to the to our codified yeah online database yeah well they're only going to do the changes they don't do 45 pages but then it's hard to do I'm sorry what it's all it's all changes but they also know that DACA Warehouse yeah they're not going to do 45 pages but what they will do is I think they do a page before and a page after that they charge you for so really there's no way to really estimate what they're going to charge because of what change they make like Randy said they're not going to go line by line they're just going to make the changes they need to but then they're going to add in the additional pages so I mean I could look up a previous something similar in I didn't know I didn't know they had a course in fact yeah they do but then we don't know how many pages that's going to take them their Pages aren't like our pages right uh make a request uh [Music] actually [Music] okay all right and that is a discussion of movies installed and maintained at failures for ancient accessories [Music] last meeting however based on Mr Baker's request I decided to pursue this and I address the bellairs for commission concerning this and the way that I appreciate it was [Music] not speaking specifically for the city tomorrow are they what is scenario and so I asked him the question and yeah and writing and he's also gone spoken can we provide you with buoys in your town fully funded and maintain them and the answer was yes they would allow us to do that and then I said okay I will bring this information and I will see what the council would like to do so my initial thoughts on this before we get into the discussion on it I wanted to go ahead and share my thoughts was that filler short even though we do not own that property that is our beach too [Music] of our age we should do on the south at the beach and not drink the citizens any differently so if we're going to put every 100 yards of foods on the norfoli's foreign applying for the city manager to give us a rundown on what we're expecting to pay to do a project like this can I just briefly say anything I was an apple dollar shirt and they said you did a super job to make sure you're safe and I really appreciate it thank you very much so the costs involved you're looking at I calculated 16 across flood zone for them to take stepmother down to the South the jurisdiction that we better do about 18 markers and the price for that is roughly around five thousand dollars and that covers their entire beats or only the accesses the entire Zone like continuing the hard zone all the way down all the way down I guess and then uh for the installation I got a recent quote from uh who usually comes in Columbus for our 16 workers we're looking at twenty thousand dollars 20 2800 so I'm assuming because of the full days of work it could be roughly the same whether it's two more movies or not they're very close to it can you repeat so twenty thousand eight hundred dollars for installation and five thousand The Parkers children and that is all the way that is completely covers all of Millions yes that would cover from first to 19th right there's um if okay so that's only this Southern their half twenty thousand percent installation that's 16 workers so and then what's the cost for uh 19 to Harrison I'm just curious about the project give or take it's roughly the same thing basically the numbers on what it is okay there's my costs so fifty thousand dollars so now what's this the one single number ball bar that that we're paying for our City's paying for in order to get the ruins the first thing I would say 27 27 000 yeah okay so that's the new movies being put in installed and ready to go yes okay now a whole topic of that um let's just safely reset the clock on the live span of these dudes you said they're good for how long on average a couple of years a couple years I say at least one year I mean our last batch we didn't start to see them go away for over two years but that kind of depends on what the storm cycle is so I mean average level three appreciate it you see we get a free month soar you know our first year out of pictures so if they start staggering a little bit and eventually say maybe three five three years a year or three they're okay we'll all have been a replacement so if it's not a get expensive to build smaller but still stand behind whatever we do for the north we should do for the South even those in our future because our citizens our residents are walking across the street and once they cross the access just because they have to leave their umbrellas there doesn't mean that they're not swimming everywhere else yeah they think that they're not putting chairs out on the sand so they use their meats just like we use our beach I I again whatever we do for the city needs to be for the entire city and not just for the North or the South is I don't think the contractor is supply has a technology changed any since the last time we actually dealt with noise from the standpoint of those newer technology out there that will hold those boots in place better they usually break at the the hardware that connects or everything and what I'm showing you is one picture of a movie that washes Shore and there's other ones I have the same thing if you I don't know if you guys know anything about breaking but you can see there's a shackle that's in that picture you can see there's a stainless steel wire tied in the eye screws into the journal or the other chair well this requirement fraudulent orders tied that containing pain so it wasn't all the way in to the Shackled shoulder why would he why would you do something like that because if the buoy moves back and forth the chain causes a friction and deteriorates the throat especially with uh shoulders or threads okay which breaks loose now that quote shoulders always screwed in that would have never fail further there's a stainless steel eye on the building the carbon shot so the carbon is going to rust so and this is why movies fail and this is a deliberate fail I've reported these things at the app that we see care but some I I gave I gave numbers of pounds someone should go there for this contracts no this is like something like that in seawater it'll it'll chew that chat board a guess of going after working for him okay look at samples into work and think of bringing a sample going this is how we've got to go yeah we there's a best practice um that Katie and Knox uses as well that I took from them um it's all stainless steel Hardware it's it was specified when we get the quotes in my experience that the contractor we've used two times now has done what he was told to do I would say anything contrary to that but it's definitely something to be expected let's take the entire project like you said from first uh Harrison and put that into our currency budget so we can see basically it's more a thought process to see what it will do in the out years say free every uh two years we have to do a replacement and put that that number over there for us just to get a kind of a good feeling about what you can expect but I mean I agree with you look you're swimming you're going to drift and we did that to protect people so make sure we got the moving going all the way up we budgeted five thousand dollars a year wait I expect my command you want you to do this for our students is that really necessary you know what I'm saying because talking to FWC they don't really have 100 yard requirements they don't even have the requirement that you can bring your boat you can't bring the billions right afterwards okay but if the buoy is 100 yards pass it compared because it's enforced by the sheriff system so my whole thing was to The Weekend Warriors and technically I mean we've had people come here and say I'm going to move my voting Privileges and that if we spread them out just a little bit why can't we sell a department to our opponent's residents for five bucks they can't so they can bring the vote in presently as long as it's not an empowered motor based on the public being beliefs that you folks establish so if it's not under wind power and it's not a remote the boat isn't loud in the public reading books established that's what the award is is to be able to force that was kind of share okay so if we modify something by saying hey look you can bring the boat in because keep the buoys more than 100 yards apart it's the imaginary line it keeps the weekend warrior and the person people in Ballard Shores people about our future you have no good seed vacation [Music] you know we know we know who they're for and we know what uh what we're trying to do and it's just basically establish a line of don't come applying for a year I think whenever we discuss this for the north side the actual Bel Air age whenever we try to do spacing there were complaints about well why am I in a boat zone why am I not in a boat's own why you couldn't make everything happen uh what whatever it is we do we just need to make it the same and uniform all the way down and of course we need to see numbers and this is not something but the question is is the council want to entertain this idea and at least start doing the research some things that are involved is that they have to have permitting also and that does cost money and we will be required to pay for that permit um [Music] it's this time okay well I think as far as from a legal perspective that their attorney is with an active step up that can help this project to that extent what we will certainly need some kind of I would strongly advise that we have some kind of integral agreement that was the last that was the last thing and I know that was a source of global would seem to be modified and uh and this would be a good time to actually look at both of our interlocals and uh I think that this will be a Goodwill project it would probably help us to resolve some of the issues that we have with our our current access [Music] absolutely mayor you got my support I have some questions yeah sure so um this Bel Air Shores willing to put in place the same ordinance we have in place and that's what we need to discuss yeah so I can kind of say they do know that it would require an organized change they are aware of that and so that's where the city manager and the City attorney did their job [Music] and we'll give all the information to be transparent and see if they're really interested in allowing isolate it's a great deal for them but on the other hand we use their Beach way more than they use their future but could we because there's kind of a Viewpoint of they review our ordinance and aren't willing to put that in place can we ask them to review our ordinance and see if they we get the council agreement with that something because there's no point to spend a lot of time on this if they're not even willing to accept the ordinance as it's written or if it's something similar because we're going to need that for the permit and then when I heard Kyle say was it's about fifty two thousand dollars let's do this project and and Louie's last a year to maybe three years so is that a 52 000 a year ongoing maintenance projects and as that is we have a lot of deferred infrastructure that really is buying that money more than buoys for someone else's problem and that's why I'm bringing to the council and just some just things that are going as we're talking about it so just kind of that and then so I think before we even spend too much time thinking about budgeting it we probably should say are they going to be agreeable to the organ [Music] will be better person to present them to to their mission and they don't necessarily have good in their meeting but I guess start with their City attorney and pass it off to where they're located right see what she thinks and see if there's still an interesting I have a feeling that they don't vote to their age if I could be wrong there's a horizon here tonight if you brought that up I take the challenge me on that of whether they would actually go for it or not this is where it starts and I just before we even begin this I wanted to see if this was something interesting they're going to get into the start just asking the questions I do I have similar concern star vice mayor but if we can just look and see that's recommended uh Mr America do you wrote the final word on this topic I think Belarus absolutely I think one of them which could assignments good luck with that yeah [Music] hey said you did a great job when I heard the conversations yes sir I just have a couple more questions about the maintenance part of it so let's assume we did an entire project two years down the road we're talking about doing it again but as part of that still reusable I mean so I mean there's some out there that have been there how long certainly pour down to I mean four or five it's like a half okay um and those four or five are actually still in the ground where they were originally there um since we're doing to do marketers we have to pull out the old one so we have different signage on them right so it'll kind of be a test to see uh on which effort it takes to bring those free we'll leave out there sure so again so if we put the new ones in and we're two years down the road and we really have to change anything so some of them come loose and watch the shore we don't really have to buy and do it so just whatever fails will allowed to go into the shore I don't know maybe just one of these broke loose and for that effect it's the Acres I think it's the problem right over time they start burying themselves sure and they've been enough salt water for a while and it's not a great mix there so I don't think it's my point is it's probably not going to be let's say let's hit twenty seven thousand dollars initially I'm going to build a Shore area and assuming that the cost will remain the same I don't think it would stand twenty seven thousand dollars two years still going to reuse some of those things to get the fact they even came this they prepare the ones that break but in the regional system yeah yeah I want to check with an interlocks to see I think they do it well on an annual basis okay um but you wouldn't want to go like three years to be here installed and all of a sudden the rest are really yeah we can still budget for you know so that was sort of recovered but in years ago we didn't have to spend all that money would carry over you know I think just to make that assumption that it's going to be twenty seven thousand dollars maybe two years every year just remembered Shores I'm not sure it's going to be that much I hope clothing eight inch time that's that's the cheaper way to go like devices through the code if there's a way to mark it out um to refined and connection points so over time that the market away is it's more expensive because you're not just dumping an acre into the water you're paying the Irish actually found in there but maybe if it's something that we're planning on maintaining your longer stretch it does make more sense you're really relocated by the third order has far out okay for sure yeah I just got the permit for the markers but I can reach back out and see if it's an option I just I didn't know if you had someone we have a piles on this side yeah something like this let's begin with the permanent report even interested at all foreign [Music] [Music] it's a shame on me but I did have a couple of conversations with Mr Moore I wanted to just run some ideas past them regarding some of his experiences with other cities that he works with how they handle it things like that so I got some good feedback from him but I think Mr Spirit we can just kind of get a feeling for how everybody else feels about doing this and then I've got some different ideas as to how we may proceed if it looks like everybody's in favor of that material I think it would be a long position for our leaders let me know where you stand this Livingstone I'm in agreement I think it's a welcome addition surely I think it's a great idea I'm disappointed when I've heard these before I used to term implications the indication is a summary um whether you use God Jesus Christ which frankly not everybody believes religions be personally the reason for the United States is because the government practice religion they have a state sponsored correction and frankly I spent a year in my wrath where the government six times a day broadcast it called prayer which followed in that was gunshots and frankly there are over thousands of churches around here but there's one in one city hall that City Hall should be for everybody not just evangelists you know Jews for example they don't read the New Testament no just verse 5. they don't use the term God Jesus Christ is not a savior um in fact you can't use the word god it's Hashem G Etc what I'm telling you is we just got through three years of hell of people arguing enemies some have breached the lines and we've reached across and some of that but frankly I don't want to have an indication that I don't need it and I'm moving to table very much Mr Baker well um I'm 100 in favor uh in our on our money and says to God We Trust beginning of the constitute or when you're performing the Constitution it was in a year [Music] okay and I was actually saying a prayer and you can't wait to decide whether to become a powerful so um thank you I am also behind this in fact I'm I'm like vice mayor Shirley what are you going to say something I I did an informal survey with some of the residents city of Miller Beach and they were for it but afraid of it and the reason why they were afraid of it was only because they were afraid we would be safe and so what I did was I was in a 10-minute search on the internet and it looks like the Supreme Court will back us up because it's considered consider speech I have been called on by the mayor's Council of Pinellas County twice to do the invocation and I was very proud and honored to do it but I've also had to watch others here and not everyone who believes the same thing that I do and I respect everyone and their position of where they stand religion wise and uh I think most people that do the invocation are going to be smart enough to make it as generic as possible where you still there's some spirituality involved but you're not trying to be offensive to others who I think ultimately it's it has the uh the same outcome and it's a great way to start a meeting so I am 100 behind this excellent um again I did have some discussions with Mr Mora and he assured me that he's been involved with other cities uh that do this so a couple of what you said about going online taking a look at things I don't see any any issues I did look online as well for some for lack of a better word that that's him which really brings the question who do we want to be and I didn't say communication I just saved her um who do we want to be involved in actually open to meetings with a prayer and again with my conversation with Mr Moore he I would bring up some different ideas he would explain to me um these dogs and what I was potentially recommending it seemed like the best thing for our city because there are some cities as an example that made me have 15 churches in their city so they will invite ministers from the various churches so at the end of the day I felt like the best thing for us to pursue would be the council members who wanted to participate would actually say the prayer now one thought that I had was there's there is a prayer templates available out there and they're designed specifically for cities and counties and organizations like that so they're very careful and I I do not want to water it down um based on my beliefs at the same time I don't want to cross any lines and cause people to feel so what I'd like to suggest if it's okay with all of us here is to put together a template as to the prayer that would be used at our meetings with all of us knowing that you know this would just be a template if there's certain things that are going on in the world or certain things that are going on our city that we believe or the person who's reading that night feels like it will be appropriate to have something else to it I think we should allow them anything but I could put this simple together and and work with Brandy to make sure he thinks it's fine and then with that document I could give that to everybody else out there to take a look at it and see what everybody's thoughts are and how so how do you guys feel about that where anybody who wanted to we would just have a schedule that said this month's meeting council member X will be appreciate your people saying prayer everyone except that there's new yeah and there would be some new way in there I just think it's a it's a structure to follow a lot of it is pretty much common sense but we're asking for guidance and strength you know they help our city the exactly the thing second of all your roster says in me if I decide not to participate in fact talking like discipline an advantage people are starting to think oh my God is against God I said look I do it again speaking personal if you want to get into all of them to even talk about that but again it also requested in the table list you didn't pass my emotion um it's deeply divisive and you're starting to see Temperance again you can go to church Jesus Christ God yes forever God in fact we say that during the Pledge of Allegiance obviously however they don't mandate a religion which you're doing by saying in Jesus Christ's name or you know in God's name what about Allah I mean playing those Advocate again look there's a lot of problems there and I'm just telling you from my standpoint as a member of this Council I don't need God's permission to do anything if you're an engineer we fire Engineers they think God's gonna happen no numbers he said yes or no and again I want a table this motion okay we have a I'm sorry I did not hear you say take up early no no no however with no motion on the table would anyone like a second it's my conversations all right the motion dies so please continue Mr Taylor no uh no it's a process so that's why I understand thank you um going back to the mayor's Council of Pinellas County whenever they ask me they said do your own or if you'd like we can provide you with one I will be more than happy to email tomorrow to get a copy okay can I just add I travel to stay fully permits in front of Maine cities municipalities typically requires a land use change zoning I'm in front of capsules in many many cities and I think ours is the only city I've been in front of that does not have some sort of Prayer but there's also many that you know I've been to both yeah whenever I do a big city meeting mayor's Council meetings we do I also noticed that Pinellas County County the little all over the map but I had felt bad that we that I could at least feel better prepared at the beginning of the meeting and I even though council member is able doesn't really agree I think that it sets the tone and kind of calms everybody down to be prepared for a good meeting knock on wood this is a great Council very proud of all of you and I hope that this doesn't damage damage our future but I do feel very strongly about it and I thank you very much and I'm just going to back up on that is look I respect the council house you know whatever they do are behind you foreign [Music] kind of like what you said used to Mary darling when you were asked they said you could get your own or you could use one that they had in place and I think the reason why they gave you that option is because you know writing down their thoughts and things I've never seen it I may have heard it but I wouldn't know prepared one or someone wrote it but I'll get it and take a look at it and you guys work on something and let's talk about it it doesn't require anything about it in our chart says we can We'll be asking because myself well I'm going to hand off the contact you know right the the and invocation and then you can look at whatever you want to that's just an example thank you any other discussion um this is discussion of holiday Lighting on gold Boulevard knowing that the Valor Beach Community Foundation had big plans to try to fund some of this however I was afraid that because they're in the organization they probably wouldn't be able to do it for at least a couple of years because it takes time to build up the kitty and uh I've also had several residents during the holiday season and said everyone else has lights and we look like a bunch of scroogees why don't we have lights here and uh and so I assured everyone that they preached out to me that I would put it on the work session so here we are and Kyle would you like to give an update on our situation okay so I put together a map just kind of show where we're at about three months ago my staff went out and um located all the polls that had existing outlets on them and uh determined which ones actually didn't um six then I started discussions with Duke Energy you know telling them okay this is what we have what I asked them what it would cost me to prepare the ones that don't have power to them anymore so it nice so you know in that job or like it should be all complete within a week and then um so what this map shows is all the green is the existing elements that that was still there that they didn't know um I do not know it was a guy I can imagine there was an outlet mystery maybe now it's definitely a 12th Street 16th Street um I don't know if at the time that wear and tear that separated um is no longer there but I reached back out I'm trying to get a price for what I'm very charging Foods because the way I lay this map out the bare minimum if we just kept the pattern equivalent to release 25th but I think that there's a lot of parts of the Northwest City that could kind of would be a big gap I mean you could set up there I try to draw what would be ideal based on what the like holes where the best spacing to sort of maintain the uniform heard this plan if you think is acceptable an additional 17 proposal that's again I need to know what would you have energy of what they're going to cost after the other big question is um and that that was my fear is that we would do all this planning and work and then they would put their things down yeah and the way they Duke is um foreign you know they're all departmentalized so she has the intentional planning department um I've imagined it on assume that they wouldn't fix it on these Outlets that they're going around once but I still look for the exactly the action of that so I'm going to make sure what was the last part so they they took out themselves to apparently's outlets that didn't have power but I just was asking you know what it would take I would not saying we're going to use any holiday decorations this year or anytime in the near future so um I want to assume which I probably shouldn't have but then they wouldn't go repair something and they were going to group down in a matter of months right but I get into the answer for that to what's the goal with a straight line we're just going to leave it as is and right now the plan of the underground all the players they're going to top the poles and put caps on them you're going to have the existing wood poles to go into account with me right now I think it is a it was probably only nine holes that were going to go away and the rest of wooden balls with the lights staying on top so they're shorter there's like discussion and pricing on solar the problem the solar is the arms on number comes along so you're going to have to put the solar lights on closer to the roadway um Plus currently right now we do all the solar Arrangements in the city and maintaining solar lighting on both polarizes have we asked to find out we'll get on another subject but for the cost to replace those light poles with concrete poles or metal poles as part of our Student Life Plan and what that might look like it is um I was to add a gag reports that we didn't exist as seven thousand I think I'd take a price that it was for 4 000. hopefully we wouldn't existed in one week so it's still you know what that lease looks like to I mean just just food for thought let's let's kind of look at like some options on streamline plans or after underground what that looks like because that's exactly where I was going I don't want to invest all this money to do Christmas decorations for two years and then we rip it all out and have to redo it and so having 19 holes we end up with I don't know ten yeah I I'm definitely all for a modern relationship but also those decorations are not cheap they were buried at any price time they priced through above 500 to a thousand dollars so with the with the number we're looking at if we kept what we have existing looking at about 20 000 we'll be at as many to scan the city we're looking at about 36. the lady there later Ally and then hopefully this week as all day and plug screen for the new higher meeting services okay well um I guess what we need is more information electricity but if it's just temporary and we decide to change things out we in a future work session I think we should we should decide and discuss or discuss and decide whether so in some polls just too bad Mills County you still ask Ed that yeah all right um again this was just uh it's not really an action I don't know if it's just a discussion but um and say hey we're talking about it and we're still trying to work out a plan all right next up council member staple foot uh let's see converting to park mobile or another mobile parking app uh takeaway uh we looked at parking and uh we're fine you know my preliminary thought was can we save money by removing all these signs because I was saying okay assignments we've replacing we have maintenance of the parking meters uh with something park over which actually cities to our left in a right Inland youth parking lot and it's very easy because frankly all the accountants now removed from in-house to an external agency that does all the accounting for you when people are used to it they know how to use it the police force our sheriffs they know how to use it and going through the numbers they're fairly conservative you know there is some animal Savings in this good part role though there is additional savings with another company but the one thing that stuck out was the cost to maintain the parking meters that's signed by our city manager um I think you're talking five hours a month minimum to maintain repair and the problem comes in we don't have a repair for it you got to trace it down look the object is we hire them he's doing a great job but he needs to get out of the job of parking maintenance yeah and that's why I brought this up we talked to well two companies and the numbers so far they they work out to again if no savings there's a minimal savings or it could be more from going to these companies with that idea but the big savings comes in no longer having to maintain the parking machines Kyle what was your thought because like I said we went back forward on this you'll see some of the emails so yeah if you look at um our costs of particular maintenance and if you'll get the actual sres the the actual for last for 20 to 21 like a year was 16 283. what was that made up that number that was subscription fees Parts upgrades for the meters periodically they upgrade the networks that they're going on so we have the freedom open [Music] the time um but with the Parts Program it's beneficial because you're recycling Parts but it still involves the time every time something for any because you have to troubleshoot it you have people put one data in the other then you have to drive the point of view it's all about which is [Music] a 49 series response at 16 000 degree inspiration that's the cost of the maintenance fees as I'm putting the time that was 2021 and was that the mode of year I guess and if we buy the modes we did yeah so I don't expect that to happen again just curious 21 to 22 was fifteen thousand nine twenty four I can break these down but we're not budgeting enough and how much are we bringing in um how many hours what I'm saying is when I'm looking at it in the course of 68 cents an hour of course you know yeah briefly of the books we did was it does it's very innocent at all but you're also paid for credit cards to somebody else but here's the thing is Mira talked earlier it was a really good point sometimes we don't want the people at first and what you do I don't know these are outside inside you got your parking pass you're good you're free to park anywhere you want but obviously no matter what it was but for these outside people you can at the touch of abundance to change the race you can increase rates for holidays you can back them up a little bit for a weekend you can basically afford to charge the outside people more and it's a these places in that composition do you want a hurricane do you want to go to the beach okay well it's going to cost you X for the parking um but again going back to the biggest Saver in all of this is Kyle's time and we all agree that we value his time in the stamps time and that's one less thing that we get removed which is an immediate savings and still provide parking and maintain the income that we've been basically on a bank now no matter what service we choose whether we stay with the we were with now or if we move forward with our mobile I would not expect this right now the city manager right they have to be responsible for this I agree [Music] so we can go ahead and dig you know more into that and then work the companies and going okay here's our typical thing what are you coming forward and is there a competitive offer so you can really do see the numbers involved and that's really the the critical decision point so you can see okay are we going to lose money are we going to stay even you know perhaps be more High driving my preliminary diversity that they look for them but you've got to really get them in here and what's really nice is at least two days ago we know one agency already has the contract for the area so it's just a matter of time on to Clearwater's contract uh to go forward and frankly their infrastructure just the signs but they pay for the science the uh the initial setup it's again we're starting to look at this that this would be a good price is going forward any would like to speak on this topic well you take the 145 000 employees and divide it by five dollars an hour and it takes 16 68 cents it's going to cost us 19 000 19 700. 16 000 now and with probably spending about fifteen hundred to two thousand away so you're going to be sure you're sure it's going to cost this product why is we are also charging credit cards that's where really the fee is with particle Bill and Ryan I had an old managed since now so I'm gonna cry yeah let me give you a little history and then I will continue to call on everyone vice mayor Shirley probably remembers this one of the things that we are able to accomplish with our Majors is that we put a cap on how much time someone can be on the beach okay all right so all right so uh if you're if you switched Apart Mobile you can't do that yes you can't go so it just won't let them it won't let them renew it gives you a match yeah there are Park mobile jurisdiction and jurisdiction you can vary even the concerns within a jurisdiction some just some zones you can't renew some all of them have a cap for example as they come through Clearwater down Myrtle the main roadway if you're parking for eight minutes or less it's no charge then it's an hour minimum after that and you can only park I think on something like three hours or something four hours so you do have the ability with that contractor to invisibility if we did this this would be the only one that I would even consider because it's already on my phone here [Music] [Music] disagree with parking app at Miller Beach Marina but I don't I don't mistake why anyway other comments it seems like I'm ain't barking in places that we have or I mean this building based out of our performance it's all part of the space available at all the locations suddenly maybe more um if you're out here's maybe 15 16. and this is children and it's a real convenient act here he's like yeah other cities I don't know if it's a good feeling it seems like you know I get clear water I can't even imagine how many spaces they have with people pay we're just we're just not as small so how long have we had those machines first one this person will face out of the theater one um he said it was the marina the newest one is here and that was in 2018 was awesome so I had all this one's got to be probably like oh six you may not get up and put money back in the machine and chances of being particularly recruits whereas if you have the app and you better notice that your time zone I think will collect more money because of the convenience through a mobile app you tend to over buy two because you can you can't get the refund put in four hours they haven't paid for four hours purchasing machines but I think what's the only thing that we're really missing here is the math right okay and yeah this is that's why you want to start I don't have a problem with uh with taking a serious look at this listen to their presentation and looking at the Hard numbers and seeing if it's actually worthwhile though I mean the idea was I'm not going to go back to me now so now we're going to see two hours three hours if you know what I'm saying because you can't do with time with time because really you know wants I know you don't want to say it was agreement with you in the whole entire city but still people from being threshold activities of Economics yeah and say oh well this guy because we know I mean it's taxing our staff and at least everything is always taxed on those very trying weekends and the sheriff knows how to work with himself you're the one who deals with it more than anything major objections of shooting not a lot of the actions well that we're eliminated right having that they either have to have them pay for it or they don't you have to download the app I've been stuck in that situation and I'm like okay I've got this app and I forgot the password and I'm trying to set up yeah but then you uh and then you register your husband's truck right instead of your car yeah there's one other thing yeah what are the thoughts I don't like having a lot of cash here and that's where we're at right now we're right into the back and we start talking pushing 100 000 through and you're pushing a lot of that in cash back there advice here no cash nobody's attempted no accounting your comment was whether I can't change this back I mean we have an older community but most you know this in this area I didn't know um is [Music] education and so what I'm saying is you have to give a cash options I'm not there's been as much as the question is the legal one I'm not I'm not aware of that as a requirement per se in all governments well I'm just functioning what it says no I understand I understand that it says this is familiar with the same provision I can also identify numerous governmental functions in which you are unable to pay with cash or coins and so I'm not that were that the case it'd be hard for me to conceive that it's that omnipresent at this age um part and even because some government facilities are came and the like I'm happy to look into it but I've not heard anything about a fact or seeing some judicial opinion that binds all governments who require the acceptance of cash for all forms of IRS formalities if that was your case and the city of Saint Pete the city of Clearwater Washington DC everyone it would be uh if everybody's okay uh say we had to move forward provide us with some real numbers and we have a little more discussion and bring somebody in okay okay is 20 till nine this one may take a while have gone down this road before okay briefly there's a waiting list for Marines and there's two types of people there's a resident and he's actual president and resident and non-resident owners and basically everybody else I mean it was in Clearwater wants to park their boat here and currently if you're on the list if you do not have a boat that matches that size say and I'm just going to use a quick example I've got a 20-foot boat and it's a 40 foot slip well if you don't qualify so close to the next person I just want to change that to give that person an option much as you not required aluminum boat right now when you request it I want the same option to apply it to somebody in the city going if I have a 20-footer and I'm next on the list please contact me and give me the option to either accept it and buy a bigger boat you got no choice you can't park that 24th you've got to use what we have accepted by that bigger boat and I'll have that bigger boat parked in you know three months I'm going to go get a sale or say I'm not getting a bigger boat therefore I can't accept the slots he goes to the next person on the list you know next um okay I'm going to say Beller of each person but it gives them the option to upsize their next on the list I'm just trying to you know hit that because in some cases we're seeing that a person in Bellaire Beach resident has a 20-footer and because they don't need the big 40-foot that they're passed over would not be another fine we just I want to give them a shot to upgrade the boat and take that swap like can I asked how many people are on the waitlist right now yeah I mean this was brought up to maybe a a resident that was passed over and he said well if under no I would have bought a bigger vote which is from 84. um 29 uh the way the weight does work currently is you just have to own property to be on the top part of the list of to be considered first they have 29 quality hours 5500 each and the way that the ranking goes currently is you get ranked highest to figure out if the boat you plan to put in that slip is the longest so if if you have a 33 foot boat it's say number two of the list by another property owners on our beach comes has a 38 footload they want to put in they're going to jump you on the list so I guess to Mike's Point why don't we offer to the next guy on the list and say this is the cost for the slope I don't care how big this is you know if it's a 55 foot slip and we charge a dollar a foot it's 55 you know whatever Simplicity uh that's the price for the slip I don't care how big it looks the Liberty factor of the solicit of the department game just so most you know everything has a lot of room behind it so you my foot um as long as you're if you have us narrower sample and long it's hard to say exactly what the maximum is for that sliver because the maximum is limited by the way okay but you were just saying a 33-foot boat so I was just doing a good you know a good comparison if there's a slip for a 33 foot boat and I'm on the list next with a 20-foot boat okay you can call me and say this is the price to rent this slip are you interested or not and that's based on what that slip will allow not based on my book so you're saying they we find the boat the biggest clothes that could fit in that slippery program that's personal beliefs that's not Jody and she's got a 20-foot little Runabout right right and there's a 40-foot slope Jody here's the price not this one doesn't divide by the lane Thurston and the thing is Big okay but let's apply that after this slip number 10 can accommodate that 30 to a 40-foot boat we put a price tag on that slip whatever that is I mean maybe we need to look at that pricing for those people that are waiting and ask the slip to turn you know clearly people that are endless spots already they have their price they're they've worked into that schedule we did a few years ago and you know they're in place but anyone knew but trying to accommodate our property owners if we have how many slips do we have they're rented by non-property owners do you have any so so resident property owners are not in such an interest non-resident property owners six literature and then non-profer dealers number three okay so those three probably should get a notice that they have six months to move their vote so we can accommodate our property at those rates at whatever rate schedule we set up but I mean the marinas for our residents not informed but as much as I love it being a profit center it's only for a residents not for non-residents so is the fee based on the length of the boat that are Bank based on the language of the length of those right foot slip and have a 20-foot oh we're only charging them for the 25 bucks correct let's well currently there's a minimum the fee schedules laid out in the last production they're terrified for their 40th right they would be paying enough based on the the footage correct in the states have you clarify what you're saying are you saying that we should be charging one set breaks before the slip though well I just don't want us to pass over a resident this time so that might be a complicated we've got someone in the audience you would have a what we consider a minimum Max on the footage for that slip so let's say it accommodates 25 to 35 people 20 feet well you get the minimum today but you're paying for five extra eight if you want and what happens typically I rent a slip and I go live and I put it in there so that may be that being maybe allows a name under 14 foot you know beam or something ridiculous I've been sizing down to accommodate my my boat what's the same Theory as a single person buying a four thousand feet square you're paying the taxes right whatever it is yeah it never is so it means that slip can accommodate it's a matter of seconds at least in the middle employees I agree that we should charge a length of this regardless of what you as your boat owners are put in there that's not my problem right you want to put a tiny little button there no Auburn I'm running with you I need to wear a little it's not like this but I this was what I did yeah I mean I'm with you yeah when she'd be everything we can to accommodate The Residency at least our residents are getting voted yeah I don't know if you want to address the council just come on a yeah ladies I um the reason for this coming up on on the agenda I'm Jonathan myola 107 First Street everybody's been very helpful and I appreciate it thank you um I came from a neighborhood so I bought a house here 10 years ago 11 years ago didn't realize Kyle's been great he let me know that I could have been on that list 10 years ago but I don't consider myself a resident even though I bought the home so now I move in a year and a half ago I said okay now now I can get on the list to find out I'm at number 16 let's say well this year not trying to get anybody in trouble here but I moved down from 16th to 24th on the list because people had bigger boats than I did not knowing that I just went to the Tampa Boat Show I'll buy 35-foot Pope if I can have a slip to put it in my boat's 24 feet right now so I'm a resident willing to take any slip pay any money to get in that slip for convenience however I get you've got I understand from other neighbors there's been a lot of time toward into this subject so rather than reinvent the wheel I came from a neighborhood that had 40 slips and 40 homes and the neighbors worked very well together in shuffling it was sort of first and last out type of deal and we had the exact issue that you're talking about where some slips were larger than others some people came in they were new homeowners they had bigger boats than people that had smaller boats and we worked it all out by the first and last out and what happened this was very complicated and I don't suggest this but we had a review every year that basically said if you want to move your slip these people are moving out of the neighborhood the new people come in they get last choice and that's just how all this work and it works very well and everybody knew that a year from now they're both fit their slip but if the bigger slip came open they got they were next in line the same same Theory and I'm not trying to get complicated here but you shouldn't be able to go backwards on the wait list it's lasted you know last out first in same way a waitlist always works the issue is when it's my turn if I don't want to take that slip or can't afford that split then I'm happy to pass it on to the number two person but if I'm next in line and a guy comes in from wherever and has a 40-foot pole but he shouldn't be able to jump me in line and that makes no sense so that's sorry to make it more complicated I hope it didn't confuse you even more about it you know I actually think it's perfect since thank you very much Mr speaker thank you for taking the time if I just throw a couple thoughts I feel for him I really do and I I think if I could just put this out there one man's low-sized fees the discussions on the marina we can do this every couple of years I I like it coming up right now as you're doing the comprehensive plan and start looking at really incrementally do we just want to make another decision now or do we have a big city plan with what we want to do with them first secondly I really said if you just took a blank slate down there that's where you get the decision of where do we do what we've always done with my foot and we really look at it reconfigure it and charge by the size of a slip unfortunately you have people down there so you're kind of caught in that middle ground this piece I don't think is fair so there's something that has to be done that allows the list to prioritize maybe even resonance which goes back to the comprehensive and talk should we have a marina that's not even for outside and phase that out should we limit number of boats or slopes you could have should we talk about maybe the slip sizes again it's really an interesting subject but it starts with a little pain and so I was watching themselves go from 16 to 24. I know I waited seven years I didn't look backwards on the list I know that for a fact so I don't think you're always welcome to ask me questions about competitive pricing what have you but I think children would be Thanksgiving thank you I mean here he's been in a resident for 10 years I really think she's looking at somebody it's invested in this community for 10 years or five years or 20 years of advice about somebody just moves in here watching being on one of the list you know what I'm saying he should get some grandfather because that's what I'm trying to do yeah just rewriting this but I mean the device and there's definitely some problems it's hard to ask someone to leave you told them hey you can keep your boat here even though they're uh maybe not a resident but they are certain things that I've always felt very strongly about but we should look at that lady I think the non-resident should be the absolute Last Resort for whatever I say resident I don't mean rental home orders I don't mean the people that invest in property and they don't and they live over in Tampa I'm talking about people that live here in Bel Air Base and that's what's on their driver's license they should they should first priority and they should always be at the top of the list and the only reason why anyone not living here should be in that Marina at all is because it's nobody wants it but uh also I have a problem with uh if we more than one but more than 150 you have more than one boat well one's already that's the only spot you can get is I think we have that case right now it's a very different same household and neither lives here is that right that's going on with the exactly in the background okay thanks well what did I really don't buy a boat so it's not enough yeah well my point is is that uh if we had a first stance on you must live here that would happen yes obviously there's some discussion that's that's going to be happening with the long-term strategy for our city and I I look forward to their recommendations and then we can put our own spin on it and maybe come up with something that um will accommodate the residents and not make them wait so unfortunately you have it's cold and it's hard to do this Shuffle around whenever it's time to make rule changes we just watched the Clearwater Yacht Club all new dogs all new slips and everything's brand new there and it was an absolute nightmare for all those because because they had to find homes to put their docks in you know private private docks they were hanging their neighbors and their friends for just let me keep my boat here for a few months and I think some of them are still not there because they're still working on Power and things like that it's not easy and will be the most popular person if we go changing what we already have but I think it's something that definitely we need to continue thinking about talking about until we have a workable solution that we're all happy with and like Mr Baker says we're putting the Residence at the top of the list so sorry that happened but uh yeah I'm recommended bill in the meantime because I mean we've had a great kind of solely which is good analyze review can we rapidly change it so that the existing people don't get jumped if we change it can he get back to 16 instead of 24. you know I'm just saying that's what we should be looking at yeah it's because it's this section right here about how to applying stuff that we just change that now obviously everything else is long stupid and it will work on a comprehensive line but but for now I'll be just addressing the Landscaping part and I like you know advice Bears idea where you say no you're not required to buying a boat you're required to pay attention absolutely and then if you don't well the wife says no her husband and I just had a couple of things I guess so we can move forward because we don't have any information right okay so yeah can we get some actual numbers of current doc situations and then also what the waiting list looks like and I think from what just said we've got three residents that are free renters that are not property owners in the city and at least we can talk about that maybe handle those three to the Forefront and anyone that's a non-resident should even bother with them on a waitlist what's the point get rid of the non-proper young or non-resident work list just have the property owner Beller Beach residence on that way because period there's no need to shuffle them around and have them on a weightless that they're never going to get a spot menu um and then we once we start accumulating the information you can start talking about dock prices and that sort of thing I don't believe this is something comprehensive the comprehensive plan will cover they they're talking about zoning and things like that I mean clearly they don't get involved with this stock prices correct there is a future vision of what the marina is about and saying that it'll uh camera with the exact Portage you remember saying it would keep the uh I don't remember the verbiage that there was a I mean there was a Planning and Zoning meeting where they've begun the process of workshopping comp plan amendments a comp plan as a constitution for Land Development and you start with policies and objectives in your comp plan policies and objectives like recreational elements like the city remains committed to preserving the residential character of its and preserving all Parks and Recreation Department and so there was some discussion about um within the Planning and Zoning Board of inserting language to a policy to strongly favor the permanent retention of that Marina and had a policy that the city intends to and remains interested in maintaining a marina for the use of its natural resources by its rest dot dot dot something along those lines the general concern being that some future commission or body may look to just say you know we could turn that into a Starbucks or something and eliminate this this Marina and have it be a comp plan element thank you so it's just a broad statement it doesn't policies and objectives for All Season objectives decision making where our compliance and our stolen water you know cost to repair a stormwater was a few thousand dollars and it wasn't it was 300 000 or 3 million or whatever it was a section that it would focused on so it was a very broad statement details which is what I'm going to assume because yeah so I think what they're considering or finding something is if they want to get more details about more of a vision for that property so again you'll be the one driving that because we can't participate in those meetings okay so uh do we have any action items on this one again at this time one person could participate president [Music] I don't know I took a step at this and um there were people that were friends with the outside Runners and it was just a lot going on and uh I mean I did need it all to Kyle it's just something very very high level Grant and I wouldn't be working or not and it was kind of a starting point I would have a problem continuing on it and working if we went and just just making some suggestions as a draft and just talk about it I'd like to realize mine to basically Echo the price mirrors said so like I said that in 2012. okay so there's a couple of things in and uh look at that we have a general business I was just thinking if we were talking in the immediate um if you guys could I mean you kind of said um that you want to be able to the presidents that live here against the top also said that um you thought it was Fair more so in the order that they got on the list determine their rank so there are there are adjustments I don't know how to do some validation of the people who burn the property owners and out of the list and determine who the president is not but there are some immediate adjustments that I can make um because I do have holidays they got off the list like I'm just saying in the media future so that we do [Music] I would like to establish a time limit as to the clock starts taking and we can work I think we know there's more slips that will eventually distinguish between property owners and residents because some of them say you know somebody lives almost to Tampa but they rent their place out here are they a property owner or is it a person who runs their house here come ahead or are they on the same I thought maybe the mayor brought that up yeah the renter I had someone who is here in Bel Air because it would not be treated any different than someone lives here in homes for all they've done I don't know how about the guy who owns the places Richard is renting [Music] I don't think that they should be they should take priority just because they own the rental homes condos [Music] Asia and then it makes me questioned who do we treat the ranger who may only be having your Beast different than the owner and that's it looks like if they actually made it through the list I just always have to slip again but I would never follow it there are I'm sure there's people here that have read it for years and they just continue to live here in Bel Air Beach and they made you know paid property taxes but they do everything else and they contribute to our society it shouldn't the people that live here and own here and pay the taxes and bought the house and like like I should be ahead of the guy that either lives here and rents or owns a house here and rests to someone else or I mean I pay the most money to be here shouldn't I get a priority absolutely absolutely thank you is there any way you can manipulate this thing and get him back there somewhere anybody else and what I want to do is go through the 29 about who lives here owns the place distinguished point of that in November right we're a general business thank you"
