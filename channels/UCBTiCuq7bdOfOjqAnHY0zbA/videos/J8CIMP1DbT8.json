correct thank you any other comments well thank you report good evening City Council Members staff citizens Stephen for the record in my monthly code report again we are still doing some investigations as far as permits and unlicensed people doing work within the city a lot of them we have a uh we've been doing a lot with the cleanup around the city our major one which we've been working on for about a year is on 17th street where the house was sold and the home was cleaned up and now they're just waiting for a permit to do some work in there the other thing that we're doing is we're focusing on since hurricane season started uh with some of the docks within the city limits if I'm not a mistake we already got three letters going out and another three four uh to get the homeowners to repair their docks one that I'm very happy to say it was on Elita that has been going on since December 21st so when you see my report next month you'll see that they finally got a crew out there and they're replacing the dock so other than that I'll stand for any questions any question yeah excited down here uh unpainted worn out paint on a house what about um citizens that say have pressure treated number of country um you know attach the front of the house or on the side of the house uh is sort of one in particular um not right now I'm just say it's a task and rain at this point well again we'll look at that I'll get with the city manager manager and also over there into you know assess that but yeah if it's if the woods collected or normal or whatever then yes we can we can take care of that okay thanks [Music] I have a question regarding the docs how are we um monitoring them how many views in the sheriff's closed down yes we are um I'm trying to go out at least once a month with them and again it's it's scheduled to change uh this Sunday I'm going to try to go out again because I'll be back on Sunday and I'm going to go with one of the Marine units and just again start looking at some of these areas not only with the Docks but seeing if there's any other unscheduled work that's being done with some of these homes this may be really not be a question pretty much if someone pulls a dollar permit how long do they have to recruit the project and that stands for like full performance so we seem to be open for I believe it's one year if I'm not mistaken the problem that they're having is getting these companies come in and do the work um because there's not a lot of Doc companies that people are using out here and the issue is getting somebody to come out give you an estimate and then find it out like we had the one on the week that we found out they weren't even licensed in this County so they had to get their license you know all together before they do that so it's it's from the time they pull the program I believe they have one year to get the work done yes oh thank you you're very welcome also just to add that it doesn't leave the homeowner of a real responsibility so if the doc's under repair we have a storm come through you know the homeowners are still responsibility [Music] so you know again it could be right here okay all right thank you have a good evening any citizens comments questions okay thank you all right it's uh item four is the presentation of Noah Sun Coast Fire Rescue thank you good evening let me council members Jeffrey Davidson fire team from Suncoast [Music] this Thursday uh Jimmy City Hall [Music] we all right hosting a hurricane and water safety Expo right here and it's going to be from 1 to 6 pm will be vendors there's going to be a life Jackie giveaway Beach and voting safety information it'll be a free barbecue it will also be a blood drive I'm gonna leave if you donate blood you get a 20 gift card and a T-shirt and a wellness checked up and all kinds of things it's going to be a good day good informational session and we expect anticipating hundreds of people to be here throughout the communities you know it's co-sponsored with families as well as Indian Rocks Beach so that's going to be a good thing we'll look forward to seeing you there did you say it was wonderful it's from one to six weeks okay thank you [Music] I want to explain to the council and the citizens the EMS services that I have been pursuing for your city and providing nothing on the EMS enhancement that I requested to the county as its budget season to add an additional EMS unit service [Music] tomorrow there you go okay let's try it again thank you can you printed a pile of this one though I set it up it's good foreign update on the EMS enhancement that I requested which was to add an additional EMS unit to service Bellaire Beach ballet Shore in the Northern and Indian Rocks Beach so since 2009 the county identified a response time Gap and that is mainly because there is a 5.6 mile gap between Fire Station 27 the mini Rocks Beach and fire station 44 in Clearwater we cannot meet the county response I think which means which means you are not getting the services they don't deserve the fire department has taken steps to build another fire station that the fire department is paying for with our revenues which will be in the very Northern end of any Rocks Beach and will be one and a half minute drive time to this location it's going to solve the historical problems that we've had um the only thing I was asking the county is to fund the paramedics for the union which is what they do I mean every resident throughout the county pays 0.8875 Mills to the County EMS fund and that goes to funds paramedics so the fire department is the First Responders they fund one paramedic per fire truck and the amount of money that has been paid up this is kind of shocking so when I looked at it I put in for this because there's a response time Gap the solution is adding another truck adding another unit into a station closer to Bellaire Beach and again we're paying for the states and we're asking the county to pay for the Personnel that request was not even considered it was not given to the accounting Commissioners it was unilaterally decided for whatever reason I've asked three times three weeks in a row for an explanation as to how they these members uh on their own we came up with this decision to not put it in the council uh the commission member's hands and I'm still waiting on that response so with the 0.8875 males at every single resident page this area Bellaire Beach barely short Indian Rocks Beach is funded for one unit that's engine 27. okay those same areas the other piece really sure any Rocks Beach those residents in 2022 paid 2 million 43 506 dollars into the EMS fund and we were only funded 689 000 to provide those services okay not even one-third of what the citizens paid and there's an identified Gap that needs to be addressed I can tell you 100 I can show you we've had calls like Cardiac Arrest where we cannot get an ambulance for 40 minutes and that's absolutely unacceptable not in anybody's book especially mine Bel Air beats alone paid not to the fire department to the County EMS fund Belair Heats alone paid one million 360 000 375 last year and you're not getting the services that that you deserve according to twinellas County 2023 adopted annual operating capital budget the County EMS fund has approximately 66 million dollars in reserves and is projected to have 83.6 million dollars in reserves in fiscal year 2018. almost 40 percent 39.8 Reserves 83.6 million dollars and we're asking for one million dollars to fund two paramedics for an ALS transport unit that is desperately needed for this area your residents are paying account EMS taxi are not being funded again the residents of this area were funded for one unit have paid in over 2 million dollars and we were only funded 689 thousand dollars the County EMS response time compliance is 7 minutes and 30 seconds 90 of the time and I can tell you from EMS to this area is only meeting at 80.61 of the time when you come to all calls not just EMS it's in the 70s trying to fix that okay so a request was made for funding to staff and transport people Rescue Unit into paramedics to provide the EMS services that are needed into your city and this request was not moved forward by the mess Authority it was not given to the board of County Commissioners I've asked three times for a written explanation as to why this demonstrated deed was not considered and I still not received an unanswered so I ain't urging you it's budget season I am urging you please contact your County Administration as to why this request was not considered to be moved to the board of County Commissioners your citizens deserve it there's a gap in the system it's been identified for since 2009 however many years that is a lot and this is the solution and the money's there so why is it not happening this is what I'm facing and I need your help thank you if you have any questions I'd love to answer them for you so so citizens understand work against them [Music] um you know I I left some of these uh on the table over there but I'll bring them up I have six copies for you this email addresses of the commissioner so you got to look them up but this is this is not you know I'm passionate about this this is what I do for a living I've been doing this for 35 years and and this is no joke if to see where we can't even get an ambulance that time 40 minutes to a cardiac arrest you're not surviving you're not surviving in in 10 minutes right so why are we here and why are our citizens here in this area paying over two million dollars and we're being funded for one unit there's a county resolution it's a resolution 09-37 that says EMS response zones which there are two here it's ps43 and ps44 which is Valor beats and Bella Source should have an EMS unit in it and that was not even considered and I need your help you refers the EMS or yes that and what were they made up of EMS Authority is defined by the laws of Florida that were made in 1980 and mended in 1989 which designates Pinellas County as the EMS Authority which means they have a lot of decision-making power now there is a group efficiently The Authority is the board of County Commissioners but there is a group of a few people that made this decision and there was processes that were supposed to take place it was supposed to go to the EMS advisory Council which is why it's there they're supposed to make recommendations for funding and service levels and these decisions were already made and that meeting is not until June 23rd so how does that happen so when I asked for a request I ask please tell me how you came to these decisions I'd like to know your decision Matrix and what you used to establish that this was not worthy of being pushed forward to the decision makers a week later I didn't get a response I emailed again I'm sorry I was busy I'll get back to you soon as I can and just Friday which is the third time three weeks later surprising reminder I'm waiting on a response you know this is not something that I take lightly you know there would be a difference if a service was being paid for and you were getting it right and of course there are some areas that help other areas financially that's the way it goes right you're paying for a service you have a demonstrated need for a service you can there's nowhere anywhere else in this entire County that there's 5.6 miles between fire stations and you've come to the beaches when you're only getting here by Bridge whether it be drawbridge or or big bridge or whatever pedestrian traffic and two-lane roads and 30 miles an hour we're not getting anywhere fast there's times where we can't even get to a call because Gulf Boulevard is shut down right but there's an accident we need for example and we need other resources that they can't get there without coming a different route or sending different units so we have a geographical need we definitely have a geographic we are a Barrier Island right and there is a resolution by the county that needs to be considered so I have a question yes ma'am you've indicated that the board account Commissioners it's not really being brought front clearly we all contacted they who initiates that item number just for the is recommending it he brought before them of course that would be more of them exactly that would be the Department of Emergency and Safety Services and if you've gone to the website you'll see exactly the the people in that division who they are [Music] yes ma'am have you thought about attending the next commissioner community and bringing some president as well good yes yes uh the the next uh the actually the budget hearings which are not open for public comment but those are the dates set out of June 14 15 16 21 22 and 23 but that's county-wide it hasn't been decided what which one of those days is going to be for EMS but I'm absolutely going to be there absolutely and I've set meetings I've had three meetings with County Commissioners already and I'm going to continue to follow up but I'm I'm fighting very hard for for the services here for you and for your residence because not only do they deserve it but they're paying for it it's probably important percentage so and I would encourage residents to do the same thing compared to the residence is anyone in their audience have any questions I'm trying to talk well I'll bring a microphone hello yes just just real quick if you could put together just like a little mini flow chart so you you I'm assuming it's an online form and that is a request and you send it to room for person who's okay so if you could let us know exact people that are involved I will in that flow process we wasn't happy to go talk to the person they are that would help I'll actually send you the actual request and then I get a request but then I had supplemental information that I wanted them to consider two other supplements two different times of things that I was putting together to show this is a dire need so I'll get all those things too you have my email address you can contact me and my phone number is on there as well anytime you call or text me 24 7.00 I'll answer the phone okay all right thank you all right thank you if I could you mind if I bring it together thank you okay on to item five uh City attorney report uh as for City attorney report this is our first and I think our last meeting happened just after the end of session uh giving you a summary and I've since provided you some memoranda on um on enactments that specifically impact you both as elected officials and as a community and I continue to work with your city manager on um how the city will adapt to some of the more more recent regulatory adoptions one bill we're still watching is Senate Bill 170 it was passed um to my knowledge not yet signed by the governor that was the bill that requires us to do economic impact statements of ordinances and also changes the landscape the legal challenges another similar one in Senate Bill 250 which as a in in the follow-up to Hurricane Ian places some land use regulations and restrictions on communities within 100 miles and that's as I understand it as the pro flies from the point of impact for Hurricane Ian which was can't Costa about 98 of Pinellas County I believe Falls within that 100 mile range um there might be a slight sliver up by Tarpon but generally speaking of the capture this area um not yet signed by the governor either that bill makes it so that any land use regulations that are more restrictive may be nullified if they are adopted within two years of the date of Hurricane Ian's impact and that dates back to September 28 2022 so we'll be direct your back um how how what is more restrictive is not to find fun things we may have to either litigate or defend against whether here or in other communities otherwise your man your manager and I are quite literally in daily contact on various issues and action items going on in this County and I mean in this community and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have my pleasure yes city manager reports thank you vice mayor um starting off with a budget we're getting into the budget season June 1st the property appraiser 70 estimate of tactical values for our city this is the plug goes into the volume set out on Friday the budget and I realized today that there's some parts of the capital projects from the pages that I needed to get in there so I was planning on like just I was planning on having uh the paper copy for you today but I need to get those supplemental pages and then I could provide tomorrow meetings in the next week with the whole project Photoshop which is awesome in 19th and uh yeah so we usually have a work session on the third Monday of the month that is our budget Workshop I wanted to consensus one day you want to do a new book session this month if we want to do it immediately after the workshop or if you'd like to push it to the next which would be the 26 issue how do we have an agenda started for the next Workshop yes is it lightly yes I think it what is it five items at this time I think we're currently about five I know for one uh emergency man it was on the um [Music] some some Charter GPS so some important stuff yeah okay so we probably should do the budget Workshop a different day the work session so you think the work session yeah I've wanted to say the budget yeah Obsession so the workshops so it'll work section [Music] 6 system [Music] experience okay with that or do you want to what they do in the second day it'll be that week of the round team um Monday Tuesday work for everyone so Tuesday okay we're about 22nd what about Thursday that's how you come here too many curves on Wednesday the 21st yes okay okay thank you ah next Golf Boulevard underground project s and we have the locations of all the phase one of the successful Causeway Boulevard we have all locations of equipment putting out except for one that's right a form of golf over and Caldwell Walmart um Duke is wanting to have everything acceptable because they're fighting the conduit through the undergraduate Consultants of Florida is continuing to ask to get something else we're trying to keep kids moving uh again we're kind of getting power on good news through our progress reports the storm water Improvement projects we a survey is underway that George Sheriff associates they are collecting assertive feature product area in the streets just down here on 9th Avenue and 9th Street recently as they get the streets survey they're spending over to the engineer so we're not waiting for it all to get done getting involved in a few seconds in design so once he once he starts getting his preliminary designs together unlike in sort of kind of come in and present them questions the marina Docker basically went out to bid for the replacement of the pilings and the cleaning and wrapping are the ones that didn't need to be replaced the project would be on one sealed bit and then was for under 75 000 if you don't much higher than expected um currently we have 52 000 saved for dock improvements in the marina fund being that it's a chunk of expense I'd like to bring it to the work section to discuss some other options because you know it was significant amount of money it may be the way we you know decided to go or it might want to look at doing more in a later date when we feel like more money that makes sense of where like what our vision for the Marine is so I just wanted to discussion um we just recently got a small amount but close to five thousand dollars back are sandbagging efforts so we got some money back covers for more expensive took a little bit but I've decided into check um the uh we put some Pi Bar in over there at the playground so that it's uh looking nice and wrapped up the uh love out there I brought back to my mind that there's a boardwalk over overlock that goes from the Bayside down to the beach area um it it's getting in a just deteriorating condition my thoughts on it are really it's not even necessary to have um I would recommend moving it because I don't think it's worth falling to replace um there's an observation um yeah that's still a good condition this one is much older what it does is it locks out to the standard and then steps now but it's concern is it is it important for the rental of this facility like two people they're using do they use it for photographs or things like that I don't want to take away from Humanities that we have that involved sure my gut feeling is no um just as a condition you can fit in and citizens so I would say no um I could check on that I feel you know you take it out and you still have a passively down to the beach you can't see anything other means of it being a reason there should be there company I haven't seen it personally but I'm going to take a look at it [Music] citizens Commons regarding the boardwalk at Bayside Park yes I'd like to hear if there's any feedback from anyone if they think what they think about it seems to me that if you don't provide a prescribed place for people to walk the walk where there might be additional erosion or a deterioration of the dunes the mangroves and people have just left the blind or anywhere direct traffic that way across the borderline I'm sorry ma'am just for the record would you mind stating your name and address Kim Shaw elliott1219 thank you for your comments thank you we'll put it put it aside and go ahead and download this one yeah we'll talk about it for one session okay okay um the next council meeting is on July 3rd Monday July 4th is Tuesday night [Music] thank you yeah because uh yeah you're talking about foreign to July 10th okay well that's fine okay thank you um for that type of a project we have a three-bid meeting yes how many children did you give me I have three contractors okay and only one actually submit the bid yes okay we had one that submitted it wasn't a sealed it was a sealed estimate for a total every model but it didn't count enough all right thanks Kyle I know we're very limited on staff uh of course there The Thorn Beach clean up this past weekend uh Northern residents and a couple of presents addressed me about getting our beach rate or often I don't know I think I've only ever seen it once this year I think I think I think because it's three times or after a storm at Washington um is there any way we can increase that um I don't know what the limitations are about you know first off or so you do it I mean there's other people there I'm sure to do without them as a Personnel manual or whatever [Music] so we had a machinery I mean I guess the biggest caveat here too it doesn't waste you know it's about as well yeah currently it was the the Dragon one we drag it down so it's an annual thing it's in February you apply electronically to the state like I said we put in for a trianguly an afternoon for storms um I have the 873 this year I keep track of them I can check with them what's required to the frequency we use our first memory yes and now that we don't have very much Beach it goes pretty quickly it does make a difference between an hour um so yeah let me start with the state to find out if they wanted to increase I appreciate it so approximately how long does that tax take okay so like right now I would say in a couple hours back when we had nourishment we had a big beach you know it would take almost over there okay all right just a quick question will we break the beach we're doing Miller Shores and Valor Beach is that correct we started with Bellaire Beach um [Music] please [Music] I just have one item that I wanted to let you know that the Planning and Zoning Board is going to be on June 14th to review City attorney Mora's draft science button I'm sorry beside Oregon sign language okay thank you okay um next we're moving on to the consent agenda items eight nine on the agenda do I have a motion what should we lose 70 to the second generation okay any discussion citizens comments all the Baylor all right [Music] regular agenda item 10 is a consideration of ordinance 23-03 Mr Laura would you like to read this ordinance please happily Madam vice mayor one moment please this ordinance 23-03 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida mending the city of Bellaire Beach Comprehensive plan pursuant to the evaluation and Appraisal process of section 163.319 for the statutes and the amendment process of sections 163.3184 Florida Statutes adopting new goals objectives and policies and Maps as presented here in below providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for severability providing for the repeal of all the ordinances and conflict here with and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance 23-03 on first reading by title only okay to evolution second discussion remember Notaro motion November Livingstone seconded all right was it going to be a presentation yes so with that we're prepared to go to staff presentation good evening before everyone turn off their mics I'm going to try and turn this one on let's see I'm a low Talker by Nature so I appreciate this he's getting the mic going and he's trying to get the speakers going because I am hello there you go thank you um so I believe it's it's nice to be here um my name is Linda Fisher I work for forward Pinellas you probably know as best as the countywide agency that coordinates Transportation plan we also work with land use but wearing another hat we also provide technical assistance to the local governments in particular we do a lot of comprehensive plan updates because that's the Hat I'm wearing today I'm here to help you update your content um just as a reminder the purpose of the comprehensive plan is to provide a policy basis for the regulations that the city adopts and the decisions that you make in particular it governs land use the plan establishes a set of future language categories that establish where different land uses can go in the city and how densely the land can be developed from the state's perspective the purpose of the comprehensive plan is to help regulate the growth of your community but for a stable community like yours the purpose is really to maintain the quality of life that you have you do need to update your comp plan every seven years but to make sure that your policies are still current and to stay up to date with any changes to state law you also have to update the maps and data that support your plan and any terminology or references that change over time and this is also your opportunity to add or update any local policy priorities as you see and there's a defined process the draft amendments need to be reviewed by your designated local planning agency which in your cases you're planning and so important um your board has done that they help a public hearing on May 8th and voted to recommend that the city council approve the draft that's in front of you and now it's your turn to review and consider the draft amendments this is the first with two public hearings that you're required to hold for this process if you vote to approve the Amendments then the next step will be to transmit them to the state for review and I'll talk more about that later in the process for the presentation but first let's take a step back and talk about what's in this draft what would be changing from your current Conference of time the first and most important group of amendments are to address three new state laws that have been passed since you last updated your plan the first is what's called The Parallel flood Act passed in 2015. and it requires you to adopt strategies that address the risks of flooding hurricanes and Civil Wars in their specific language that you need to adopt so the draft amendments include a number of new objectives and policies to address the new law however year of each community so you've been addressing these issues forever you already do this so it's really just a matter of spelling out what kind of strategies that you already practice and you follow the same Coastal Construction codes and postal setback requirements FEMA floodplain management organizations we participate in the National Court insurance program and so forth so all I did in the strap to say the things you already do and put it in your in your drawing then another new law that was passed last year is called the private property rights act this law is really largely symbolic it requires you to adopt a new private property rights element in your comprehensive plan and the statute provides a specific language addressing what people are legally allowed to do with their men it requires you to respect judicially acknowledged and constitutionally protected private property rights in other words it's acknowledging rights that already exist it's not creating new ways those existing rights state that the government cannot take a person's land and then the property owner has the right to use and control their land but it is subject to state law and local ordinances so that includes your comprehensive plan and your zoning code so it's also acknowledging your right as a city to practice reasonable land abbreviations the last of the new laws is one that doesn't have an immediate impact on the city but I included it for two diligence in case it should apply in the future it's called the live local act and it was just signed back in March it allows certain affordable housing developments to override some local comprehensive plan and zoning regulations it only applies to land zone for commercial industrial and mixed use which you don't currently have in the city but I drafted a policy that just acknowledges that the law exists that way if you own your land visitations could change should change in the future or if the state law changes in a way to make it apply to the city then you're not in contact um as noted on the slide I do need to correct statutory reference in the policy I inadvertently reference an identical statute that applies to counties so I just need to update by government cities do you have any questions so far about these these pre-laws so those are the minimum policy amendments that need to be so you're planning and zoning board held a series of meetings between January and may to review the draft plan and I want to commend your board for being very engaged and thoughtful throughout the entire process not every city has that so they were a pleasure to work with we did a technical review of the draft plan and they also voted to make some recommendations to you for updated policy highest priority issue that they identified is the high volume of traffic they're passing through the city due to higher density of Redevelopment and tourism from your neighboring communities well that's not a problem that we can solve for the comprehensive client update this is your place to identify actions that you take that you would take that might come up and that includes things like using the forward Pinellas Forum to work directly with those other local governments and Pinellas County for example you could explore whether there are options for Traffic Control measures or either technological or law enforcement but that could make it easier for your residents to exit from their local streets onto the floor and it would also be a needs to seek funding to pay for this measures we also talked about making sure foreign Pinellas has accurate data that that to come and figure off shower patterns are different from the mainland ears are driven by tourism not nine to five years and we can't use the same one-size-fits-all approach that we use for this the board recommends that the city considered designating a specific representative or even a committee but to reach out and work with work and notice to to work for a nursing position the next issue is the word identified what is the importance of the Builder of each Marine so if your current plan has a policy providing for the potential Redevelopment of the marina with presidential uses in the future and the board recommends the leading that policy and replacing it with others that recognize an Arena's importance to the scene to declare that the the city desires to keep the marina as a Marina and to prioritize it as much as possible for the indoor medicine and then the last major group of recommended policy editions of concerns Prosthetics and additional funding sources through things like seeking France let's take a look at transportation funding and even potentially the use of renewable resources they're consuming Excel events conditions [Music] so now it is the council's decision whether to accept those recommendations or to make any further changes to their academics if you hope to approve the draft at this first hearing then two things happen next so the document will need to be transmitted to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity which is the state agency charged with reviewing qualified amendments and copies will need to be sent to a number of other state and Regional agencies and the local governments that are needed to be adjacent to you we will all have the option to weigh in my experience is that virtually those people will actually weigh in but they have 30 days to do it and then overlap with that same time period the Deo has 60 days to review the plan once they are done with their review they will issue what's called an objections recommendations and comments report or full report and if they feel that anything that you propose doesn't need state law or needs a technical review then they'll let you know typically we get one or two very minor comments just wanting to make data citations or clarify something that's usually not city has 180 days to respond to the orc again I don't think it will take that long once you make changes and you hold a second public hearing to officially adopt the updated comprehensive plan it goes back to Deo and another 45 days to review and unless there is a chance of a challenge then it becomes becomes effective as soon as they issue their notice that they put it so there is a built-in process where citizens can challenge or compliment update but I've been doing this for 25 years when I have literally never seen it happen [Music] a lot of questions thank you okay so we have erosion and a second on the board for any

consideration to approve the adopt the park program agreement from City of Ballard Beach this is in association with the Fowler Beach Community Foundation and um do we have a motion to go forward okay it's okay thank you Kyle thank you so this is an agreement uh to enable uh unification programs within the city and um to work out with the Harvard Beach Community Foundation the agreement allows for businesses churches schools neighborhood certain groups or even just individual measurements to give back to community parks by donating amenities planting plants kind of lays out timetables So based on what the individual or group is donating kind of sets up a time period for for them adopted program all the adoption ideas programs submitted and approved my city so as they come in we'll assessment so they're available on technology foreign the donations of monetary donations they also have worked with them so you want to imagine your presidential fee but it goes through the foundation to enable the donator to have a taxable payoff so that's all we're working to function with them the city what's the park is adopted by a group individuals the city and put a sign saying this yes investigations such and such as period of time we continue to talk about responsibility to the city and the responsibilities of the back of the party continue things that the city does as far as you know blowing trimming your trees you know anything collecting garbage all that all the main things that we should be contribute on a routine basis and then the adopting party depending on what they decided to do will um you know contribute funds though if they want to put together a data to declare a garden bed area and put some new plants um and then you know like work if they want to maintain some content and they want to stop buying on their teammates to make sure it's free we need to know but the idea is again to just allow the community to help improve our extremacy provide a

search good surges and how it occurs where it starts and touristical flooding and what insurance companies in the state I've also been in contact as I go to Santa Scott's office since late last year we've already clean the 2.0 I was under the impression that Ian was going to look at this area even though didn't practice here with the flight cost which it is just got notified today that another private sure my risk of leading the state so they're all telling us to go to antibiotic Faith Senator Scott is trying to introduce legislation this month to get more private insurance back into the market our state senators did the same thing last December with the winning charge could cost nothing but a mess uh these problems really aren't that hard to reside back in 1900 it was eight town a little bit West of us Galveston experiencing cat fire in a hurricane wiped out the whole town level two years later they built three mile sequel extended it over the years to 10 miles now that Seawall was crying working and I think five [Music] eating across the federal government 4 billion dollars at one school so I went to Center this guy said why don't we take that one and invest in storm drainage catch bases pups sea walls instead of just pump it out on your repair those homes that get washed away every year or whatever like that well I don't know if that would resonate to the taxpayers but we can just keep spending cash fully humidified but isn't going to be too bad so sadly today I was finally giving information because I've been happier it was 2.0 just give my constituents your constituents was described so explanation on where the city discount 20 percent we received along with somebody who's submitting an elevation certificate and the adjacent rate now adjacent grade is the bottom grade of the ground okay so if you spray these two generally into the adjacent rate take a show on your yard dig down you'll find sand about a foot down okay second third what's in here originally it came in when they built the houses so you have prayers and everything okay anyway no one can show me where there's a Jason Gray discounts so now I was giving a lay aside
