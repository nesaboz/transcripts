    "transcript": "all right good evening everyone welcome to the monday may 3rd regular city council meeting of the city of del oro beach before we do the pledge of allegiance um my sad announcement to make this weekend a very good friend of mine neighbor um long-term president of bellar beach passed away his name is ron lasara and if you were here last year you saw his girls do the they performed at the um festival they came here they were one of the first people to do the pledge of allegiance got very suddenly and it was real tragic so um i'm going to ask that we rise and observe a moment of silence for ron and for his family and for his children and keeping in your prayers if you're a praying person because i know the family would appreciate that and we'll do that at the pledge of allegiance thank you i pledge allegiance to the republic which is one nation under council councilmember frank banker council member glenn gunn council member leslie noterow here council member

citizen comments everyone has a three-minute presentation on any topic that is not on the agenda if it's an item that's on the agenda we'll get to you later on we i promise there will be a time for everyone to speak on any agenda item if you do speak please come up here and please speak just like i'm doing right now about one inch away from the microphone everyone will be able to hear you please give your name an address and address the counsel anyone would anyone like to address counsel tonight john hansen and then debbie maul mr mayor yes just as an administrative uh remark here the city manager and his staff did some tweaking on the audio in here and perhaps people in the back if you have any problems hearing or if you have any problems here i'm seeing thumbs up thumbs up on this side a lot of thumbs up okay so okay we got it it sounds good okay nobody ever has a problem here john hanson there you go old drill instructor john hanzik on 22nd street i actually have a compliment which i'll give second and a complaint which i'm going to give you first the complaint is contractors doing all of this utility work are built forward are using the vacant lot at the corner of gulf in 22nd as a parking lot and a dump and i say don't because the gentleman who owns the property and is in the process of getting his plans approved for construction comes around about every seven to ten days to cut his grasp from the palm trees before he can actually cut that that block the last two times he's had picked up cones traffic cones and more importantly empty water bottles and trash now the compliment is the ajax plumbing or excuse me um hayden they completed paving 22nd belair island estates and i observed periodically them doing their job again drivers of the dump trucks well with those folks feeling them the workers manning the equipment and doing the raking hydrating they picked up after themselves i'd like them to be told that that was appreciated and i'd like something to be done about all these contractors one the one in particular i see using quite frequently is that contractor right they parked their pickup trucks they could win there they think that that's their place to do their thing and i know i i caught an earful this past weekend for my soon-to-be new neighbor whenever he gets his plans approved so it is private property it's not public property so it's something to be said to that contractor and the subs it would be most appreciated thank you thank you mr hansen mrs i'm going to refer this to you if you'll please if you if you care to speak about it later during your time you can um if not i'd like you to address it directly with mr hansen and the property owner he's correct this is private property thank you hi i'm debbie maul i live at 115 cosmo boulevard and i just wanted to present two things i'd like you to consider first it's my understanding that we allow baylor shore to share our contract with pinellas county sheriffs for our upcoming budget discussion this summer i'd like you to consider having embellished your contract on their own with the sheriffs uh these are my concerns first we pay uh first bellar store pays about seven percent of what we pay for our contract they pay thirty five thousand eighty eight dollars a year i believe according to their minutes and we pay five hundred and three thousand eight hundred and eight dollars according to our budget i believe last month bellar store had 154 events as reported at their meeting by the sheriff's department and we had 717 that means we paid 58.55 cents per event while fellowshire paid only 18.98 per event belair sure had about 17.68 of the calls but only paid seven percent of the total sheriff's budget i believe um that i read in their minutes mandela shorts minutes that they pay for 45 minutes of sheriff's time i can't remember it was per shift or per day so i'm giving them the benefit of their dollars and per shift in my calculations and they also stated in their minutes that this was not even enough time to do all the house checks that they have scheduled so not only does this mean that the citizens tax dollars in baylor beach are subsidizing belarus or sheriff's patrol but that we the citizens of bella beach are actually paying the shares to harass our own citizens who put up umbrellas on our own deeded accesses as well as for florida's public land i think if our citizens were aware of this they would not be very happy about it so i'm asking you all including our attorney to look into the legality of this issue and to reconsider this for our next year's budget in addition i noted that bella store is hosting um the bc meeting on july 28th at our own city hall i'm assuming that we're charging bellair shore for the rental of our community center for this meeting since in the past we have denied our own local girl scout troop from using our community center without charge i think we could have submitted significant issues if we allow baylor shore to use our community center for free so i really would like to see that there's a contract sign for them to use our city hall uh in the past up to maybe five to eight years ago we have a good relationship with baylor shore i mean people have moved in and things have changed we've maintained and upgraded the access and the parking lots which i don't disagree with doing except they allow bella uh bellerop allows significant numbers of construction vehicles to drive over the gate rails and park in the lots and let's witness this firsthand that creates additional wear and tear on the rails and the parking lot that we have to pay for we drag their homeowners private beach property we do that heck even our own city manager had to get homeowners approval for the gulf beautification project from their own citizens now i know that we got pinellas county money for that but they did as well so um i would just like you guys to look into this for the coming years thank you thank you 207 harrison avenue i just want to um thank you all for or actually kind of give it some of the rewards that were spoken earlier about ajax hayden they did a great job paying me in case you're snapping um we had an incident today that i think photos or emails all of you all that we had a concrete truck on there's an avenue that does some pretty deep you know divots in the road uh i would just say in the future this is kind of why i've been preaching about impact fees and things such as that really taking a look at our comp plans i would say in the future that maybe we don't issue permits during the time we're paving because and especially if it's a concrete truck we'll kind of reconsider you know the time allowance for that asphalt to harden before we we allow a concrete truck on the road so just to fyi and take a look at the email and took photographs if you guys have time to run by there but just something to consider in the future i'm gonna refer this to mr reeves and mr riley for follow-up thank you damage to our property i believe you can pursue that i don't know what the circumstances were but it wasn't i'm hearing from jody shirley as it wasn't paid like that any other citizens seeing no other hands on my clothes and comments sure are you here to present i am here we have mills county sheriff's officers sure good evening sergeant switch with pinellas county sheriff's office for the month of march 2021 for the ucr property in person crime reporting there was a total of two incidents that were labeled as assaults i did look those incidents up one was a domestic battery and the other was just a run-of-the-mill battery where the victim didn't want to prosecute for march of 2021 there were a total of three people arrested um again one was for the domestic battery one was for a warrant and one was for dpwi for that month also there were 713 total events and leading that was traffic enforcement in which 165 traffic stops were conducted and then in those 107-65 traffic stops a total well they must have been traffic stops and parking violations and 148 citations and warnings were issued and for citations issued a total of 10 citations were issued and the other were parking violations and then there were some boating stops along the intercoastal waterway also and then there were two crashes that were investigated in the city and that is all sheriff once again a fine job by the department here um i mean one of those incidents sounds like domestic violence which there's not much you can do other than to react to it which you did it looks like this is excellent you know i'm looking through the year here today we have six incidents in our whole city i mean there's people have six incidents in an hour so we've got six in a year here today that's fantastic so congratulations to everyone in the department and keep up the great work and as always i'll pass it along to the other ships thank you anyone else on council yes yes we just heard from this mall about that and the relationship is your officers basically manage the stopped doing biller same shift correctly right is that correct yes sir so why can't we look at bellaire shore stats compared to ours and we can track those off and kind of get a big picture overview of what's going on between hillary beach and baylor shore and maybe you can connect the dots on some of the things in this falls where you know so my recommendation is in the future and we get to see the bellashore steps i would have to look and see when the reporting is sent to us should we come out and present at the city meetings but i don't see that it's not possible i'll pass that along to captain lioner to see if that's something that it just makes sense that our it's our guy kind of working both areas so why not wire the two together so we keep the big picture on this thing councilman i agree with you i've actually made that request several months ago and i know it made it to the sheriff and i've never seen it i said let's let's see what's happening over there from an enforcement point of view um you know we see what's happening sometimes with you know enforcement here but we don't know what's happening over there and i think some of the residents are you know of the impression that you know either there's too much enforcement not enough enforcement you know we'd like to see what's going on i mean it seems to be at least these reports the general reports seem like their public record if you're presenting them i know you're presenting them and better sure so um you know we could go and get the minutes but the minutes typically come out a month or so later so if you could forward them to us to what the councilman you know said i think that's a great thing i know that i've made that request before also so we'll double that request how's that right as soon as i leave here i'll follow the email other council members dave thank you for your service i think what may help also is us if we just go ahead and do a records request just on those with bel air shore for saying the last year and we've got some immediate stats and then we can look at maybe either renegotiating based upon the number of calls or something like that or you know splitting up whatever works best to both party's advantage anyone's on council did anyone in uh from the city have any questions for the sheriff sure thank you very much again and if you can get back to mr reese to let us know what the uh what the result will be on that if not we can do it via records requests i'm sure okay thank you all right we're gonna move to the consent agenda as amended so it's gonna be items four through eight and then by eleven i'm gonna read them once and then we're going to approve them um so i'm gonna ask for a motion to bring the consent agenda as a group so it's item for the approval of the april 5th 2021 city council meeting minutes item five approval of the april 14 2021 city attorney riley presentation minutes item six approval of april 26 2021 special city council minutes item seven approval of april 26 2021 city council work session minutes item eight proclamation 52nd annual professional municipal clerks week and item 11 city council acceptance of pinellas county 2020 local mitigation strategy lms annual products report and the pinellas county multi-jurisdictional community rating system crs annual report for program for public information flood plain management plan flood insurance improvement plan and flood response plan that includes the county wide hazard mitigation plan it provides public information and communication regarding flooding savings and flood insurance purchased through the nfip do i have a motion to us to approve all of that package so it gathers does even tarot seconds there's no discussion on this we just pass it as a whole so we're approving items four through eight as i just read them and item eleven as i just read it all in favor hi anyone post passage unanimously unanimously and that completes the consent agenda we now move to the regular agenda we have two items that were moved first item was previously item nine and that's what we're going to do first it's now having 12 and that is consideration of accepting the planning and zoning board code final review final report description is to accept the board's final report for future consideration and action first we have a motion yes the only reason i pulled this was because we at the workshop we went through the the line items and the recommendations and pretty much hit on all of those and came up with action items the only thing that we didn't really come up with any other plan of action for was the uh the recommendation about citizen input to prioritizing code enforcement and uh what i'd like to do is just make a recommendation i can work with the city manager and his code enforcement and this recommendation would kind of align with the city manager's intention later on in the budget process to bring up the reorganization of co-reinforcements and how that's going to work but rather than try to spool up another committee on this sort of thing i think we have the data to probably to make some smart decisions with that thing and i plan on sitting down with the city manager and laura in code enforcement and go through their records and their uh their lists we get them every month at the council meetings and just try to characterize what the major players are and come back with some prioritizations for code enforcement which kind of uh segues into some of the other discussion we had about code enforcement there were some concerns about focusing on the wrong things and that sort of thing well what i want to mention is that code enforcement is an important thing for us because while we haven't gotten into real specifics of what a a premier residential community looks like we basically describe what our premiere or what our our thoughts are about our community should look like in our codes our codes are the foundation the basis for what our community thinks the place should look like so i just want to say a way that codes are important the ordinances support our strategic plan and aesthetics and that and while we may not specifically say this is exactly what our community should look like in our strategic plan our codes basically describe what that is and it's a foundation for how good neighbors work and while we don't necessarily enforce codes all the time it is a basis for when somebody thinks somebody's not living up to their obligations as a good neighbor it gives us a fallback position to enforce that that's all i want to say thank you the way i understand this number 9 here is we're accepting the board's report but we're not implementing that report we just had about a two-hour session as council member dunn just said so this is we've done this before we accept it for for final review in fact if anyone read the minutes of the work session pretty much had most of the concerns that we kind of had consensus on so each one of those actually represents an ordinance change that has to be changed separately so there's going to be more debate on this and i think that's also where you're concerned you know with the code actually comes in and we certainly can prioritize it so we have very healthy discussion i think with that and um you know i think we'll probably have more so um i'm fine with it you know with that understanding basically it was a certain look and feel to bel air beach that drew us all here and uh i know sometimes coach lynch is angry and we want to try to change things and and tear down for our own our own purposes but uh at the end of the day the more of it that we remove uh the less it becomes balarama beach and becomes some other town that we've moved away from so i'm hoping that everyone is understanding as we go through this code that not picking on anyone we're just trying to make sure that we're that premier city that everyone loved whenever they first came here that's all i've got to say anyone on council a and it's consideration of accepting the planning and zoning board code and final uh final report final report this will uh yes bo will accept the code's final report for future consideration and action all in favor aye aye you have to take what was item 10 and it's now 12b and that's consideration of approval of the local option fuel tax in your local agreement excuse me yes it was part of the uh it was part of the incentive it's not because it's consent agenda but it will be discussed i have a feeling when we get to have this part of the show i'll say something um in fact we actually have a little honor for the city clerks at our mayor's council so yeah that's just so everybody knows that's the honoring the municipal clerks week and uh so that's what we're gonna be doing here um we may just make a prop proclamation which is in the packet and but later on we get to patty's section of some stuff i think probably to say to you okay so um we're on it 10 now this is consideration approval of the local option fuel tax interlocal agreement uh first emotion so i uh actually uh read through this and even though it's a five cent uh the potential for a five cent tax uh i saw opportunity for our town uh not so much with funds but as a way that maybe we should go to fort pinellas and sort of lobby to raise our concerns about what's going on with our traffic how it's not only affecting us but it's also affecting baylor's shore and also failure bluff more than anyone else it's it's these three communities uh we're in a sort of unique position compared to all the other towns in pinellas county uh most of these most of these cities have direct access to have i would call premium vacation spots and that would be clearwater beach and saint pete beach no one is required to go through another town to get to these cities they can right off the interstate or right off highway 60. we are a little bit different because as soon as traffic backs up google says go go that way go through bellaire beach it's faster and what i've noticed is whenever boulevard stops google says go down 19 head up bay shore make a left and then you'll you'll be ahead of five cars that you were behind five minutes ago i hate that this is happening and really i believe that the only real fix would be a bridge going over to sand key basically from clearwater over to sandy even if someone said let's do this let's get started tomorrow we're talking 10 to 20 years before anything like that would ever happen so so basically what i recommend is that even though it's too late now we should get the three communities together and enjoy every approach for canalis and say we think we should get a little bit more than what you're giving us and instead of taking it from everyone you should take it from clear to learn because at the end of the day there are clear winners in this this whole situation tonight i'm i'm going to vote yes on this because basically if it doesn't go through which is it's a little too late now to get started on this then there's no chance for an increase at all we get point zero nine percent is that right um you know at this point i'll take it uh i think it's worth it even though gas costs uh more now i just see all the people coming in and i see potential for for more revenue for this city so i think in the next year i'm going to work with everyone here and and the other two neighboring cities and see if we can do something about this and maybe maybe have the rights of how to readjust it thank you the reason why i had asked to move this into this regular agenda instead of consent agenda is the rate itself i think it's pathetic 0.09 that means we're getting less than a penny out of every dollar that's collected on this tax we're paying five cents a gallon um but we're getting basically nothing back to give you an idea kind of dovetails a little bit with what vice mayor said clearwater gets 6.69 saint petersburg it's 15.3 pinellas park gets 3 and of course this is the county's tax so they get 60 i mean we're doing the heavy lifting we're taking the heavy traffic we're getting nothing so i'm not going to vote for this tonight and the only reason also that i'm not going to vote for is i don't even see how the methodology was calculated there's nothing in this paperwork here that shows how they came up with these numbers there's no computation there's nothing that i can check back to see that they did their due diligence and they're asking us to sign off on what you know promises to be an interlocal agreement without giving us any real support for how they came up with their numbers than any proof so not quite sure glenn it looks like you want to say something mayor how the percentages are calculated is by population and i verified that again today and it's the 60 goes to the county but 40 is divided by the rest of the cities in the county and that's divided based on population we haven't checked that to make sure that their calculations are correct right and we don't know if it's the population pre-sentences or post-censuses right no i don't know the exact number i can't tell you that but that this is an interlocal agreement you know it's typically run in 10-year cycles and we get the local option gas tax every month and it's all the cities are sharing that there's some sharing a little more than others that's well based on the population from what the camp has done but i decided with well you know i've been on traffic for a while here and it's not getting any better there's no solutions you and i've met multiple times with the county people they've given us a couple things but it's not making that big of a difference really not from what i can see and um you know a bridge sure it'll take 15 years but you might want to start it now because i can't imagine you know one of the things last year before covet hit and the mayor's council they were talking about the visit clearwater saint pete was so happy that they were they've gotten the word out to everyone in the country they were showing us billboards in boston in new york city and stuff and they said well now that we've done that of course it was right before govind is that now we're going to focus on getting the people within the state to start coming here so that's where they're going with this they want more day trippers coming over from you know the mainland and from the inner portions of florida so um i think whatever we have now we might be looking back at these being the good old days if they get their wish so um just something to think about so i i personally would like to see some more information that's my feeling and other council members right yeah um the big problem i have with this these penny pension fuel taxes i've experienced for over three years they seemed that one of those would take place but they never ended up the other thing is we have a federal government right now that's really pushing electric cars electric vehicles they're not going to pay assemblies and i've asked numerous states senators legislators that came from the construction world most of the money for highway usage comes from the gas taxes right these electric cars partial electric cars we're not getting any revenue from they still tear up the roads they still care about bridges what are we going to do to replace that boss revenue if buying gets in his way my new truck is going to be a relic i mean all right this could be a this could be a tax of nothing all right how much is it really going to save us and how much is it going to do for us i agree with the council we need a bridge from sandy but you come from the state of new jersey don't you yeah at the most is and i was just riding the roads of new jersey and i mentioned to june i said roads are as bad as they've ever been but their taxes are higher than they've ever been so you're right frank [Music] oh yes my question is to the city manager so if we don't pass this we get nothing right is that how it works at this point because there's no negotiating i don't feel like at this point in the process it's too late so if we don't vote for this we just absolutely get nothing well we we currently have never local agreement on the existing all this is doing is the giving the county the county is telling us we will share in the 5 cent if they implement if they don't implement it which is if they've got until october to implement but what the uh county administrator asks us is to get the inner local agreement approved so if it is implemented then at least going forward we're going to get part of it but at the current time i don't know if i'm not doing this because we are still under the other one this is just and i'm it doesn't require 100 approval i think that it's a majority i don't know what that number is but i believe that's what i read is that some people may not sign it and either way they'll still get it if it's approved that was actually going to be my next question so thank you advice foreign personal political opinions aside i think that the day of reckoning for electric vehicles are coming i mean that that subject is getting a lot of visibility now exactly what you're saying but political personal political opinion to the side i asked what's best for the city of miller beach and if that provides one dollar more than what we have in our budget now and i am all for supporting this thing we can go back and try to negotiate a higher rate but why why would we turn down money coming in to the city of military that makes no sense whatsoever if it's a dollar more than what we had yesterday i am all for it and we need to get smart about this fees are the way to go and as it as it showed in the presentation from canelo county one third of that money comes from non-residents so i mean these are all these are all the people coming down on spring break or on vacation or the snow birds or whatever they're not necessarily homesteaded residents but they're bringing money in and we should take advantage of it but to just cut up our noses fight our faith because you know uh monetary sense whatsoever thank you someone correct me if i'm wrong but the way i read it going to get that tax whether we've approved it or not i think i think this whole if the county approves yes i think this whole thing should go back to county committee and have it retooled i think it's unfair that we take the burden of the traffic um electric vehicles i'm not getting political but it's it's a fact of life um they're they're here and they're here to stay i just don't think uh we should jump on this and say bravo to the county if we pass it and we're gonna get submitted i'll go and then you go again so you don't negotiate contracts after he signed he negotiated before he decided this is before we signed it we don't have to sign this today the county hasn't passed this it's not even on their agenda right now they have until october it's incumbent on us there's been at least two possibly three the readers will praise the question as to what happens if we don't do it we can get a good answer to that so go back to the county and find out that county commissioners meeting every single month and be it a representative from our council or our city manager goes there our legal representative writes a letter to them and we square this away this is negotiable right now maybe we can ask the worst they could say is no i'm not this is to sign this is what's known as a contract of adhesion sign where else uh we're not in that position right now sure i'll take the money but you said something council member gun that one-third is paid by the outside people it means two-thirds paid by the inside people that's me that's the people that i'm looking at out here and if you're going to pay two-thirds of this tax i want you to get more than that it's not a tax one second don't interrupt it it is a tax it's a tax it's a fuel tax so it's um if you're gonna get more than one penny on every dollar that the county collects i just think that's a pathetic return for us and it's always the same cities that are benefiting on this yet you're right we get to wear ontario and destroys our quality of life some of these other cities aren't experiencing that same problem hey yes one of the reasons why there's a dates matter yes they have to have it completely they have to complete it by october however i think that there's a flow of processes that must occur and they're looking for a june 1st deadline on everyone is that right man yes county asked that all the city managers to take this to our council and give back to us by may 25th and that's that's what we're talking about and that was from the county administration and uh they said basically the state of florida would not allow it uh if it goes beyond the certainty also i'd like to address the electrical vehicle it's capitalism basically uh what's going to happen is eventually these comedian stores are not going to be able to sell fuel what's going to happen they're going to install electric fuel pumps so if you think they're just going to give it away it's not going to happen it's going to be another form of fuel and we will be taxed on that also so yeah during the transition you're going to have just like we have right now you're going to have gas you're going to have electric and a little by little be more and more electric but all of these convenience stores are going to have to step up and whenever that happens if any of us think that pinellas county and the state of florida are not going to cash in on that opportunity um you know that's something maybe you should reconsider i i agree with you thousand percent but i've dealt with the oil lobby for years and i come from an area where natural gas floors and you didn't see no natural gas pumps in the southern part of the states and that like that and now we just really are restricting the natural gas plate lines okay a lot of these electric cars that go in there and charge for free right now there's one at indian rocks beach uh there's a couple of landing bronze beaches at the airport and i agree with you one one day someone's going to say we have to put a tax on but that tax isn't today i really believe the county is trying to get all the communities to prove this to say oh everybody wants to do this so let's let's move this needs to be retooled any other council members let's open this up to the citizens citizens any comments saying no comments and i'm bringing it back to council for final word okay i'm gonna i'm gonna do this by the way i'm not gonna do this by the voice vote i want the votes recorded on this one um so item chad which has now been revised is uh consideration of approval of the local option fuel tax in our local agreement and the description is approval of the agreement between pinellas county and pinellas county municipalities for the administration and expenditure of the prosecuto will approve that in bermuda county uh madam clerk would you please call them council member rita swope yes council member leslie notaro aye councilmember glenn gunn aye council member frank banker no councilmember robin aki no vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo no so the pass is 4-3 sorry to go

that council we have five one two three we have six people up for consideration bronze again mark goldman john hansek john j hayes robert reisberg and jody shirley first i just need a motion for consideration of this group of individuals do i have that so hey second hockey giving comments before i put it to florida i just like to thank everyone for uh for signing out nominating themselves with that said obviously our thanks for for coming out to do this and coming out actually for the second time is there what we typically will do is allow anyone who wishes to speak in their uh own support or in support of another person uh to come up and of course you can say something against the person too just let's keep it polite here if we could keep it factual based so with that said i see some individuals in the audience would they would like to address counsel uh mark i don't think you're on this one i'll have you on the next one mark goldman i think right all right wait hang on hang on one sec one second mark b is on number 13. i don't see my number 12 city okay mayor and residents that chose to attend seating i'm mark goldman i'm a resident for almost 21 years now and spent about two years on the undergrounding committee trying to get that project completed and happy to announce that it was completed and quite satisfactorily um if anybody doubts what the finished product looked like take a ride down any of the streets on the belly or out of the states and you'll see what can happen in your part of the city as well we did during that time frame set up a framework for any other streets or groups of streets in the city to take advantage of the same processes that we used so i urge you to get with your folks and if you like what you see then we'll help you get there as well the my interest in wanting to be on the committee is because i think that we need more citizens input into what's going on in the city and this is a great forum for us to get into the ground roots see the things that are coming about in the future so i'm offering to do my time there one more thing i just wanted to say is that the success of the builder island estates undergrounding project is very very much because of the amazing effort from lynn reeves his negotiation skill his work with the contractors and the project managers was just outstanding and he told us what he could do and he delivered and he got it done for under budget and i know that those people who are getting refunds are very happy about that so a thank you for the city for allowing me of the work that lynn did and look forward to being on the committee in future thank you mark dean i think what you should do as a council is actually have all six people on that committee because there are times that you might find one person not being able to make it the other person can fill in but since six thank you anyone else yes sir based on that statement i would like to propose an amendment to this where we choose five primary members and one alternate and the reason behind that is to have five an odd number who can conduct business and yet these are very busy people they have other careers and they are volunteering their time to assist us and they bring a lot of skill sets to us and a lot of action and business act and we need to take advantage of all them so if somebody's out of pocket traveling or called away by other duties and business or whatever we have the alternative we also slip in and help condemn people so that's my amendment i propose them in five primaries i don't know that i can accept your amendment right now and i'll tell you why this was the formation of the committee was passed as i recall last time and that was passed by a um ordinance or resolution i don't remember but we way so we can do that and there's nothing that says we can't use the law you know the person doesn't need four votes to get on this committee um but we there's nothing saying that we cannot amend that that we have to amend it the proper way for an ordinance i don't think we can just add it so it's a great suggestion and i don't think i want to lose the people either but you know let's do it the right way yes okay all right other council comments do you need a table on this thing no i don't think so i think we can move i bet everybody wants to move i'll just take consensus everybody wants to move forward with getting individuals on and if you need in order for this to happen our rules say you have to have four votes so it is you're gonna vote for up to five members you can vote for zero one two all the way up to five um if anybody gets four votes is on anyone else is come back and we can amend this but we're going to need two meetings before we can amend that so it might be a little bit of you know maybe two months before we do it but i don't think that's a bad idea actually we kind of missed that one we probably should have had walter meets in there but we got the committee so we'll amend it patty do you have ballots to pass out or do you want the ones the ones that we have in here they're at your seat there's a there's one at your seat yes there it is okay council we're going to take it to vote at this point um when you're ready we'll add it to patty vote for up to five okay do it too much for our members manager [Applause] patty if you could just go through relatively slowly because lynn and i are both recording this and if you take it in the order that the names are on the sheet here that would be great but it doesn't really matter but it goes [Applause] so council member aki voted for mr saganik mr hanzik mr risberg and ms shirley councilmember bankerd voted for mr seganik mr goldman mr hanzik mr risberg and miss shirley vice mayor goddess

and uh thank you for working on the commitment on the award so far hopefully we get you on the full board here in a couple minutes thank you very much thank you any other citizen comments back to council let's bring it up for a vote so this is for consideration of appointment of park and recreation board walter november nora kodak who we just heard from to a full board member yes vote accomplishes that i'm going to take voice vote all in favor aye aye anyone opposed seven to zero congratulations this is consideration of resolution 2001-04 it's a resolution of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida establishing an audit committee providing for membership of the audit committee providing for the selection of a chair providing for duties and responsibilities thereof providing for meetings and providing for an effective day this is consideration to establish a committee for review of city annual financials internal controls and compliance and policies and procedures we deferred this from last time um first motion so gaddis second leslie detero is raising her hand i think it's something needed we've discussed this in the past i had a procedural question and i'm sorry i can't reach out to you earlier mr riley i hate to blindside you so if you need an adjournment i know i'm sorry to do this but there's no other way unfortunately but the rules so the audit committee is specified under state statutes under florida 218-391 and it calls for it to be an audit committee what is being proposed here is to basically take the citizens advisory committee that we just appointed and add one council member to it and make that the audit committee now historically we have had i would say a prohibition but we discourage people from serving on two boards in fact if you're on board of adjustment and you're on the planning where you're actually prohibited from serving on two points it's not clear with regard to the uh the parks and rec board and some of the other ports but um it's what we've typically followed so what i'm throwing to you is i just want to make sure because the penalty if we don't do this right is an invalidation not that we're going to challenge it but perhaps a losing order might challenge it so the process has to be proper so what i'm asking you is based on the proposal that's here which is to utilize the citizens advisory committee plus one council member is that good work in terms of statute 218-391 yes that's all i need to know but i'll give you a better answer than that i reviewed the statute and the principal requirement as you need one person from the governing body which would be one of the seven of you and that the i also reviewed the code provisions related to the citizens advisory committee there's no prohibition like in one or two of the other committees so since it's not prohibited it's permissible and it comes down to a discussion among the city council members and implementing this if this is advisable from your perspective or not is this considered an ad hoc community under the terms of our charter i would say it is so under an ad hoc committee oh well this is a committee that's based on a statute so i would say that this the statute requires a minimum of three people and one of the three has to be a elected official so that that's really the ground rules you have to comply with the only reason i ask is in terms of appointment for presiding officer committee and for appointment and recommendation of a council member it's an ad hoc committee that's done one way of presiding officer it's a regular committee it's done the statute i believe is 218 44391 2 references the elected official and the elected official would be that i believe would be the chairman of the this committee i think what we have in hebrew fighters i remember reading it is that hang on say whatever you just said to him now what the the requirement the elected official isn't the chairman it's selected by the group but there has to be an elected official on it it's it's been a change five years ago when we went for an auditor this wasn't in existence evidently and this staff did well now the statutes require that an elected official participate in this community some cities have two or three members of if they have applied institutions and i think the simplest way is just use the citizens advisory committee and select a concept member to be part of that committee our audit rfp just fyi is on the street right now it's the 19th it's due act to us so i just wanted to clarify something it says in here that the committee members elect the chair the member of the council that's on the committee does not automatically become the chair of the committee is that correct that's what the um this says yes the statue requires the elected official that i may have misspoke just to be honest but the chairman of the committee doesn't ask elected [Music] that's not in here mr raleigh is that an acceptable ad if i can get the council to uh there's only seven of us here that are in the running and we're all here tonight to speak on our own behalf there's if i can get an amendment to this and you think that for tonight you can okay so will somebody would like to amend this to have that we will appoint the council representative this evening and number 15. [Music] [Applause] the amendment is simply to leave number 15 intact the way it is except that we will appoint the council member tonight or on get a volunteer tonight from the council so that we fully staff this committee we have the rest of it done and let this way we can move forward with the committee so yes vote we'll move this thing forward take this via voice vote all in favor of the amendment only all right anyone opposed okay so we're going to make the appointment tonight council we have any more discussion on the uh on the so this is consideration of resolution and then we'll look at the appointment if this passes we'll do the appointment right afterward and we'll so um we'll actually do both appointments just to make it for you um consideration of resolution 202104 a resolution of the city council the city of belleriver beach florida establishing an audit committee providing for membership of the audit committee providing for the selection of chair providing for duties and responsibilities thereof providing for meetings and providing for an effective date a yes vote establishes this committee all in favor aye is there anyone opposed mayor mayor yes mayor can i get a a roll call on this sure of course okay so that votes invalid we're gonna go to roll call clerk council member banker aye councilmember gunn aye councilmember noterow aye councilmember swope aye council member aki aye vice mayor gattis mayor manzo all right so it still passes seven to zero and so the committee has been established um now to appoint everyone so the we've already said that the citizens advisory committee is going to make up these spots so the five members will be sitting on this we now seek for uh anyone who wants to nominate themselves or someone else on the council is going to be council only i'm going to nominate myself folks and i'm doing it simply because of my background so i have uh i'm a cpa inactive i've been since 1982 worked for deloitte and i've worked with auditors for many years in both my capacity as accounting manager at some incorporation of american returns in transit and also privately as a cpa and i was active until i went to law school and i became an attorney but i still have an inactive license so i'm actually a licensed cpa i just don't practice anymore and i can't practice officially but i can renew that license so i have quite a bit of experience in this and i'd love to get by give it to the city to help you out on this one anyone else i would like to nominate councilmember leslie montoro any other nominations will you call you on goal vote is that the best way to do this you need four yes um i don't know can you nominate from out there nominations come from the council on an ad hoc regular committee asking if it was an ad hoc kind of like a draft you you just did an amendment where you as a council stated that or amended the resolution so that you would name one of the seven of you to be the elect to be the representative so i would say the the result or the the nomination needs to come from the council not from the citizens at large i will open it up if anyone wants to speak foreign jody shirley 207 harrison avenue i just i know that uh flynn gun has had a lot of experience in the past on budgeting and assisting with strategic planning and i would love to see him as a member of the committee those are my languages thank you thank you anyone else from the citizens bring it back to council uh i'll nominate plenty okay i'm glad you accept the nomination yes sir and we now have three individuals in the running for this anyone else we need four votes madam clerk we have leslie montero glenn gunn and myself council member banker councilmember gunn glenn council member notaro councilmember swope councilmember aki jillian vice mayor gavis mayor manzo joseph manzo we have three votes for glenn gunn two votes for me and two votes for leslie motero so we do not have a winner and i wish to withdraw then we do not have a winner you need four votes i've done withdraws second vote leslie deteron myself councilmember banker councilmember gunn leslie your turn council member in otero council members council member akin joseph manzo so the votes five to two leslie terrell will be the council representative this committee convenes immediately mr reeves or like yes uh excuse me uh as soon as we get the honor back our audit rfp fact we'll compile them and you know to the committee because that will be their first when will we make the decision on council when is that expected well they'll review the proposals they'll make a recommendation to the to the council and after that's done then they will short list depending on the number of people and then the short list will come to the city council and make the final decision do you have an estimated date for that it's really going to depend on how many i'm hoping in uh right now i think the date i've got is i'm open to the july first week meeting to do the presentations just depending on how much we get and how fast i can get the community together and this fee will be integrated into our new event to our new budget correct yes yeah yeah it's well it's not for the new budget it's for the current year budget they will audit let's talk about their fee because we're going to know those proposals with the rfps okay so as long as you're perfect okay wonderful anybody else have any questions move to item 16 um recap of the florida league of cities 2021 institute for elected municipal officials it's called emo2 councilmember gunn requested this this is a recap of key learning points recommendations and best practices first let's just have yes on april 23rd through the 24th i attended the second training revolution for the institute of elected municipal officials it was held over daytona it's a gathering of maybe 30 40 people from the different municipalities and the florida league of cities brings in special speakers and that sort of thing it serves as a great basis for networking with other municipalities and sharing experiences as well as best practices that sort of thing they had some very good speakers with a lot of municipal governing experience as city managers as financial directors and human behavior there were only four major topics that they discussed during this time one was effective council techniques group dynamics decision making models media relations with it the second segment was on planning growth and management basically planning and zoning and comprehensive plans for the city the the third topic was advanced revenue and finances for cities and it was interesting because the guest speaker and the leader of those discussions was a fellow by the name of kimball adams who is actually the finance director for our neighboring sister city of largo here and he works on the board of directors of the florida league of cities and has a lot of experience as an adjunct professor within florida south florida's south university that sort of thing and the last thing was building your city's team personal labor issues obviously some of this stuff didn't apply necessarily to us but it's a great opportunity and just a uh i think to bring up some some thinking i'll just hit on some of the topics vice mayor also attended and he may have a different perspective by all means chimed in a place fair i really think there's something i missed one of the things we picked up on right away was uh less than half the cities in florida had tournaments it was interesting because we just went through this with our charter review and it was interesting because some of the cities that don't have term limits are working hard to get them and then other cities that do have term limits are working hard to get rid of them so it's just kind of an interesting take on how things were going and obviously the uh the two competing thoughts are well you know you don't want to get stagnant to people in there and seeing ideas all the time you want to get fresh ideas and fresh blood in there while at the same time you may not have interest in the people in the community to come forward and take on the roles and responsibilities as an elected official so that was just a good good thing there the use of workshops to build teams and work on improving the dynamics the takeaway for that is what we see and uh uh witnessed here in our own groups is is nothing new all cities and municipalities go through the same thing you get heated passionate outbursts you have very heated discussions uh some nights you walk away saying boy i wish i hadn't said that and uh there are other nights where you say that was a good night and we accomplished a lot so it was interesting hearing all these things interestingly the big cities the little cities what you find is they all have the same issues the same problems the only thing that changes are the names of the people involved in the dollar values and the issues of the project it was very interesting some of the best practices i'll just hit on real quickly managing the council agenda to be strategic he developed those things at the workshop have the discussions come up with a consensus that plans that when you get into things like the regular counsel section it's just one item after the other you kind of know and if there's there's some extra thought or something like that you can carry on and expedite business one concept that's going on uh is as you see the changing dynamics on our journalism and social media the interaction of news reporting that sort of thing cities are more and more becoming their own news source and they're doing that with their websites they're doing it with social media so that's that was just the best practice that was taken away from that so far as a comp plan the comp plan establishes the public interest for us and it was very interesting how closely that aligned with the strategic plan the the biggest thing there is the comp plan is more narrowly focused however the strategic plan basically sets the same thing what's what's the vision for the city what are the goals what are the objectives how are we going to get there so the comp plan is supposed to be reviewed every seven years and i believe we're probably coming up pretty closely and i think uh the existing call plan was reviewed back in 16 and it goes as far as 20 is that right it's it's actually the process that started already uh let's see a lot of talk about finance versus fees versus taxes and revenues the the takeaway there was that people are much more willing to line up for fees they understand hey it's a very narrowly focused provided money and in exchange for this service or this deliverable from the city taxes can be very nebulous and people don't necessarily see the benefits of that so the takeaway the best practice was to go ahead and review their fees on a a very recurring basis understand what you can get away what you can take away what you need to bolster and on no less than an annual basis you should be reviewing your fees if you paint a road but it looks like it needs it then you've waited too long and it comes down to the strategic plan the goals the objectives the capital improvement right it's a family of plans and we need to really make sure that those things are well aligned if your revenues are not increasing [Music] then they're decreasing it's it's not focusing on revenues at the expense or the blind eye of expenditures but you really need to understand your revenues and if you are not increasing your city's revenues then they are essentially declining yes charge impact fees we're seeing that more and more i mean we do work and then we have to turn right around and do it again at the expense and again you know understand what's the cost of doing business we paint the road we plan for it we do it and then right behind somebody comes in to renovate a home or something and we absorbed the calls back to beginning that road so impact fees i think that's something that we will probably pitch at our newest depth advisory committee and the review will probably have some good discussions on that sort of along with the fees examine the options you can stop doing something you can reduce services and the best practice is to reduce them incrementally you can raise the current fees you can implement new fees and you can or you just do a combination a little bit of all of those things improvement is a continuing process [Music] vice mayor i miss anything anymore no i'll just uh echo what you said about term limits uh surprisingly the florida league of cities is pro uh i'm sorry against term limits and i think the reason why what they were telling us is that the longer someone is in office the more influence that they can have and they have better knowledge and they just get to know people i so say who would make a mistake but it was interesting to hear another one also there were there were some comments made about when and where council members should appear i'll go into that later in a work session but it's one of those things if i don't bring it up in the next work session i would like someone to remind me because based upon their opinion we may not necessarily be doing everything exactly the right way is that a good way to say that other than that i think he pretty much covered most of it because the focus was really for food groups i'll just close with two comments one is yeah the florida league of cities kind of sees that i i think we're off to a good start here with our new uh advisory committee because what that what that allows us to do is we continue to build continuity we're bringing together a group of high-powered individuals with uh with a lot of uh diversified business skill sets and thinking we built a good brain trust it's a good starting place we leave the decision making with the elected officials but we come and go and with term limits that's going to become possibly problematic who knows but we will always have that advisory committee to provide the continuity and the brain trust for us and be up to up to speed on all the issues and how those things wire together and help cover that sort of thing the last thought i have is that i highly recommend this training the the first phase is the the ie01 and that's a great foundation for for elected officials the cities 101 gives you a great foundation for understanding budgets what fees are taxes are capital improvement plans you learn a language it's really a laying up for learning the new language of municipal administration and of course all these just continue to build on one another so for my fellow council members highly recommended thank you thank you and council members have any questions any citizens questions and that'll conclude that we move on to 1917 which is unfinished business is there any unfinished business i have unfinished business talking about term limits and citizens unanimously passed term limits back in november of 2020 and as of the last time i looked it's still not enacted on our books so can i get a status of that please actually give you that tonight i'm asking for it now we just received our letter from the florida department of state and acknowledging that they had filed our amended charter so once we received this now it's effective that's effective yes so it's effective out of the date of that what was the date of that letter well it's dated the 22nd but we didn't receive it until um i think was the was postmarked the 27th i i think it was received on thursday or friday i don't have the exact date so can you all agree that it's like 30th or may 1st versus saturday so today well it's affected the date of the letter we just didn't get the letter ourselves okay so it's effective yes council session then we'll be operating under those rules now the other charter amendments from the last election the council election march those are pending those have been sent to munich so we're waiting for them to uh get that together and send us our proofs excellent that takes care of my unfinished business anyone else any citizens of anything that we missed okay go to city attorney greg raleigh your report city manager lynn reaps just quick updates and probably some of you got it in city news but uh 7th and 8th street that project is complete we'll be moving on to 12th and 13th for the design there are still some outstanding things that they've got to repair but the project in total is complete and we'll be removing the dock or out the quotes for that because it's damaged and then we'll reopen the boardwalk or the uh program the boat ramp's going to be open irrespective of the dock right right after you do the demolition of course right right yeah we've got to close now because we don't want somebody to go out on that dock and hurt themselves uh as you all know the painting is done we're having a walkthrough with the contractor on thursday so we'll discuss a couple of those issues that jody brought up and there's a couple things the county's got to do with some sewer rings like at the end of 22nd street they've got to add a ring to the sewer cab uh and they're you know some negligible spots we've got to look at the work session for the code kind of give us direction to start on that so we'll get started on a few of those changes and bring it back to you the checks went out last friday for all the prepays except uh four of them and those were phones that were sold so i've got the attorney looking into that who gets the money the previous honor or the new homework and we'll start the adjustments to the assessment so the rest of the owners that paid an assessment will be getting production uh the council members but we shouldn't get that reduction i'm just kidding so so uh the amortization schedule's got to be approved by the bank but i think that's just a formality and uh i know everyone's heard about the red american rescue plan and this 600 i think it's 78 thousand dollars that miller beach is supposed to get we're following that we still haven't got any direct clarification of what it can be used for and what it can be used for we submitted we've got all the information the floor league's been trying to keep us appressed we've got all the information uh actually today we submitted to the florida league um our duns number our tax id the point person and stuff like that so uh they keep talking may 15th but we'll find out and hopefully may 15th they'll give us more clarification because really the answers are all over the place a lot of the examples state i think it's getting like 23 million dollars and they plugged it into their budget well what can we use it for can we use it for infrastructure use important things which would help the city so we'll find out uh his more detailed comments but i just want to give you an update we've done our due diligence [Music] i'll talk to the contractor right i don't have any to my knowledge there's no reservation for bell or short for this use of this building so i will tell you that in the past i will tell you that any government agency that's asked to use our facility or vice versa we give it to them complimentary we've never charged another government agency for that um and i think that's everything because someone has a question will you address those you don't have to lose now but will you address the other comments that um john hansen and debbie maul directly with them if there's anything yeah i'll talk to ryan and i'll see if i can get a copy of demi's synopsis that way i can make sure i cover everything [Music] um are we going to remove the dot because the dot's in good shape can that be removed from its pilings and place some place or are we going to demo the pilings are in bad shape and part of the docs broke underneath so we're just going to remove it and we have some estimates and we're put an estimated number in the budget for next fiscal year to replace it and at the same time we'll start maybe a savings thing like we've done with other things in the city so we don't get hit so far [Music] is any plans on putting any kind of lines or anything on our streets i don't i don't know if it needs it but the only place we're looking right now well it's because it's black because it's it's new the only place that there's a requirement is the bridge if we we're going to let the pass ball to cure a little bit before we do that because fdot inspects that bridge and we have a bridge report every time every other year they come out with something and we've got some work we'll have to do on that bridge but it's that's probably where it's yes yeah you had a you know the curb lines and you had the center line on the bridge okay and uh also how did the island in the cul-de-sac reconstruction how did that work out they've already broken peace out but we'll get that taken care of i think we can repatch again we're going to keep colors around for a little longer they drove over the back was it too soft too fast i mean i mean we had cones there and they drove over the cones so usually concrete's usually about 28 day cure before it really gets hard and of course this didn't get 28 days secure before they drove through the bombs been chipped a chunk out on the edge about probably about that big but it's done and hopefully it has some effect with the neighbors that we're concerned about all right thank you i have something yes um question two questions actually on this budget i just happened to see the tennis courts did they go over budget no it went under because if the year to date actual was actually out versus the budget or am i reading this wrong h2 oh there is a the 20 000 that was rolled over was not put in there yes so it's actually happening all right and then second kind of going back to what uh deborah mull and kansas were saying about the sheriff at that zoo call with the sheriff i asked him to give us uh an estimate of what beller shore uses versus what we do so we can see still it's never gotten back to us well i i got some information back and i i need to find out what numbers are right because i got something back from the sheriff and currently we get a critter of 35 000 and 35 093 and that's based on population and uh they're using the previous population which sort of benefits us but but in any case and then they did a study by calls for service and they gave me 562 calls in the city of bellar beach and 25 calls for service from beller shore i need to because the symbol has told me something differently uh they did tell me uh and this was verbally that a lot of the calls that are made are from our residents even though they're in valor shore so they're i guess they're calculating this is you know i guess somebody's in the parking lot somebody calls you know and if that happened if they went by the calls for service we'd only get a credit of 22 000. and if we look at the crime factor and i don't know how they have accumulated these percentages but we'd only get a credit of 21 000 uh i i will tell you that i would you know we'll we'll talk to the sheriff some more because what mrs mall said i want to understand what these numbers are based on what she said and then the other question um what if we say we want our full-time sheriff which means our current uh contract go up 35 000 and it would only be devoted to us uh and where this part-time share for fellow shoreline go to could be picked up by one of the other cities or what have you so that's that's another option if we're concerned that we're spending but you have to remember that all sheriffs go both places as an example if we get a call here sheriff from bellaire loves to come here as a backup uh so you know it's it's kind of how the system works it's we're getting more uh police presence than one sheriff's deputy in a lot of cases now i get that i think it goes back to well they get 45 minutes a day or whatever shift but they're actually using two hours then they need to pay for it right and and we can tell the sheriff if that's what the consul wants to do well that's what we need to figure out like what are they actually i mean if it's 50 minutes they're paying 45 and they get 50 minutes okay you know but if it's i'm substantial they're eating twice as much so if they're getting like buy one get one free essentially that's i'm not into that yeah and you know the sheriff can come back and say what you could you can come back and say we'll take them away from you and you'll have your contract as it is i can't tell you if that's what he's going to say but that's a possibility and then our contract would automatically go up and that would separate us from dollars and we're also not budgeted until you go up that kind of increase are we part it's not in our budget to even though of that kind of an increase well no we we'd have to do that at the next budget cycle which is october 1st because our current contract shows that in there but what i think we need is options if we stay how we are if we separate if they pay their fair share of what they're using we need to have like those three options and then we can make a well that's when they do nothing but we need to have options and it's all about just gathering information so we can at least appease the residents because i agree with them it's annoying if we're paying the sheriff to police us with a baby's umbrella and then i don't even think an umbrella or a hood on a chair is allowed because that's still a shade so i mean yeah like i said i'm just giving you that information that was provided by the sheriff so he calculated it in how we would pay and he's willing to calculate it you know any way you want i i mean that's that's what he's basically told me so he's saying if you want to calculate it by calls then this is how you know they'll have to provide something that says how many calls are made by that are sure and how many calls were made by dollar beach which according to this he told me uh it was it came from their fiscal bureau and he said there were 562 calls by bellar shore and 25 urban 562 by feller beach and 25 by a dollar short they also have to take into consideration when they're patrolling the beach and spending seven ten minutes telling a citizen to take down their baby's umbrella even though nobody calls all that that's still part of their time so i mean i think those numbers are not a fair representation of what's actually happening if you take all of the aspects in and that's what i want to know is how much of that 45 minutes is being used on umbrellas or how much of it is being used for belair shores interests versus ours or how much more do they get well i'll ask you further and ask you know including the beach patrols that aren't necessarily from a call because they're supposed to be patrolling the beaches every once in a while as i'm understanding or do they want to go out there when someone complains uh i think they have a directed patrol maybe once a shift or something i mean we don't have any i don't uh assign a directive control for our beach unless i have a incident like somebody calls and says hey that dog's on the beach at 7 30 o'clock in the morning so i will ask the sheriff to do a directive patrol of the beach for that for you know a week or two just to see if there is uh actually happening on a daily basis because because i do hear you know from various people i've seen better shore residents watch them walk their dog on the beach i mean but you have to be very careful with uh dogs walking down the beach because there's a couple questions that deputy can ask them when it comes to if johnny says it's a service animal he can't ask him to produce anything he says so that's that's part of the law you know again it's kind of like the biceps bicycles are electric our ordinance says please have uh that's guys with your dog hanging out the beach well like i said that's that's you know law enforcement has to ask those questions but there's only a couple they can ask i don't know sheriff's sergeant switch could i ask him but maybe he can tell me we have time good evening again there are limited questions that we can ask out there i'm not going to try to regurgitate what it is right now because i'd have to go out and look at the specifics of it but he is correct there are two questions because of ada regulations so when we go out there they don't have to purdue we can't ask them to produce any type of identification that the dog is a service animal so we can ask them i believe what it is don't quote me on this is what specific function does the dog perform and they can tell us what it is and we have no way of knowing anything other than that so again we are we are limited on what we can ask out there when it comes to certain dogs on the beach and that applies to all the cities do you find that you're spending a lot of time patrolling the beach for shade ordinance purposes well you're asking the wrong sergeant on that because i work in the evenings like tonight six o'clock at night so i don't know i don't know what day shift does out there is there anybody can find out is that information that we can formulate as far as like that he spent seven minutes 10 minutes 12 minutes during the day on a saturday or whatever saying take your babies of roll off the beach or i have no idea of how they calculate the exact time that's out there i did hear obviously discussion about the deputies doing their beach patrols and there are directed controls that deputies do have to go out there at least once a shift however what i will say the deputy on my shift he will start at a specific location i don't know where that is and he will patrol from the northern northern end of the city all the way down to the south so that also would include beller beach he doesn't just specifically patrol beller shortly are you saying that it's a service animal it doesn't have to have any markings on it like the best paperwork that says that this dog is a service animal all i can tell you is what we are as law enforcement are limited on the questions we could ask we have not been told that they have to have any type of identification that identifies them as a service animal we can only ask two questions so the person that has the dog under and i love dogs i'm one of the biggest dog lovers i'm a volunteer in ellis county animal shelter but i never brought my dog to the beach and i see these dogs on the beach with a 16-foot leader i can't see that being a surface i see them with no reach okay well then we can get into other regulations i guess when it comes to leashes in that sense well if we're talking about dogs on the beach and they say it's a service animal we can only ask certain questions specific questions we can't go outside of that so you can't say they don't have the uh the next step would be to produce that historical service well i'm sure there are law enforcement officers out there that will cite and then i guess you could go the route of case law and everything like that but common sense hopefully we'll overrule that and then go based on what you're required to do because i'm a frequent beach belt i only really see the share of the children each on the weekends it's going for a long time today they see no control so i don't think there's much time to eat spent without our shores for monday through thursday maybe just curious of our relationship with baylor shore and contractual the relationship we have as far as police goes do you think that there's ever been a time where you were unable to fulfill your obligation to the city of bel air beach because of bel air shore no if if we were to separate the contract and we were to pay more and still contract with pinellas county would our level of service increase now i think that's outside my scope to even answer that question all i know is that as a law enforcement officer i come out and i bring i try to provide the best quality service that i can as a supervisor i reach out outside as was discussed earlier i will reach out i will respond if necessary as a backup or if they're busy i would be the one to respond if not mccorkle other deputies around the area so i really don't want to respond to that question because it's outside that's that's fine lastly if if the sheriff's department was unable to fulfill their obligation because of lack of manpower would they call in someone else to help i i would think that that's a that would be a nearly a disaster for that to happen because of the resources available to us our plenty we will call deputies from wherever we have to to come and assist whether that be from north county whether that be from over in pinellas park area i can't see something like that happening thank you very much uh a couple of questions you know you made a statement about how you're controlling me you pull patrol from the north end of the south and and i've got you know you kind of painted a picture of my mind it all kind of blurs together doesn't it i mean it's you're patrolling an area but i mean you don't see the demarcation between our shoulder i mean here you're just in the beach area well i myself don't go out there but i'm assuming my deputies do they don't draw a line in the stand that says that we're going to stop at 19th street and we're going to turn around and come back south they just drive the beach so so administratively i know you guys keep logs and shifts you gotta fill out the paperwork and stuff is that is there a lot detailed enough to break down whether or not hey i did a uh a house check for better shore or your house check with verona beach i mean are the logs detailed enough that somebody could go back and order them and say okay well actually you spent this much time working down the shore versus miller are the vlogs detailed enough for that well there are detailed logs for specific events so in other words driving the beach and asking somebody to remove a shade structure as they're driving along the beach there should be a log of that if they're pulling the number for the ordinance violation itself however if it's nothing more than in passing please take down the structure and then continue driving house checks directed patrols those will be locked i know those are official probably department uh documents do we have visibility on on your logs or at the end of the ship can we get a copy of it absolutely no councilman i witness on the weekends again the sheriff goes as far as 28th street indiana's beach makes a u-turn comes back and then is okay that would be clarification so yes we have deputies that patrol the city of indian rocks beach and obviously a deputy that patrols beller beach and ballard shore so that deputy will not go into clear water as a matter of routine nor would that deputy go down to indian rock speech or vice versa as a matter of fact no no i understand that clarification thanks council do you have any other questions for the sheriff city manager sheriff thank you for helping clarify thanks and getting us information back to you okay that's it um we now move to the city clerk and before we move to the city of clercus what we've read before he had a chance to read it but we did a proclamation and it's the 52nd annual professional municipal clerks week from may 2nd through may 8th and it's really to honor all the work that uh professional clerks do for all the cities and of course we're honoring patti gentry as part of that so i'll be the first to say thank you for everything that you do for the city and a wonderful job i'm glad to have you so congratulations on this and the mayor's council is inviting all the clerks to join us for lunch on wednesday so hopefully you can make that because they want the first time they've ever done it on all the clerks for all their work so hopefully you can join us for that but uh let me say thanks first and i'll turn it over to you i'm sure the rest of the council will thank you thank you very much yeah no i have no other comments but thank you over the last few years honestly i think our hands will be tied without you you are invaluable to this city and uh we greatly appreciate all you do thank you very much thank you you're welcome patti is going to say you know you're absolutely amazing and we adore you and you do so much for everybody so you know how i feel about you thank you thank you i'm gonna go robin leslie in glen because i know everybody wants to speak robin patty you know we love you you're awesome i could have done this without you um i love how you always know all the answers to my questions and you always have a smile on your face it's always such a joy to see you because you're always happy it's funny so thank you for everything you do we really appreciate you oh thank you you're welcome listen just echo the same comments that everybody has made danny we're so lucky to have you thank you for everything you do and the small smile on your face oh thank you i'm done keep up the great work thank you very much yeah patty keeps me straight [Music] we're trying to keep each other straight yeah that's why but uh one thing i did forget to mention uh does a lot of work and uh she put out your latest edition of the city news and that's a new thing she's doing so you know she's adding to her repertoire along with the website and we did forget to mention patty's going to be on vacation the last two weeks in the day if we have any meetings i guess i'm your city class we're not going to make a big proclamation [Music] i'll just basically say the same thing everyone else did it as many times as i've worked with her she's exceptionally pleasant and she does one thing that i i very much appreciate every time the orientation is how do you solve the problem and that is absolutely vital from a city clerk and i'm very appreciative appreciative of you thank you thanks again daddy yeah citizens anything we know how you feel but go ahead met mark yeah mark you got you know what just so they can hear you then when we redo this we should have a microphone that like he shouldn't have to come up you know that should be something out there just the thought go ahead well more golden 22nd street uh i've known patty for a long time now and in my business life i've employed a lot of folks but i've never been honored to have an employee that does as much for folks with a smile on her face as patty does not only is she intelligent about any question and can answer anything you ask her nothing seems to be beyond her struggle and she has those answers your emails are returned your phone calls are taken i think we're just as a city we're blessed to have her and i hope you are here for a long time thank you mr goldman thank you anyone else john hanson 22nd street i echo what everybody else has said i've only been a resident for about five or six years i've been involved in a few things with the city and so forth but it's like every time i either come into the building or i've emailed patty she's always had the right answer always in a timely fashion and i really had a surprise a day or so ago she sends me an email out of the clear blue sky as a reminder of tonight's meeting i i have it even though i do periodically get crs i do know that the first one is a month of us it's a federal holiday we're heading with a meeting and she also had the graciousness to include the agenda packet so i had an opportunity to peruse it outstanding you rock a lady thank you anyone else all right thank you patty again all right go to city council comments this month we begin with i don't have any of the comments to me listen to tarot no comments am i done a couple quick ones congratulations to the newly selected members of the advisory committee we're looking forward to great great things interesting that the mayor brought up the polio back there because as a best practice typically a lot of it and it matters up on this victor i mean you see all the different council chambers typically the podium is back there by the citizens that make sense and uh along with that i'm looking at all these wires here and maybe it's time to join the 1990s and you have no bluetooth on some of this stuff with your wireless it's probably there because that's where the connections are for wires and stuff like that uh just a show of hands in the back house of sound quality is it an improvement okay so that didn't work out well one last issue is just a recommendation uh best practices possibly take it under advisement for future sessions is we call on the city attorney to sum up his conference or whatever and it's the only chance for us to get some visibility as to future actions so what what i would recommend or ask as a best practice for future sessions is just a summary of action items that you're possibly taking away from the meeting you know i've got a consensus here these are the action items i'm taking for for future work and billable hours more than anything so it just takes a takes 30 seconds 60 seconds off to say i've got this fraction i've got this reaction and i've got this fraction and these are the deadlines of the deliverable that i expect to give you this is the deadline thank you thank you yes last week uh we all received an email from a city manager about uh he's a citizen just a visitor about some beach problems navigation orders it's been one of my concerns it's been a concern a few of my neighbors from first street beller shores to 16th street buoys were removed i went to the city manager he says there's really no requirements so i looked into a little bit further i went to the county commissioners back in 2002 there was a permanent issue for 33 and they're not just buoys i mean we have a coast guard man here and i can probably tell you more than i know about cookies but these are safety rules they have idle speed no weight going up and everything like that some somewhere somehow they were removed up to the 16th and the boats come in at high rate of speed it's dangerous i don't want to get into litigation that the town that the city's facing right now someone who slipped and fell this is a hazard or so the original permit in 2002 was issued by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission i spoke to them today they're not sure there was ever a rescinding of that party they're looking into that and could get back but it clearly says it's a safety issue now i can't see 18 years later with more people coming to this area that we would reduce safety so i really think we should look at this because it's a permit that was issued there was a joint permit belair shores and belarus beach 33 booths right now there's about 17 movies i think we should look into that and uh i think we should address before somebody is seriously hurt that's all right is it possible maybe do you get can you get that to panic maybe get the copy of that out to us that uh what you're finding yes i can kind of speak to that back at that time just so the council knows yes the cities at that time went together and bought the buoys uh bellar shore paid for the installation of theirs and over time no one really tore them out and just break away and go somewhere else and pick them up later and they opted not to put them back we actually just replaced a bunch of art movies in the last 12 months because the permit is there so periodically we go around and have buoys you know because they break away and disappear and so and the current speaks of that breaking away disappearing damage run over which they need to be replaced and that's my question they haven't been replaced since what's that four years now well some of those foods have gone longer than that well i i really i mean there's 33 they got a longitudinal attitude that they have i think we go to variance and saying hey put one at third street sixth street 9th street just to keep the boats out because if you ever go on the beach at 6th street or 12th street you can watch him maybe at 12th street you'll make a left-hand turn or come flying in 28th street will make a right-hand turn flying and i've had him come right up i i've got pictures i can show you i mean i got pictures set for me it's it's a mess and it's just and especially with watersheds they come in at a high rate and it's not in bellar beach it's not in the new rocks beach it's just between 16 so am i hearing you want us to check about putting buoys at those three locations well i don't know if you can do it we'd have to just get a variance first to see if we can do a longitude lag to those three locations because what would the cost mean for any locations well no the the buoy companies we just give them what's on the permit and they don't put them well if the current permit is enforced there's 33 movies that have to be in place and there's not there's only 17 right that's the ones in god yeah there's our beaches here miller beach has their foods but isn't that their jurisdiction if they're saying hey we don't want to do this i don't know if we have any right to tell them yes you have to probably know the department does berman says they must have to be replaced okay then yeah let's get this out and let's all take a look at it including fred riley yeah for the most part the permits louise you establish a map and you pick the spot you want and then you submit that for official wildlife and they do approval for the department if you add buoys you have to update it but for the most part their lifetime i don't know that there's any requirement that and you know i'll have to go back underneath the permit i've looked at it recently but i don't know that there's any requirement that you have to put them back but we do it because we have an ordinance that says 100 yards from the shoreline it's a safety zone you can't do that same in the intercoastal we do them there and so does bella shores has the same just about the same lord smith language in their uh it's 100 yards from the shoreline and as the fish and wildlife says well without a buoy how do you ride control them and uh when you talk to the sheriff's department they said yeah it does look like it's 100 feet but how do you control you know there's nothing there to warn the boater get out [Music] okay thank you robin no comments hey guys i'm good thank you i'm also good um so our next we don't have a fun schedule meeting we have our work session that we're planning for this month at this point it's open it's open okay that's why i made the comment that is going to be on vacation right so 2pd tournament's probably not going to happen okay we do have a park and record meeting on may 12th wednesday may 12th at 3 p.m here so that's it uh i'll entertain a motion to adjourn good night everyone thanks for coming"
