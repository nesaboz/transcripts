president board member Fred ellia here board member David Gardella here board member Tony gatliff here alternate board member Gerald Wisa here Vice chair Jane Mason Goldman here chair Mike Kelly here city manager Kyle weer here and Alternate board member Mark Mariana was unable to attend thank you Benny our first item on the agenda is the approval of our September 14 2023 Board of adjustment hearing I'll entertain a motion to approve move thank you Mr Beam second thank you car all in favor accepting the mo the minutes as presented please say I I oppose motion carries at this time I'd like anybody in in the room who would would like to speak tonight to please rise and be sworn in by our city clerk do youly declare or affirm that the testimony you about to give in these proceedings is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I do thank you at this point I'm going to read the rules and procedures that this board will follow tonight there's uh quite a few of them but it's in a very procedural U method that we listen to what the application is what the variant requests are and that we as a board voter so I will read the various requests tonight we have three so I will read them one at a time after at which point we will receive a staff report from city manager K Brier then we'll ask the applicant to come forward and make a make a presentation after we have open discussion with the board and the applicant and with the city manager we will move on to our mandatory criteria items 1 through six which are six questions that the applicant have to answer and fill out in order for our board to hear his case or their cases tonight after each of the six questions we'll vote and Patty will give us a roll call after the final criteria question is asked we will ask for a motion to approve or deny that variance and again our city clerk will read the will call call the [Music] RO if there's no questions at this point I'd like to move forward with our first variance request request number 23-10 consideration of a variance request at 11663 fora Mayo trustee and Charlene Mayo trustee the Mayo trust living trust requesting of variance in chapter 90 which is our subdivisions chapter in so far as practical a subdivision sideline shall be at right angles to the Straight Street lines and Radial to the curved Street lines an irregular shaped lot shall have at least a 75 ft width at the shortest building line on curve Lots such Dimensions shall apply to the AR measurement to allow the so the request is to allow the minimum lot width along the arc measurement of 10.03 Ft shorter than Allowed by the city code P this point I'd like to ask you have we received any in correspondence whatsoever um on on the variances um that we're hearing to yes sir I did receive two emails opposing the variance and those were sent to the board and I put them at your seat thank you did the board receive the emails got each of them thank you very much Kyle the floor is yours You' like to present our various information thank you chair Kelly uh Kyle reer city manager b beach so the applicant um turned in a sketch of the proposed lot uh division they're trying to accomplish through this variance hearing um I sent it to engineer Larry floody with Gemini engineer Ing and he uh first reviewed the uh subdivision uh chapter 97 division section 912 Lots subsection B uh where it talks about the minimum um minimum lot withd at the line at the shortest building line can it must be a minimum of 75 ft uh he determined the proposed lot which on the sketch is labeled new Lot B um to have a lot with at the shortest building line of 81.3 Ft um that does not require variance per the code but the first variance that is requested is for the sketch of new lot a which um is described in the engineering report as parcel area covering lot a and a portion of lot 15 that he took the the line at the at the building line um and the arc measurement and that came to 64.9 7 ft um the code minimum is 75 ft so as requested in the variance it is short 10.03 ft and then you'd like me to cover the other two yeah I'm going to ask you at this point so basically the math as we are um receiving these various requests that the math for this was done by Larry our C engineer correct okay if everybody got a copy of the engineer's letter put it all together mathematically to see why we're at 10.3 etc etc etc on board okay let's do the second and third because it's all simple okay so subsection C is the minimum size and it reads a residential lot in any development in the city after April 20th 1990 shall not be smaller than in in area than 10,890 sare ft this subsection shall not limit the right to rebuild on existing platted on existing platted Lots so when the engineer Larry floody reviewed the area of the proposed lot divisions um the new lot be which is described as parcel area covering Lot B and a portion of lot a um came to a total area of8 or 10,840 Square ft and the code minimum States 10,890 Square ft so that lot would need a variance uh for the 50 ft Square ft is short in area and then the other lot which is new lot a on the sketch provided in the application which engineer describes as parcel area covering lot a and a portion of lot 15 that lot area uh or parcel area was calculated to be 8,96 square ft um and that is short of the minimum of 10,890 Ft by 1,984 ft so that that would require a variance um to be for that lot to be short in area of 1,984 Ft thank you Bo any questions for Kyle no is there anyone in the audience who would like to ask any questions of go Mr Sil I would ask a question Kyle I think I mentioned to you last time we spoke we can ask the applicants do we know what the plans are for this property are they tearing the existed home down and building two or selling one building one do you know anything about I spoke with the applicant's attorney and asked um if these variances were granted um would they be demolishing the existing structure on the property and she did acknowledge that if they get the variance that that that was the plan so and and that the the client would be willing to uh agree to a timeline to do so Mr S I don't know what your procedure is but on stand sopur I live at 117 fth Street wife Caroline been there 30 years this is the third time that we've seen an attempt to convert the property into different sections Mr so would you explain in relationship to this laot where your home is directly behind this property subject property thank you so we have put the uh property in question thank you um what I don't know is uh city manager mentioned that there was a sketch I've not seen any sketches so all I have is what you have sent from the city uh reducing size so I'm looking at numbers not looking at the overview as to what they're trying to accomplish other than splitting up a very nice piece of property but my basic concern is that has been turned down before because in order to build on two lots especially the lot that has been described it'd be like putting a matchbox on stills um you have many beautiful homes in the 30 years I've been there we have seen many beautiful homes built most of the ones on the water are way over a million even the ones that are not on the water are close to a million the property that you're talking about here could not come anywhere near that and would be an eyore to the neighborhood it would change the density of the community community looks good right now I'd love to see another house on that lot wouldn't bother me at all but to chop it up make it into two lots you're going to have a very small piece of a property which would be very foolish to put in there I don't know if the people intend to live there or just build another house and move back to California where I believe they're from I think that would be unfair question for you since we have several other variants in here do I have to speak on each one we we'd like to ask you to come back at this point we kind as he finishes his report we're going to hear for the applicant next okay I still like to see the was refer to you answer your question Mar this the sketch is were part of the application and sketches and you can see a andul thank you have any more questions for is the applicant present or applicant's representative here welcome to the podium thank you um Jamie mayor off from Hill Ward Henderson 600 CL Street sorry I'll address this first 600 Cleveland Street sweet 800 in Clear Water I have been sworn and I'm representing the applicant um I think my presentation will probably address the questions that have been asked but I'm also happy to answer questions of course um afterwards I'm going to provide one presentation if that's all right with the board I know there's three items but I that's okay we' like to do it all once we'll vote on individual right and I can incorporate my statement for the record or anything that needs to be done um proed so this is the subject property um it's the one outlined in red as you can see it's an oversiz lot um it's almost double the minimum required square footage under the code for a new lot and it's over double the minimum lot width the 75 ft minimum so it's almost twice the size it needs to be this is the survey of the existing property and as you can see it's actually a combination of 2 and a half platted Lots so it's all of platted Lots A and B of one plat and half of platted lot 15 of an adjacent plat so most of the surrounding area has been built out in its platted condition so if it was platted as a 60ft lot it's been built as a 60ft lot and that is actually the majority of interior Lots since I'll show you in a moment um but somebody in the chain of record here didy up and combined and mixed and matched this slot and its neighbor which is smaller um and so you've got this huge lot so what we're propos osing is to split into two regular size Lots which will actually be um a little larger than their kind of comparable Lots in the area but will be smaller by a few as Mr reer explained um will be smaller than the code we require and so that's what we need the variance for the so I think just to address the gentleman's question and I believe that his lot is if you look at the new Lot B that's the corner lot his lot I believe is directly um south of that we're not proposing to make it easier question sh that um we're not proposing to basically reestablish this very narrow lot here because we have 30 ft of this lot tuo so the division is going to be bigger to New Lots than the way they were originally ploted I will note that if they had been built the way they were pled pled those two lots would have been as narrow as you see them right there but um the majority as you can see majority of the Lots on this plat are built that the way they're platted they're 6600 ft they're 60 ft in width in the interior uh the corner and Waterfront Lots Trend more towards 80 85 90 8,000 or so Square ft um so we're proposing basically a 65 ft so 5T WI average interior lot at 8,900 Square ft which is over 2,000 ft larger than your average interior lot and we're proposing a new corner lot that is about 80 ft in width and just 50 ft under the minimum code requirement of 10,890 this is again the area you can see most lots have been built the way they were ploted I'll zoom in this is is the again you've seen this in the plat but this is the way the interior locks have been built most of them are 60 ft by 110 so a lot smaller than what the code would require today and a lot smaller well a little bit smaller even than what we're proposing and here are some of those corner and water front Lots I mentioned where you can see they're a little bigger um and so the new corner lot that we're proposing is a little bit bigger or around the same size as these which maintains the consistency of the way that the area is platted uh and the way that it's been built we find that these do satisfy the variance criteria you've seen from the Aerials this site is clearly unique um relative to the Lots around it it's kind of a Frankenstein lot of 2 and A2 Watts it's the minimum deviation here to make reasonable use of the property because it was ploted two and a half lots are there ignore the half the way it was ploted two homes would be there if it had been built the way the rest of the neighborhood hood has been built out because those were platted buildable Lots so it's reasonable and logical to split this into two lots we're still going to have two lots that are bigger than the way it was platted they're just smaller than what the code required today um this doesn't confer any special privilege on the applicant it establishes rights that are very similar to what other property owners have it doesn't change the use I know that's one of the criteria it certainly doesn't change from anything other than single family and it doesn't change the density because it was platted 2 and 1 12 lots and right now it's one um the great thing about these New Lots is they'll be able to comply with all the zoning setbacks that apply to lots that are even smaller than them and um I know one of the code requirements is not asking for deviations from storm water or flood plane management um sections of the code and we're certainly not asking for relief from that um this house these are a few photos taken during the last storm that we had this house is old it's far from flood proof and so from that perspective it would actually provide a clean slate to better further the code in terms of flood proofing these neighborhoods as we get these storms more and more often so we respectfully request your consideration of approving these variance requests um and we're here for questions thank you are you there um board members any questions for the applicant I was curious same question I had asked Kyle U are there what are their intentions to liveing one or sell them both or so uh the African actually lives in dun Eden so he did buy a house he's not moving back to California um but he he lives in dun Eden he had bought this home and I can he can speak if if you prefer to hear from him but I I know you know he bought this property thinking about living there there's a tenant there now um but if this variance is approved yes he would be he knows he would have to demolish the home and honestly we he hasn't quite got further than that I think you know if you would like to add more detail that's that's about where we landed because you know we would have to get the variance approved before we could do anything if the gentleman would like to join you at the podium he's welcome to so if the variance is approved he doesn't know if he's going to make that his home cycle on one of the two lives well he already has a home so it won't I I don't want to speak put words in my client's mouth but no he wouldn't make one of those home site good evening Dan Mayo uh yes I'm I'm currently living in Den I bought a house there I building a house in so would not be moving into this this SL so both of these would be speculation either yes any other questions we're still working the personal Mr Sul if you care to come back up we're keeping this rather informal come on back and please State whatever information you'd like to provide one of the one of the items that talk about density right now just between my house my property and the one behind me which is one in question they change that to two properties then my house can be change to two properties now I don't even need a zoning variance so you would change density if that happens to four from two so I'm totally against any changes in that type situation based on the way the property is configured right now based on the neighborhood that is out there I did have one question the old rules used to be that every homeowner within 100 ft of the subject property for any change would be notified and I noticed there were 13 properties involved how many notices were sent out I didn't would answer that question I don't I don't have that in front of me but I can go check real quick that's okay but it's within 200 ft we do within 200 ft oh my goodness that's even better so you must bun okay thank you thank you sir Kyle I got a question for you if you don't coming back up since we're on variance number 10 tonight 23-10 our city engineer in that list of um calculations is showing for this particular case the Varian is only for 10.03 I presume that's Square ft no that's that's linear linear yes CU it's l area where you have to have 75 and we here under 65 okay so on the first case that we're going to do everybody understand that's all second case and again you're welcome to come back at any time um that's where we're looking for the 19004 square ft that's a square FR that's case number 2311 I got to listed at the bottom of his of his sheet 1,984 ft yeah so that that's at the bottom so yeah the way Larry's report is dra that's right and then the third one is also square foot 50 square ft below the minimum Cod yes that's it for now we'll keep going would the applicate like to come back there's no time limit here we're going to vote on them one at a time we're discussing them all right now that's great I'm used to dealing with six 10 minute time limits but I won't take even that much we do not have the clock running on you right now um this is good a slide as any I so I just want to reiterate the point that density I think isn't isn't an issue here you know we're not asking for like future land use map Amendment or anything like that that would increase you know allow single family to go to two family or anything like that and again this was platted Lots A and B could have been built they just they weren't built that way somebody amassed them and split that one lot straight down the middle I will note your code says the right to rebuild on existing platted Lots isn't prohibited um and so we're not reestablishing these platted Lots exactly the way that they were but again this was my point earlier this prior lot you can kind of see the faint line here that was a very narrow lot the way it was ploted um and we're not proposing to reinstate it like that and I believe this is the gentleman's property and I could understand a very small house would have to go here but this corner lot new Lot B is going to be an 80t lot with 10,840 ft so it's not going to be what this looks to me like easily a 60t lot or less I'm not sure that this lot could be divied up the same way is uh the applicant lot again he has almost 20,000 Square ft it's huge it's just 10% under the amount he would need to split it without a variance because he almost has enough so without a variance he could put if he chose to demolish side of the house he can put up the castle he yes he could split the lot uh record it with the property phaser and put up two houses or he could leave it and yes put one gigantic house on it I suppose but we're not asking you your decision sir he just saying that's an option he wants your Castle but no it's so again it's it's there easily could have been two homes here is the point so it's not you know changing something that was not intended because whenever whoever established this plat in 1946 they platted lot A and B and they ploted lot 15 and they plot of this Lot C and so these were all meant to be homes and so it's not asking for something that wasn't intended at the time that this whole neighborhood was established board members you mentioned something about both Lots would be almost you know approved but the one and again this is the next variance I don't want to confuse the issue but the next variance request is about 18 19% below minimum yes so the total the total lot itself like if you just ignore the division that we're proposing is about 10% underneath the if if you so the code requires 10,890 ft for a new lot you know absent all the plats that have been around for a long time so if you you know multiply that by two we're just about 10% under what that number would be however in order to maintain consistency and recognize the fact that this is a corner lot our surveyor allocated more of the square footage available to the corner lot because as you saw from the plat the interior Lots tend to be smaller and 60 ft so he um he's proposing the interior lot to be a little more narrow like a 65t lot because it would be strange just from the way Corner lots are the way the setbacks that apply are more significant so you lose a lot of property with the setbacks and as you saw in the pattern of the area your corner lots are there so we did didn't cut it straight down the middle cuz that just wouldn't be a really a compatible use and allocation of the square footage that's available to us and it also makes the corner a lot more desirable yes it would I mean I think there's a 25t set back on either Frontage and so I think that's why you see these Corner lots are a lot bigger because you have to build your house you know farther in okay and I will just make a note to the board members I mean on this particular Street uh lots are 60 65 wide however on Seventh Street you got next block up got three properties that are similar to this with you know multiple Lots with one structure on it side by side on the south side of sth you got an oversized lot that's nearly two lots on the other side of seventh then there's even a similar lot on a street you've got an oversized lot directly to the west of the applicant l but now AR they like 90 80 or 90 yes they've got 15 30 ft L 15 yep they have got the other 30 ft that will they we can't get it from um yes that's correct so that's the other one what I was saying somebody obviously owned all of those and split it through lot 15 for whatever reason they don't have even close to the amount of square feet that we have though I mean what we have is is unusual like I said it's almost double what would be required today well over double what these Lots were ploted at if you split it in half ladies and gentlemen anything to go through before we move on I want to read one uh paragraph that's on our application for variance and for everybody in the audience to understand that these six criteria questions that we're going to go through when you apply for variance you would presume that you can get yes answers to all six of these the procedure is if you don't get all yes answers to all six and one of them even any one of them is uh voted down the variance itself is denied so it is in our um rules it says if the board determines that any one of your answers to the six individual criteria question list of the application is insufficient in nature and reason to earn a yes vote by a majority of the members that are present at this meeting your variance request will be denied it's not a majority rule on um three of four of the six or five of the six it's any one that is denied the variance is whole variance tonight at this point I'm going to turn the meeting over to the vice chair Jane Goldman who has more voice than I do tonight and could be so kind as to read our voice read our questions I'm happy too thank you thank you all for your participation tonight and your input we're going to start with the first variance um 2310 and we are going to go through each question the first question have you demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District yes is the Varian is approved no the Varian is denied paty Mr Beam no are you voting on this excuse me are you voting on this yes oh I raised my hand earlier after this CH would you like to speak absolutely you're more than wel to come in sorry for not recognizing okay maybe I didn't raise it high enough okay I'm Mr Balwin I live directly across the property sir would you pull the microphone down cuz we're recording this okay well I'm having the same problem with you with your microphone uh I live directly across the street from him from that property on 6 Street I'm 19 6 Street and twice I tried to acquire that property and twice I was denied not only by the city of b beach but also by the county of pelis I moved to b beach in 87 because I thought b beach was extra really special I think it still is however I also disagree with what you did on the previous Street I think our city is starting to become stacked up trailer par you're going to stack up mobile home one on top of the other because the the land is so narrow well he has a beautiful lot a beautiful home can be built on that lot far to exceed what he is proposing now I don't care to look at what he's proposing CU I know what it's going to look like so this is going to affect also my property value I concur with this gentleman here also he is behind it I'm facing it and I totally go against what you're proposing my fans a few years ago was a foot and a half off the property line the city made me relocate that property that fence I beg with you people to leave it alone for the time and you said no I can't tell you how many thousands of dollars it cost to relocate the fence and the Landscaping but I did it I totally go against what you're what is being suggested here because of our city I think it could be nice or already to my left there's two houses that were pre fabricated houses there was some also on on Harbor Drive that were prefabricated houses you're correct they came in on cranes right right and it doesn't reflect the Ambiance of this city I'm sorry thank you well thank you very much for coming tonight appreciate your comments Madam Vice chair we're going to start again on this one this is varius request 2310 the first question is have you demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same district so a yes vote will be approved oh I'm sorry yes yes variance approved and no the variance is denied Mr Bean no Miss conry no Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella no Mr gatliff no Miss Goldman no Mr Kelly no six no one yes the second question is have they demonstrated that the variance requestes the minimum variance that would make possible the reasonable use of the land building or structure yes variance is approved no variance is denied Mr Bean no Miss conry no Mr Alia yes Mr Gardell no Mr gatli no Miss Goldman no Mr Kelly no six no one yes number three have they demonstrated that granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this CH chapter yes is variance approved no is variance denied ready Mr Beam no Miss conry no Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella no Mr gatliff no Miss Goldman no Mr Kelly no six no one yes question number four was have you they demonstrated that the variance requested does not change the use of the property from the use characteristics mandated for districts 1 and two in sections 30-1 and 94-25 and Article 4 division 3 of this chapter yes variance approved no variance denied P Mr Beam no Miss conry no Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes pardon yes Mr gatliff no Miss Goldman no Mr Kelly yes Mr Kelly you said yes yes thank you question five give us a three yes four no and number five will comply fully with additional conditions and safeguards which the board of adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time Li limits within which the action for such a variance is required shall comment and are be completed yes variance approved no variance denied Mr Bean no Miss conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes six yes one no have they demonstrated that the variance requested does not violate any provision and requirements set forth in chapter 62 and chapter 74 of the city code yes equals variance approved no equals variance denied ready Mr Bean no Miss conry no Mr ellia no Mr Gardella no Mr gatli no Miss Goldman no Mr Celly no seven no okay anyone wants to make a motion would like to board make a motion make a motion please make a motion to approve or deny variance number 23-10 so is your is your motion to approve or to deny according to this it's going to be to deny p if I read it right we have one two three four five denials and two approvals that's not so following our procedures the motion is to Second motion P call the RO Mr Bean the motion is to deny yes vote would be to deny and no vote will be approve okay I just want to make sure you're a yes vote Yes is that correct P yes sir Miss conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatli yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes so variance request number 23-10 is denied with the applicance approval we'll move on to variance request 23-11 it is your decision or Sir Mr Mayo it's entirely up to you we'll follow the same procedure on the next two variances at your call I'm so this is actually the first jurisdiction I've been in where they separate all the variances out just do them all at once I mean to me it seems like you can't really have the others without the one that was our question is this cumulative is this right I don't see I don't think it's I mean mathematically I don't think it's if one's denied I don't see how if even if one of the others were approved it it's not you know we need all of the components in order to make it work so that that is our main question if you need all of them um our City attorney even ask me that he said um please ask the applicant should it come down to a need for the second and third it is entirely up to you because he thought you would want us to go through it but you have a right for us to withdraw that because you let me just confirm that with my but I don't think there's I don't think it would work we'll just go ahead and withdraw the please okay fty please it's it recorded already that at the applicant request they're going withdraw variance number 23-11 and 23-12 is that correct that is correct thank you very much there's any other visit before the board now we be the time to discuss it any comments any questions any inform any anybody in the audience who' like to come forward to the podium Mr Baldwin Mr suur it's entirely up to you basically I'd like to thank the board of adjustments for uh presenting a very nice opportunity for that individual I think what you guys did was very honest above board and I thank you for it while you're there Mr s Mr Bowen if there's one thing this board of adjustment is known for it's compassion and reasonability um we have had variances in the past that may have been excessive in what we call beyond the minimum request for variance and we worked with the applicant in the in the room at the time to compromise if if such a compromise could work in this case um there was three set variances and Kyle correct me if I'm wrong it appeared that all three of them needed to be approved for the foot for the footprint they wanted to establish to work correct that's correct on tape that's why we're saying yes we want we would have gone ahead and voted on the second variance and the third variance irre of what the decision was going to be if the applicant instructed us to do so thank you for your work thank you very much Mr Ser Mr BN thank you very much I you did a remarkable job thank you sir if there's no other business coming before the board I'll entertain with a motion to adjourn it was motion like five people thank you thank you everyone for coming we stand the J"
