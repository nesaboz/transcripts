    "transcript": "[Music] all right good evening everyone welcome to the monday may 3rd regular city council meeting of the city of bel air beach before we do the pledge of allegiance um a sad announcement to make this weekend a very good friend of mine and our neighbor long-term resident of bellar beach passed away his name is ron masara and if you were here last year you saw his girls do the they performed at the festival that came here and they were the first people to do the pledge of allegiance done very suddenly and it was real tragic so um i'm going to ask that we rise and observe a moment of silence for ron and for his family and for his children and keep him in your prayers if you're a praying kind of person as i know the family would appreciate that then we'll do that the pledge of allegiance thank you goodbye [Music] banker councilmember glenn gunn here council member leslie otero here councilman here vice mayor dave gavins here mayor joseph manzo here city

you please give your name an address and address the counsel anyone would anyone like to address counsel tonight john hansek and then debbie maul mr mayor yes just as an administrative uh remark here the city manager and his staff did some tweaking on the audio in here and perhaps uh people in the back if you have any problems hearing it or if you have any problems here i'm seeing thumbs up thumbs up on this side here just fine a lot of thumbs up okay so okay we got it it sounds good okay nobody ever has a problem hearing john hansen go ahead mr hansen there you go [Music] old drill instructor uh john hansen on 22nd street i actually have a compliment which i'll give second and brian which i'm going to give you first the complaint is contractors doing all of this utility work on billboard are using the vacant lot at the corner of gulf 22nd as a parking lot and a dump and i say dumb because the gentleman who owns the property and is in the process of getting his plans approved for construction comes around about every seven to ten days to cut his grass from the palm trees before you can actually cut that that lot the last two times he's had to pick up cones traffic cones and more importantly empty water bottles and trash now the compliment is to ajax plumbing excuse me um they completed paving 22nd of their hour estates and i would observe periodically them doing their job again drivers in the dump trucks well what was close to speed line the workers containing the equipment and doing the raking hydrating they picked up after themselves i'd like them to be told that that was appreciated and i'd like something to be done about all these contractors one the one in particular i see using quite frequently is that the contractor right they parker pick up trucks they go in there to get the destiny their place to do their thing and i know i i caught an earful this past weekend for my soon-to-be neighbor whenever he gets his prayers approved so it is private property it's not a public property so if something can be said do that contract award within the subs it would be most appreciated thank you thank you mr hansen mr reeves i'm going to refer this to you if you'll please if you if you care to speak about it later during your time you can um if not i'd like you to address it directly with mr hansen and the property lot owner he's correct this is private property thank you debbie mall hi i'm debbie mom i live at 115 boulevard and i just wanted to present two things i'd like you to consider first it's my understanding that we allow baylor shore to share our contract with the palace county sheriffs for our upcoming budget discussion this summer i'd like you to consider having ella's your contract on their own with the sheriffs uh these are my concerns first we paid uh first bellar store pays about seven percent of what we pay for our contract they pay thirty five thousand eighty eight dollars a year i believe according to their minutes and we paid five hundred and three thousand eight hundred and eight dollars according to our budget by bullying last month bellar store had 154 events as reported at their meeting by the sheriff's department and we had 717. that means we paid 58.55 per event while fellers are capable of 18 and 98 cents per event belair shore had about 17.6 of the calls but only paid seven percent of the total sheriff's budget i believe um that i read in their minutes in dollar shorts minutes that they gave her 45 minutes of sheriff's time uh i can't remember it was first shipped or based on giving them the benefit of the jobs and per shift in my calculations and they also stated in their limits that this was not even enough time to do all the house checks that they have scheduled so not only does this mean that the citizens tax dollars in delaware beach are subsidizing dollar store sheriff's patrol but that we the citizens of bellar beach are actually paying the shares to harass our citizens who put up umbrellas on our own access as well as for florida's public land i think our citizens were aware of this they would not be very happy about it so i'm asking you all including our attorney to look into the legality of this issue and to reconsider this for our next year's project in addition i know that the beller's hosting the bc meeting on july 28th at our own city hall i'm assuming that we're charging bellaire shore for the rental of our community center for this meeting since in the past we have denied our own local girl scout troop from using our community center without charge i think we have submit significant issues if we allow baylor shore to use our community center for free so i really would like to see that there's a contract for them to use our city hall in the past up to maybe five to eight years ago we have a good relationship with bel air shore but new people have moved in and things have changed we've maintained and upgraded the access and parking lots which i don't disagree with doing except that they allow to shore uh dollar store will allow significant numbers of construction vehicles to drive over the gate rails and parking lots and witness this first hand that creates additional wear and tear on the rails and the parking lot that we have to pay for we drive their homeowner's private beach property we do that kevin even our city manager had to get home owners approval for development beautification project from known citizens now i know that we got pinellas county money for that but they did as well so um i would just like um 207 harrison avenue i just want to um thank you all for actually kind of doing some awards that were spoken earlier about paychecks did a great job paying attention um we had an incident today that i think photos were emailed to all of you all that we had a concrete truck on here's an avenue that those pretty deep you know divots in the room uh i would just say in the future this is kind of why i've been preaching about impact fees and things such as that really taking a look at our comp plan i would say in the future that maybe we don't issue permits during the time we're paving because especially if it's a concrete trap we kind of reconsider you know the time allowance for that asphalt to harden before we we allow a concrete chart on on the road so just to fyi take a look at the email and some photographs if you've got some time to run by there but just something to consider in the future excuse me was that into the new painting that we've done absolutely i'm going to refer this to mr reeves and mr riley for follow-up they do damage to our property i believe you can pursue that i don't know what the circumstances were but it wasn't i'm hearing from jody shirley as it wasn't paid like that so okay any other citizens seeing no other hands on their closest and comments sheriff are you here to present we have pinellas county sheriff's officers sheriff good evening sergeant swift with melissa county sheriff's office for the month of march 2021 for the ucr property in person crime reporting there was a total of two incidents that were labeled as assaults i did look those incidents up one was a domestic battery and the other one was just a run-of-the-mill battery where the victim didn't want to prosecute for march of 2021 there were a total of three people arrested again one was for the domestic battery one was for a warrant and one was for the pui for that month also there were 713 total events and leading that was traffic enforcement in which 165 traffic stops were conducted and then in those 107 to 65 traffic stops a total well they must have been traffic stops and parking violations and 148 citations and warnings were issued and for citations issued a total of 10 citations were issued and the other were parking violations and then there were some voting stops along the intercoastal waterway also and then there were two crashes that were investigated in the city sheriff once again a fine job by the department here um i mean one of those incidents sounds like domestic violence which there's not much you can do other than react to it which you did it looks like um this is excellent you know i'm looking through the year here today we have six incidents in our whole city i mean there's people have six incidents in an hour so we've got six in a year a year today that's fantastic so my congratulations to everyone on the uh in the department and keep up the great work and as always thank you anyone else on council yes i'm done yes we just heard from this wall about that and the relationship is your officers basically manage the biller shores don't do the same shift correctly right is that correct so why can't we look at belair shore stats compared to ours and we can track those off and kind of get a big picture overview of what's going on between hillary beach and miller shoulder and then connect the dots and some of the things that smalls bring it up so my recommendation is in the future that we get to see the bellar shore stance at the same time is that possible i would have to look and see when the reporting is sent to us should we come out and present at the city meetings but i don't see that it's not possible i'll pass that along to to kevin weiner to see if there's something there and it just makes sense that our it's our guide kind of working both areas so why not wire the two together so we get the big picture of this thing councilman i agree with you i've actually made that request several months ago and i know we made it to the sheriff and i've never seen it i said let's let's see what's happening over there from an enforcement point of view um you know we see what's happening sometimes with you know enforcement here but we don't know what's happening over there and i think some of the residents are you know of the impression that you know either there's too much enforcement not enough enforcement you know we'd like to see what's going on i mean it seems to be at least these reports the general reports seem like they're a public record presenting them i know you're presenting them in bel air shore so um you know we could go and get the minutes but the minutes typically come out a month or so later so if you could forward them to us to what the councilman you know said that's a great thing i know that i made that request before default so so we'll double that request how's that sometimes excellent thank you i think that'll help the citizens too here and see what's going on uh all the council members dave uh thank you for your service um i think what may help us you also is if we just go ahead and do a records request just on those with bel air shore for say the last year and we've got some immediate stats and we can look at maybe either renegotiating based upon the number of calls or something like that or you know splitting up things uh whatever works best to uh above flooring's advantage anyone's on council did anyone in from the city have any questions for the sheriff sure thank you very much again and if you can get back to mr reed to let us know what the uh what the results will be on that if not we can do it via records requests i'm sure thank you all right we're going to move to the consent agenda as amended so it's going to be items 4 through 8 and then item 11. i'm going to read them once and then we're going to approve them um open up for approval so i'm going to ask for a motion to bring the consent agenda as a group so it's item for the approval of the april 5th 2021 city council meeting minutes item five approval of the april 14 2021 city attorney riley presentation minutes item six approval april 26 2021 special city council minutes item seven approval of april 206 2021 city council work session minutes item eight proclamation 52nd annual professional municipal clerks week and item 11 city council acceptance of the pinellas county 2020 local mitigation strategy lms annual progress report in the pinellas county multi-jurisdictional community rating system crs annual report for program for public information flood pain management plan flood insurance improvement plan and flood response plan and that includes the county wide hazard mitigation plan it provides public information and communication regarding flooding savings and flood insurance purchased through the nfip do i have a motion to us to approve all of that package so the gas nozzle seconds there's no discussion on this we just pass it as a whole so we're approving items four through eight as i just read them and item 11 as i just read it all in favor aye anyone opposed passage unanimously i'm sorry uh nope you're good okay 7-0 passes unanimously and that completes the consent agenda we now move to the regular agenda we had two items that were moved the first item was previously item nine and that's what we're going to do first it's now item 12 a and that is consideration of accepting the planning and zoning board code final a review final report description is to accept the board's final report for future consideration and action first do i have a motion breather swap makes the motion second second second yeah this discussion i'm going to go ahead and defer again yes i the only reason i pulled this was because we at the workshop we went through the uh the line items and the recommendations and pretty much hit on all of those and came up with action items the only thing that we didn't really come up with a plan of action for was the recommendation about citizen input to prioritize and code enforcement and uh what i'd like to do is just make a recommendation i can work with the city manager and his code enforcement and this recommendation would kind of align with the city manager's intention later on in the budget process to bring up the reorganization of code enforcement and how that's going to work but rather than try to spool up another committee on this sort of thing i think we have the data to probably to make some smart decisions with that i mean i plan on sitting down with the city manager and laura in code enforcement and go through their records and their uh their lists we give them a month at the council meetings and just try to characterize what the major players are and come back with some prioritizations for code enforcement which kind of uh segues into some of the other discussion we had about code enforcement there were some concerns about focusing on the wrong things and that sort of thing well what i want to mention is that code enforcement is an important thing for us because while we haven't gotten into real specifics of what a premier residential community looks like we basically describe what a premiere or what our our thoughts about our community should look like in our codes our codes are the foundation the basis for what our community thinks the place should look like so i just want to say a way that codes are important the ordinances support our strategic plan and aesthetics and that and while we may not specifically say this is exactly what our community should look like in our strategic plan our codes basically describe what that is and it's a foundation for how good neighbors work and while we don't necessarily enforce codes all the time it is a basis for when somebody thinks somebody's not living up to their obligations as a good neighbor it gives us a fallback position to enforce that so that's all i want to say thank you the way i understand this in number nine here is we're accepting ford's report but we're not implementing that report we just had about a two-hour session as councilmember gunn just said um so this is we've done this before we accept it for for final review in fact if anyone read the minutes of the work session pretty much had most of the concerns that we kind of had consensus on so each one of those actually represents an ordinance change that has to be changed separately so there's going to be more debate on this and i think that's also where you're concerned you know with the code actually comes in and we certainly can prioritize it so we had a very healthy discussion i think with that and um you know i think we'll probably have more so um i'm fine with it you know with that understanding so anyone else on council i'd like to uh back up what mr gunn said basically there was a certain look and feel to bel air beach that threw us off in here and i know sometimes coke makes us angry and we want to try to change things and and tear down for our own our own purposes but at the end of the day the more of it that we remove the less it becomes bel air beach and it becomes some other town that we moved away from so i'm hoping that everyone is understanding as we go through this code that we're not picking on anyone we're just trying to make sure that we're that premier city that everyone loved whenever they first came here anyone on council citizens any comments a and it's consideration of accepting the planning and zoning board code final final report review final report this will yes vote will accept the code's final report for future consideration and action all in favor aye anyone opposed that's a seven to zero we now take what was item 10 and it's now 12 feet and that's consideration of approval of the local option fuel tax interlocal agreement excuse me yes number eight no it was part of the part of the consent agenda it's not because it's consent agenda but it will be discussed i have a feeling when we get to patty's part of the show i'll say something um in fact we actually have a little honorarium coming for the city clerks at our mayor's council so yeah we're getting that later that's just so everybody knows that's the honoring the municipal clerks week and uh so that's what we're going to be doing here um we may just made a proclamation which is in the packet and later on we get to patty's section of some stuff i think probably safe here okay so um we're on 10 now this is consideration approval of the local option fuel tax inter-local agreement uh first a motion so second second by robin hockey i uh actually ripped through this and even though it's a five cent the potential for a five cent tax uh i saw opportunity for our town um not so much with response but as a way that maybe we should go to fort pinellas and sort of lobby to raise our concerns about what's going on with our traffic how it's not only affecting us but it's also affecting bel air shore and also failure bluff more than anyone else it's it's these three communities uh we're in a sort of unique position compared to all the other towns in pinellas county uh most of these most of these cities have direct access to have uh i would call them premium vacation spots and that would be clearwater beach and saint pete beach no one is required to go through another town to get to these cities they can fight off the interstate or right off highway 60. we are a little bit different because as soon as traffic backs up google says go go that way go through bellaire beach it's faster and what i've noticed is whenever local boulevard stops google says go down 19 and a bay shore make a left and then you'll you'll be ahead of five cars that you were behind uh five minutes ago i hate that this is happening and really i believe that the only real fish would be a bridge going over to sand key basically from clearwater over at sand key even if someone said let's do this let's get started tomorrow we're talking 10 to 20 years before anything like that would ever happen so so basically what i recommend is that even though it's too late now we should get the three communities together and in a joint effort approach for pinellas and say we think we should get a little bit more than what you're giving us and instead of taking it from everyone you should take it from clearwater because at the end of the day there are clear winners in this in this whole situation tonight i'm going to i'm going to vote yes on this because basically if it doesn't go through which it's a little too late now to get started on this then there's no chance for an increase at all we get .09 is that right yes you know at this point i'll take it i think it's worth it even though gas costs more now i just see all the people coming in and i see the potential for more revenue for the city so i think in the next year i'm going to work with everyone here and in the other two neighboring cities and see if we can do something about this and maybe maybe have the rights uh readjusted thank you the reason why i had asked to move this into this regular agenda instead of consent agenda is the rate itself i think it's pathetic 0.09 that means we're getting less than a penny out of every dollar that's collected on this tax we're paying five cents a gallon um but we're getting basically nothing back to give you an idea kind of dovetails a little bit with what vice mayor said clearwater gets six point six nine percent saint petersburg gets 15.3 percent and ellis port gets three percent and of course this is the counties tax so they get 60 i mean we're doing the heavy lifting we're taking the heavy traffic or get nothing so i'm not going to vote for this tonight and the only reason also that i'm not going to vote for it is i don't even see how the methodology was calculated there's nothing in this paperwork here that shows how they came up with these numbers there's no computation there's nothing that i can check back to see that they did their due diligence and they're asking us to sign off on what you know promises to be an interlocal agreement without giving us any real support for how they came up with their numbers and any proof so not quite sure lynn it looks like you want to say so mayor the how the percentages are calculated is by population and i verified that again today and it's the 60 goes to the county the 40 percent is divided among the rest of the cities and that's divided based on the population we have inject that to make sure that their calculations are correct right and we don't know if it's the population pre-census for post-census right now i don't know the exact number i can't tell you that but that this is an aero local agreement you know it's typically run in 10-year cycles and we get the local options gas tax every month and uh it's all the cities are sharing that some are sharing a little more than others that's well based on the population from what the county's done well you know i've been on traffic for a while here and it's not getting any better there's no solutions you and i've met multiple times with the county people they've given us a couple things but it's not making that big of a difference really not from what i can see and um you know a bridge sure i mean it'll take 15 years but you might want to start it now because i can't even imagine you know one of the things last year before covet hit in the mayor's council they were talking about the visit clearwater saint pete the group was so happy that they were they had gotten the word out to everyone in the country and they were showing us billboards in boston and new york city and stuff and they said well now that we've done that of course this is right before kobe they said now we're going to focus on getting the people within the state to start coming here so that's where they're going with this they want more day trippers coming over from you know the mainland and from the inner portions of florida so um i think whatever we have now may not be looking back at these being the good old days if they get their wish so just something to think about so i i personally would like to see some more information that's my feeling and couple of council members right yeah um the big problem i have with this these penny pitch and fuel taxes i've experienced for over 40 years they seem to want to go to the right place but they never end up going the other thing is we have a federal government right now that's really pushing electric cars electric vehicles they're not going to pay us and i guess numerous state senators legislators that came from the construction world most of the money for highway usage comes from the gas taxes all right these electric cars partial electric cars we're not getting any weapons they still tear up the roads they still care about the bridges what are we going to do to replace that lost revenue body gets his way why new trucks want to be a relative i mean uh right this could be a this could be a tax of nothing all right how much is it really going to save us and how much is it i agree with the announcement we need a bridge you know jk but i won't let you see it not i'm not ill um i it just won't happen in my lifetime so i'm dead i'm dead against this you come from the state of new jersey right yeah those yes gasoline badge and i was just drowning the roads of new jersey and i i mentioned to june i said um roads are as bad as they've ever been but their taxes are higher than they've ever been so you're right you're right uh yes my question is to the city manager so if we don't pass this we get nothing right is that how it works at this point because there's no negotiating i don't feel like at this point in the process it's too late so if we don't vote for this we just absolutely get nothing well we currently have an analytical agreement on the existing all this is doing is giving the county sen to the county is telling us we will share in the 5 cent if they implement it if they don't implement it which is if they've got until october implement but what the county administrator asked us is to get the other local agreement approved so if it is implemented then at least going forward we're going to get part of it but at the current time i don't know if i'm not doing this because we are still under the other this is just a and i haven't i i'm sorry can i add something real quick i think that it doesn't require 100 approval i think that it's a majority i don't know what that number is but i believe that's what i read he said some people may not sign it and either way they'll still get it if it's improved that was actually going to be my next question so thank you vice versa my gun personal political opinions aside i think that the day of reckoning for electric vehicles are coming i mean that that subject is getting a lot of visibility now exactly what you're saying but political personal political opinions aside i ask what's best for the city of miller beach and if that provides one dollar more than what we have in our budget now and i am all for supporting this thing we can go back and try to negotiate a higher rate but why why would we turn down money coming to the city of miller beach that makes no sense whatsoever if it's a dollar more than what we had yesterday i am all forward and we need to get smart about this fees are the way to go and as it as it showed in the presentation from pinellas county one third of that money comes from non-residents so i mean these are all these are all the people coming down on spring break or on vacation or the snow birds or whatever they're not they're not necessarily a homestead residents but they're bringing money in and we should take advantage of it but to just cut off our nose despite our face makes no no monetary sense whatsoever thank you someone correct me if i'm wrong but the way i read it is we're going to get that tax whether we approve it or not i think i think this whole if the county approaches yes i think this whole thing should go back to county committee and have a great tool i think it's unfair that we take the burden of the traffic um electric vehicles i'm not getting political but it's it's a fact of life um they're here and they're here to stay i just don't think uh we should jump on this and say bravo to the county comparison the i'll go and then you go yeah so you don't negotiate contracts after you sign you negotiate before you sign it and this is before we signed it we don't have to sign this today the county hasn't passed this it's not even on their agenda right now they have until october it's incumbent on us there's been at least two possibly three readers hope raised the question as to what happens if we don't do it we can get a good answer to that so go back to the county and find out they have a county commissioner's meeting every single month and be it a representative from our council or our city manager goes there our legal representative writes a letter to them and we square this away this is negotiable right now maybe we can ask the worst they could say is no i'm not this is to sign this it's what's known as a contract of adhesion sign or else we're not in that position right now sure i'll take the money but you said something council member gunn that one-third is paid by the outside people it means two-thirds paid by the inside people that's me that's the people that i'm looking at out here and if you're going to pay two-thirds of this tax i want you to get more than that it's not a tax one second note interrupted it is a tax it's a tax fuel tax so it's um if you're going to get more than one penny on every dollar that the county collects i just think that's a pathetic return for us and it's always the same cities that are benefiting on this yet you're right we get the wear and tear and it destroys our quality of life some of these other cities aren't experiencing that same problem yes one of the reasons why there's a dates matter yes they have to have it completely they have to complete it by october however i think that there's a flow of processes that must occur and they're looking for a june 1st headline on everyone is that right then yes county asked all the city managers to take this to our council and get it back to us by may 25th and that's that's what we're talking about and that was from the county administration and they said basically the state of florida would not allow it if it goes beyond a certain date also i'd like to address the electric vehicle its capitalism basically what's going to happen is eventually these convenience stores are not going to be able to sell fuel what's going to happen they're going to install electric fuel pumps so if you think they're just going to give it away it's not going to happen it's going to be another form of fuel and we will be taxed on that also so yeah during the transition you're going to have just like we have right now you're going to have gas you're going to have electric and little by little be more and more electric but all of these convenience stores are going to have to step up and whenever that happens if any of us think that pinellas county and the state of florida are not going to cash in on that opportunity um yeah that's something maybe you should reconsider i i agree with you but i've dealt with the oil for years and i come from an area where natural gas floors and you didn't see no natural gas pumps in the southern part of the state this event like that and now we just really are restricting the natural gas pipelines okay a lot of these electric cars can go in there and charge for free right now there's one and then here on this beach where there's a couple of neighborhoods beaches and airports and i agree one one day someone's going to say we haven't put a tax on that taxes in today i really believe the county is trying to get all the communities to prove this to say oh everybody wants to do this so let's let's move it this needs to be retooled any other council members let's open this up to the citizens citizens any comments sending no comments and bring it back to council for final word okay then i'm going to i'm going to do this i'm not going to do this by voice vote i want the votes recorded on this one so item 10 which has now been revised item 12b is a consideration of approval of the local option fuel tax interlocal agreement and the description is approval of the agreement between pinellas county and pinellas county municipalities for the administration and expenditure of the pro-ccs vote will approve that and bring it to county uh madam clerk we please call the roll council member [Music] yes council member [Music] no no so passes four to three mrs go forward with the county and please let them know that also in tonight yes okay back to our regular agenda item c that's 12 12 now it's item 12 c this is uh was an item that was referred from last month and i see some of the individuals are back consideration of appointments to the citizen advisory committee the city council is going to vote by ballot to appoint up to five members to that council we have five uh one two three we have six people up for consideration ron seganick mark goldman john hanzig john j hayes robert reisberg and jody shirley first i just need a motion to for consideration of this group of individuals who have that so okay second hockey i was just like to thank everyone for uh for signing out nominating themselves with that said obviously our thanks for for coming out to do this and coming out at you for the second time is that what we typically will do is allow anyone who wishes to speak in their uh own support or in support of another person uh to come up and of course you can say something against the person too just let's keep it polite here if we could keep it factual based so with that said i see some individuals in the audience would anyone like to address counsel uh i mar i don't think you're on this one i have you on the next one wait hang on hang on one sec one second mark beam is on number 13. i don't see my number 12 no i'm not out of there um mayor residents that chose to attend this evening uh i'm mark goldman i'm a resident for almost 21 years now and spent about two years on the underground committee trying to get that project completed and happy to announce that it was completed and quite satisfactorily if anybody doubts what the finished product looks like take a ride down any of the streets on the w out in the states and you'll see what can happen in your part of the city as well we did during that time frame set up a framework for any other streets or groups of streets in the city to take advantage of the same processes that we use so i urge you to get with your folks and if you like what you see then we'll help you get there as well the my interest in wanting to be on the committee is because i think that we need more citizens input into what's going on in the city and this is a great forum for us to get into the ground roots see the things that are coming about in the future so i'm offering to do my time there one more thing i just wanted to say is that the success of the bellar island estates undergraduate project is very very much um because of the amazing effort from minorities uh his negotiation skill his work with the contractors and the project managers uh was just outstanding and he told us what he could do and he delivered and he got it done for under budget and i know that those people who are getting refunds are very happy about that so thank you for the city for allowing me the work that lynn did and look forward to being on the canadian future thank you for being i think what you should do as a council is actually have all six my head thank you anyone else i see no other hands any uh yes i'm sorry wait i'm on my outside right now anyone else okay now i'm going to bring back the council yes sir based on that statement i would like to propose an amendment to this where we choose five primary members and one alternate and the reason behind that is to have five an odd number who can conduct business and yet these are very busy people they have other careers and they are volunteering their time to assist us they bring a lot of skill sets to us and a lot of action in business activity and we need to take advantage of all them so somebody's out of pocket traveling or called away by other duties or business or whatever we have the alternator can also slip in and help connect with you so that's my amendment i propose and then five primaries um i don't know that i can accept your amendment right now i'll tell you why this was the formation of the committee was passed as i recall last time and that was passed by a um ordinance or resolution i don't remember whether we have but we passed it either way whether it's ordinance or resolution okay i think it was and i think we have to change it via that that would be an improper change so we can do that and there's nothing that says we can't use a lot you know the person doesn't you need four votes to get on this committee um but we there's nothing saying that we cannot amend that we have to amend it the proper way for an ordinance i don't think we can just add it so it's a great suggestion and i don't think i want to lose the people either but you know let's do it the right way here with the organization great yep correct please give me a thumbs up fred riley yes okay all right other council comments no i don't think so i think we can move everybody wants to move i'll just take consensus everybody wants to move forward with getting individuals on and if you need in order for this to happen our rules so you have to have four votes so it is you're gonna vote for up to five members you can vote for zero one two all the way to the five um if anybody gets four votes is on anyone else is come back and we can amend this but we're going to need two meetings before we can amend that ordinance so it might be a little bit of you know might be two months before we do it but i don't think that's a bad idea actually we kind of missed that one we probably should have had alternates in there but we've got the committee so we'll amend it patty do you have ballots to pass out or do you want the wants of the ones that we have in here in our books it's one at our seat upside down there it is okay council we're going to take to vote at this point um when you're ready we'll head into paddy vote for up to five okay thank you lynn reeves will you co-tally this with me i'm going to try and do it if you'll do it too make sure our numbers match up patty if you could just go through relatively slowly because lynn and i are both recording this and if you take it in the order that the names are on the sheet here that would be great but it doesn't really matter but it goes slow enough we'll get them all council member obvi voted for mr saddam [Music] mr kansa mr risper and ms shirley councilman the banker voted for mr sagan mr goldman mr handsome mr risberg [Music] mr goldman mr hanzo mr risper and miss shirl

sagan mr goldman mr hayes mr risper and ms shirley okay that concludes the voting right yes okay all right so i have five six votes for ron seganick you're on the committee congratulations we have one two three five votes for mr goldman correct mr reeves yes you're on the committee congratulations i have five votes for john hansen you're on the committee congratulations i have four votes for john hayes he's on the committee no player no no i have material gun slope and hand the next two you have more votes for okay i'm all right all right six votes for mr rob ron rice of robert riceberg

full board member the yes vote accomplishes that i'm going to take voice vote all in favor aye aye anyone opposed seven to zero congratulations okay next is item 15. this is consideration of resolution 2001-04 it's a resolution of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida establishing an audit committee providing for membership of the audit committee providing for the selection of a chair providing for duties and responsibilities thereof providing for meetings and providing for an effective date this is consideration to establish a committee for review of city annual financials internal controls and compliance policies and procedures we deferred this from last time first motion so gaddis second leslie materos raising her hand hey i think it's something uh needed we've discussed this in the past and uh i have a procedural question and i'm sorry i can't reach out to you earlier mr riley i hate to blindside you so if you need an adjournment i know i just already do this but there's no other way unfortunately with the rules we haven't played by um so the audit committee is specified under state statutes under florida 218-391 and it calls for it to be an audit committee what is being proposed here is to basically take the citizens advisory committee that we just appointed and add one council member to it and make that the audit now historically we have had i would say a prohibition but we discouraged people from serving on two boards in fact if you're on board of adjustment and you're on the planning board you're actually prohibited from serving up two boards it's not clear with regard to the uh the parks and rec board and some of the other ports but it's what we've typically followed so what i'm throwing to you is i just want to make sure because the penalty if we don't do this right is an invalidation not that we're going to challenge it but perhaps a losing auditor might challenge it so the process has to be proper so what i'm asking you is based on the proposal that's here which is to utilize the citizens advisory committee plus one council member is that going to work in terms of statute 218-391 yes that's all i need to know but i'll give you a better answer than that that's a great answer i reviewed the statute and the principal requirement is you need one person from the governing body which would be one of the seven of you and that the i also reviewed the code provisions related to the citizens advisory committee there's no prohibition like in one or two of the other committees so since it's not prohibited it's permissible and it comes down to a discussion among the city council members and implementing this if this is advisable from your perspective or not is this considered an ad hoc committee under the terms of our charter i would say it is so under an ad hoc committee presiding oh well this is a committee that's based on a statute so i would say that this the statue requires a minimum of three people and one of the three has to be a elected official so that that's really the ground will should have to comply with the only reason i ask is in terms of appointment for presiding officer of the committee and for appointment and recommendation of a council member is an ad hoc committee that's done one way being presiding officer if it's a regular committee it's done the other day the statute i believe it's 218 391 2 references the elected official and the elected official would be that lead would be the chairman of the this committee i think what we have in here because i remember reading it is that hang on say whatever you just said to him no what the the requirement the elected official is the chairman it's selected by the group but there has to be an elected official on it it's it's been a change five years ago when we went for an auditor this wasn't in existence evidently and this staff did it well now the statutes require that an elected official participate in this community some cities have two or three members of if they have a finance committee and i think the simplest way is to use the citizens advisory committee and select a council member to be part of that committee our audit rfp just fyi is on the street right now it's the 19th it's due back to us so they'll have to review i just wanted to clarify something it says in here that the committee members elected the chair the member of the council that's on the committee does not automatically become the chair of the committee is that correct that's what the um this says yes i'm sure the statue requires the elected official and i may have misspoke just to be honest the chairman of the committee doesn't think it's elected official yes ma'am thank you when do we intend to appoint the council representative that's not in here raleigh is that an acceptable ad if i can get the council to uh i mean there's only seven of us here that are in the running and we're all here tonight to speak on our own behalf there's if i can get a amendment to this can we make that for tonight you can okay so so will somebody would like to amend this to have that we will appoint the council representative this evening and number 15. so we can bring it back i'll make a motion for an amendment to amend this so that we go ahead and seek a council member whether it's a volunteer or appointed we have a second on the amendment discussion on the amendment we're going to vote on the amendment that the amendment is simply to leave number 15 intact the way it is except that we will appoint the council member tonight or i'll get a volunteer tonight from the council so that we fully staff this committee we have the president but this way we can move forward with the committee so yes vote we'll move this thing forward take this via voice vote all in favor of the amendment only all right anyone opposed okay so we're going to make the appointment tonight our council we have any more discussion on the uh on the questions regarding item 15 from the council citizens back to council think about final word dead gas okay i'm going to call it so this is consideration of resolution and then we'll we'll do the appointment if this passes we'll do the appointment right afterward and we'll so um we'll actually do both appointments just to make it formal um consideration of resolution 202104 resolution to the city council in the city of bellar beach florida establishing an audit committee providing for membership of the audit committee providing for the selection of the chair providing for duties and responsibilities thereof providing for meetings and providing for an effective date a yes vote establishes this committee all in favor aye aye [Music] sure of course that's okay so that vote's invalid we're going to go to roll call bad clerk council member banker hi [Music] seven to zero and so the committee has been established um now to appoint everyone so the we've already said that the citizens advisory committee is going to make up these spots so five members will be sitting on this we now seek for anyone who wants to nominate themselves or someone else on the council that's going to be counsel only i'm going to nominate myself folks and i'm doing it simply because of my background so i have uh i'm a cpa inactive i've been in so since 1982 worked for deloitte and i've worked with auditors for many years in both my capacity's accounting manager at sony corporation america new jersey transit and also privately as a cpa and i was active until i went to law school and i became an attorney but i still have an inactive license so i'm actually a licensed cpa i just don't practice anymore and i can't practice officially but i can renew that license so i have quite a bit of experience in this and i'd love to uh give it to the city to help you out on this one anyone else i would like to nominate councilmember leslie montoro any other nominations will you call you want to call the vote is that the best way to do this we need four um i don't know can you nominate from out there nominations come from the council on an ad hoc on a regular committee i asked if it was an ad hoc kind of like a draft sorry to hear you you just did an amendment where you as the council stated or amended the resolution so that you would make one of the nomination needs to come from the council not from the citizens of i will open it up if anyone wants to speak for or against from the floor no i was i i'm in line with that i'm still opening it up to citizens maybe not for nomination right some thoughts jody shirley 207 harrison avenue i just i know that plane gun has had a lot of experience in the past on budgeting and assisting with strategic planning and i would love to see him as a member of the committee thank you anyone else from the citizens bring it back to council uh i'll nominate glenn i'm glad you accept the nomination yes sir we now have three individuals in the running for this anyone else you need four votes madam clerk we have leslie monterro glenn gunn and myself nicole please council member ontario leslie know gerald council member slope uh councilmember montero council member audrey joe manson we have three votes for glenn gunn two votes for me and two votes for leslie nutero so we do not have a winner anyone wish to withdraw and we do not have a winner you need four modes i'll withdraw one gun withdraws second boat let's let it turn on myself member banker president council member god leslie natara councilmember doterra listed ontario council members leslie matero councilmember ockey jill benson vicener [Music] so votes five to two leslie terrell will be the council representative this committee convenes immediately mr reeves or like within a month yes excuse me uh as soon as we get the order back our audit rfp back we'll compile them and get them to the committee because that'll be their first when will we make the decision on council when is that expected well they'll review the proposals they'll make a recommendation to the to the council and after that's done then they will shortlist depending on the number of people and then the short list will come to the city council to make the final decision do you have an estimated date for that it's really going to depend on how many i'm hoping in right now i think the date of god is i'm hoping for the july first week meeting to do the presentations just depending on how here we get and how fast i can get the community together to and this fee will be integrated to our new one and to our new budget correct yes yeah yeah it's well it's not for the new budget it's for the current year budget they will audit that's not good about their fee because we have a new now oh yeah yes because that may change we're gonna know those proposals with the rfps okay so as long as you're aware of it okay wonderful anybody else have any questions 16 recap of the florida league of cities 2021 institute for elected municipal officials it's called emo2 councilmember gunn requested this this is a recap of key learning points recommendations and best practices first let's just have a motion [Music] on april 23rd through the 24th i attended the second uh training evolution for the institute of elected municipal officials they're held over daytona and it's a gathering of maybe 30 40 people from the different municipalities in the florida league of cities brings in special speakers and that sort of thing it serves as a great basis for networking with other municipalities and sharing experiences as well as best practices and that sort of thing they have some very good speakers with a lot of municipal governing experience as city managers as financial directors in human behavior that sort of thing there were only four major topics that they discussed during this time one was effective council techniques group dynamics decision making models media relations was a pretty good one the second segment was on planning growth and management basically planning and zoning and comprehensive plans for the city the the third topic was advanced revenue and finances for cities and it was interesting because the guest speaker and the leader of those discussions was a fellow by the name of kimball adams who is actually the finance director for our neighboring sister city of largo here and he works on the board of directors with the florida league of cities and has a lot of experience as an adjunct professor with florida south florida's south university that sort of thing and the the last thing was building your city's team in personnel and labor issues obviously some of this stuff didn't apply necessarily to us but it was a great opportunity and just a a thing to bring up some some thinking i'll just hit on some of the topics vice mayor also attended and he may have a different perspective by all means chime in place there when you think there's something i missed one of the things we picked up on right away was uh less than half the cities in florida have turned up it was interesting because we just went through this with our charter review and it was interesting because some of the cities that don't have term limits are working hard to get them and then other cities that do have term limits are working hard to get rid of them so it's just kind of an interesting take on how things were going in obviously the the the two competing thoughts are well you know you don't want to get stagnant people in there the same ideas all the time you want to get fresh ideas of fresh blood in there while at the same time you may not have interest in the people or the community to come forward and take on the roles and responsibilities as an elected official so that was just a good good thing there the use of our workshops to build teams and work on improving the dynamics but the takeaway from that is what we see and witness here in our own groups is is nothing new all cities and municipalities go through the same thing you get heated passionate outbursts you have very heated discussions some nights you walk away saying boy i wish i hadn't said that and there were other nights when they say that was a good night and we accomplished a lot so it was interesting hearing all these things interestingly uh the big cities the little cities what you find is they all have the same issues the same problems the only thing that changes are the names of the people involved in the dollar values of the the issues of the projects it was very interesting some of the best practices i'll just hit on real quickly managing the uh the council agenda to be strategic to develop those things at the workshop have the discussions come up with a consensus set of plans that when you get to things like the regular council session it's just one item after the other you kind of know and if there's there's some extra thought or something like that you can carry on and expedite business one concept that's going on uh is as you see the change in dynamics on uh journalism and social media the interaction of news reporting that sort of thing cities are more and more becoming their own news source and they're doing that with their websites they're doing it with social media so that's that was just the best practice that was taken away from them so far as a comp plant the comp plan establishes the public interest for us and it was very uh interesting how closely that aligned with the strategic plan uh the the biggest thing there is the comp plan is more narrowly focused however the strategic plan basically sets the same what's what's the division for the city what are the goals what are the objectives how are we going to get there so the comp plan is supposed to be reviewed every seven years and i believe we're probably coming up pretty close and i think uh the existing call plan was reviewed back in 16 it only goes as far as actually 20 is that right it's it's actually the process has started already let's see a lot of talk about finance versus fees versus taxes and revenues the the takeaway there was that people are much more willing to line up for fees they understand hey it's a very narrowly focused uh i'm providing money and in exchange for this service or this deliverable from the city taxes need to be very nebulous and people don't necessarily see the benefits of it so the takeaway the best practice was to go ahead and review your fees on a a very recurring basis understand what you can get away what you can take away what you need to bolster and on no less than an annual basis you should be reviewing your fees if you paint a road when it looks like it needs it then you've waited too long and that comes down to the strategic plan the goals the objectives the capital improvement plan it's a family of plans and we need to really make sure that those things are well aligned if your revenues are not increasing then they're decreasing it's it's not focusing on revenues at the expense or the blind eye of expenditures but you really need to understand your revenues and if if you are not increasing your city's revenues then they are essentially declining yes charge impact fees we're seeing that more and more i mean we do work and then we have to turn right around and do it again at the expense and again you know understanding what's the cost of doing business we take a road we plan for it we do it and then right behind it somebody comes in to renovate a home or something and we absorb the cost of having to repaint that road so impact fees i think that's something that we will probably pitch at our newest depth advisory committee and your review will probably have some good discussions on that sort of thing along with the fees examine the options you can stop doing something you can reduce services and the best practice is to reduce them incrementally you can raise the courage fees you can implement new fees and uh or you can just do a combination a little bit of all of those things improvement is a continuing process and can everybody's [Applause] surprisingly the florida league of cities is pro i'm sorry against term limits and i think the reason why what they were telling us is that the longer someone is is in office the more influence that they can have and they have better knowledge and they just get to know people so i can't say that we made a mistake but it was interesting to hear another point of view also there were there were some comments made about when and where council members should appear um i'll go into that later in a work session but it's it's one of those things if i don't bring it up to the next work session i would like someone to remind me because uh based upon their opinion it may not necessarily be doing everything exactly the right way is that a good way to say that think he pretty much covered most of it because the focus was really for food groups yeah i'll just close with two comments one is you know the florida league of cities kind of sees that i i think we're off to a good start here with our new uh advisory committee because what that what that allows us to do is we continue to build continuity we were bringing together a group of high-powered individuals with a with a lot of diversified business skill sets and thinking we built a good brain trust it's a good starting place we lead the decision-making with the elected officials but we come and go and with term limits that's going to become possibly problematic who knows but we will always have that advisory committee to provide the continuity and the brain trust for us and be up to up to speed on all the issues and how those things wire together and help cover that sort of thing the the last part i have is i highly recommend this training the the first phase is the the ie01 and that's a great foundation for for elected officials the cities 101 gives you a great foundation for understanding budgets what fees are taxes are capital improvement plans you learn a language it's really a leg up for learning the new language of municipal administration and of course all of these just keep continue to build up one another so for my fellow council members highly recommended thank you thank you council members have any questions any citizens questions that'll conclude that we move on to 917 which is unfinished business is there any unfinished business business talking about term events citizens unanimously passed term limits back in november of 2020 and as of the last time i looked it's still not enacted on our books and on the charter so can i get a status of that please actually petty's going to give you that tonight i'm asking for it now we just received our letter from the florida department of state and acknowledging that they have filed our amended charter so if one could receive this navigated that was effective yes so it's effective as of the date of that what was the date of that letter well it's dated the 22nd but we didn't receive it until um the it's postmarked the 27th like i think it was received on thursday or friday you know on the exact date so can we all agree that it's like 30th or may 1st may 1st saturday so may today well it affected the date of the weather okay okay so it's effective so starting with the next council session then we'll be operating under those rules now the other charter amendments from the last election the council election of march those are pending right now correct those have been sent to media code so we're waiting for them to get that together and send us our proofs excellent that takes care of my unfinished business anyone else any citizens have anything that we missed okay we'll go to city attorney rally no report city manager lim reeves uh just quick updates and probably some of you got it in city news but uh 7th and 8th street that project's complete we'll be moving on to 12th and 13th there are still some outstanding things that they've got to repair but the project in total is complete and we'll be removing the dock we're out for quotes for that because it's damaged and then we'll reopen the boardwalk or the boat ramp now the program is going to be open your respective of the dock right right after you do the demolition of course right right up right yeah we've got it closed now because we don't want somebody to go out on that dock and hurt themselves uh as you all know the paving is done we're having a walk through with the contractor on thursday so we'll discuss a couple of those issues that jody brought up and there's a couple things the county's got to do with some sore rings like at the end of 22nd street they've got to add a ring to the sewer cap and they're you know some negligible spots we've got to look at um [Music] the work session for the code you kind of give us direction to start on that so we'll get started on a few of those changes and bring it back to you the checks went out last friday for all the pre-pays except uh four of them and those were homes that were sold so i've got the attorney looking into that who gets the money the previous owner or the new homeowner and we'll start the adjustments to the assessment so the rest of the owners that paid an assessment will be getting a reduction except the council members we shouldn't give them our dogs so so uh the amortization schedule's got to be approved by the bank but i think that's just a formality and uh i know everyone's heard about the american rescue plan and this 600 and i think it's 78 000 that miller beach is supposed to get we're following that we still haven't got any uh direct uh clarification of what it can be used for and what it can't be used for uh we submitted we've got all the information the florida league's been trying to keep us arrested we've got all the information uh actually today we submitted to the ford league our guns number our tax id the point person and stuff like that so uh they keep talking may 15th but we'll we'll find out and uh hopefully may 15th that'll give us more clarification because really the answers are all over the place a lot of as an example the state i think is getting like 23 billion dollars and they plugged it into their budget well what can we use it for can we use it for infrastructure can we use it for things which would help the city so we'll find out uh as more detail comes but i just want to give you an update we've done our due diligence and uh we're in line for the cash if they're going to give it to us i'll talk to the contractor right i don't have any to my knowledge there's no reservation for belarus or this use of this building so i will tell you that in the past i will tell you that any government agency that's asked to use our facility or vice versa we give it to them complimentary we've never charged another government agency for that and i think that's everything unless someone has a question will you address those you don't have to do this now but will you address the other comments that um john hancick and debbie mall had directly with them if there's anything yeah i'll talk to right and i'll see if i can get a copy of debbie's synopsis that way i can make sure i cover everything fine all right yeah i have frank david are we going to remove the dot because the dots are good in shape can that be removed from its islands and waste some place or are we going to them over the whole thing well the the pilings are in bad shape and part of the docks broke underneath so we're just going to remove it and we have some estimates and we're going to put an estimated number in the budget for next fiscal year to replace it and at the same time we'll start maybe a savings thing like we've done with other things in the city so we don't get hit so hardly is any plans on putting any kind of lines or anything on our streets i don't i don't know if it needs it but the only place is weird looking right now well it's because it's black because it's new uh the only place that there's a requirement is the bridge and we we're gonna let the asphalt appear a little bit before we do that because fdot inspects that bridge and we have a bridge report every time every other year they come out with something and we've got some work we'll have to do on that bridge but it's that's probably where it's yeah it's yeah you had a you had the curb lines and you had the center line on the bridge okay and uh also how did the island in the cul-de-sac reconstruction how did that work out they've already broken uh peace out we'll get that taken care of i think we can repatch it in we're going to keep cones around for a little longer they drove over the back was it too soft too fast i mean i mean we had cones there and they drove over the cones so usually concretes usually about 28-day cure before it really gets hard and of course this didn't get 28 days of cure before they drove through the cones they chippers are chunked out on the edge about probably about that thick but it's done and hopefully it has some effect with the neighbors that were concerned about it all right thank you i have something yes um question two questions actually on this budget i just happened to see the tennis courts did it go over budget no 100 because if the year to date actual was actually out versus the budget or am i reading this wrong two oh there is a the 20 000 that was rolled over was not put in here that's so it's actually under all right and then second to kind of going back to what uh deborah ball and kinsek at that zoo call with the sheriff i asked him to give us uh an estimate of what beller sure uses versus what we do so we can see still it's never got back to us well i got some information back and i i need to find out what numbers are right because i got something back from the sheriff and currently we get a credit of 35 and thirty five thousand and ninety three dollars and that's based on population and uh they're using the previous population which sort of benefits us but but in any case and then they did a study by calls for service and they gave me 562 calls in the city of bel air beach and 25 calls for service from bellair shore uh i need to because mrs almost told me something differently they did tell me uh that and this was verbally that a lot of the calls that are made are from our residents even though they're in bellair shore so they're i guess they're calculating this is you know i guess somebody's in the parking lot somebody calls you know and if that happened if they went by the calls for service we'd only get a credit of 22 000 and if we look at the crime factor uh and i don't know how they had accumulated these percentages but we'd only get a credit of 21 000 um i i will tell you that i would you know we'll talk to the sheriff some more because what mrs paul said i want to understand what these numbers are based on what she said and then the other question what if we say we want our full-time chair which means our current contract would go up thirty-five thousand dollars and it would only be devoted to us uh and where this part-time chair for beller shore would go to could be picked up by one of the other cities or what have you so that's that's another option if we're concerned that we're spending but you have to remember that all sheriffs go both places as an example if we get a call here sheriff for bellar bluffs could come here as a backup so you know it's it's kind of how the system works it's we're getting more uh police presence than one sheriff's deputy in a lot of cases i get that i think it goes back to well they get 45 minutes a day or whatever shift but they're actually using two hours then they need to pay for it right and and we can tell the sheriff if that's what the consul wants to do well that's what we need to figure out like what are they actually i mean if it's 50 minutes they're paying 45 but they get 50 minutes okay you know but if it's up substantial they're eating twice as much so if they're getting like buy one get one free essentially that's i'm not into that 30 90 and we yeah and you know the sheriff can come back and say what you could come back and say we'll take them away from you and you'll have your contract as it is i can't tell you if that's what he's going to say but that's a possibility and then our contract would automatically go up and that would separate us from belarus and we're also not budgeted to go up that kind of increase are we pardon it's not in our budget to even go up that kind of a increase well no we we'd have to do that at the next budget cycle which is october 1st because our current contract shows that in there but what i think we need is options if we stay how we are if we separate if they pay their fair share of what they're using we need to have like those three options and then we can make a well actually they do nothing but we need to have options and get it's all about just gathering information so we can at least appease the residents because i agree with them it's annoying if we're paying the sheriff to police us with a baby's umbrella and then i don't even think an umbrella or a hood on a chair is allowed because that's still a shade so i mean yeah like i said i'm just giving you the information that was provided by the sheriff so he calculated it in uh how we would pay and he's willing to calculate it you know any way you want it i i mean that's that's what he's basically told me so he's saying if you want to calculate it by calls then this is how you know they'll have to provide something that says how many calls are made by bellar shore and how many calls are made by dollar beach which according to this he told me uh it was there it came from their fiscal bureau and he said there were 562 calls by bellar shore and 25 urban viruses two by feller beach and 25 by a dollar store they also have to take into consideration when they're patrolling the beach and spending seven ten minutes telling a citizen to take down their baby's umbrella even though nobody called on that that's still part of their time so i mean i think those numbers are not a fair representation of what's actually happening if you take all of the aspects in and that's what i want to know is how much of that 45 minutes is being used on umbrellas or how much of it is being used for belair shores interests versus ours or how much more do they get well i'll ask you further and ask you know including the beach patrols that aren't necessarily from a call because they're supposed to be patrolling the beaches every once in a while is that understanding or do they ought to go out there when someone complains uh i think they have a directed patrol maybe once a shift or something i mean we don't have any i don't uh assign a directive patrol for our beach unless i have a incident like somebody calls and says hey we've got dogs on the beach at 7 30 o'clock in the morning so i will ask the sheriff to do a directive patrol at the beach for that for you know a week or two just to see if if there it is uh actually happening on a daily basis because because i do hear you know from various people that happens every morning at 7 30 i've seen bellar shore residents watch their walk their dog on the beach i mean right but you have to be very careful with uh dogs walking on the beach because there's only a couple questions that a deputy can ask them when it comes to if johnny says it's a service animal he can't ask him to produce anything that says it is so that's that's part of the law you know they can't it's kind of like the bicycles the electric bicycles are electric our ordinance says we have uh that's nice with their dog hanging out at the beach sorry well like i said that that's that's you know law enforcement has to ask those questions but there's only a couple they can ask and i don't know if sheriffs start to switch could i ask him to maybe he can tell you we have time come on fight sergeant good evening again there are limited questions that we can ask out there if i'm not going to try to regurgitate what a lot of look at it specifics of it but he is correct there are two questions because of aada regulations so when we go out there they don't have to produce we can't ask them to produce any type of identification that the dog is a service animal so we can ask them i believe what it is don't quote me on this is what specific function does the dog perform and they tell us what it is we have no way of knowing anything other than that so again we are we are limited on what we can ask out there when it comes to service to the dogs on the beach and that applies to all the cities do you find that you're spending a lot of time patrolling the beach for shade ordinance purposes well you're asking the wrong sergeant on that because i work around six o'clock tonight so i don't know the answer is no for you i don't know is there any way you can find out is that information that we can formulate as far as like he spent seven minutes 10 minutes 12 minutes during the day on a saturday or whenever saying take your baby's umbrella off the beach or i have no idea how they can calculate the exact time that's out there i did hear obviously discussion about the deputies doing their controls and there are direct controls that deputies do have a lot of responsive shift however what i will say is deputy on my ship he will start at a specific location i don't know where that is and he will control from the northern northern city all the way down to the south so that also could include another beach he doesn't just specifically control village of course okay are you saying that it's a service animal it doesn't have to have any markets like the best paperwork that says this dog is a service animal all i can tell you is what we are as law enforcement are limited on the questions we could ask we have not been told that they have any type of identification that identifies them as a service animal we can only answer questions so if the person that has the dog on there and i love cause i'm one of the biggest dog lovers on the volunteer at ellis county animal shelter but i never want my call from the beach and i see these dogs on the beach with a 16-foot then we can get into other regulations i guess when it comes to lesions in that sense but we're talking about dogs on the beach and they say it's a surf sample we can only ask certain questions specific questions so you can't celebrate me don't have the next step would be to produce a service well i'm sure there are law enforcement officers out there that will cite and then i guess you can go through case law and everything like that but common sense hopefully will overhaul that and then go it's on you for a long time today see your patrol um so i also think this one's time to spend on the familiar shorts apart thursday and friday i have a question um just curious because of our relationship with bel air shore and contractual the relationship we have as far as at least goes do you think that there's ever been a time where you were unable to fulfill your obligation to the city of bel air beach because of bel air shore if if we were to separate the contract and we were to pay more and still contract with pinellas county would our level of service increase at all i think that's outside my spokane and answer that question all i know is that as a law enforcement officer i come out of my room i might try to provide the best quality service that i can as a supervisor i read job outside as was discussed earlier i would reach out i will respond if necessary as a knockout or if there is a i would be the one to respond not only corporal other deputies around the area so i really don't want to solve that question because it's outside that's that's fine um lastly if if the sheriff's department was unable to fulfill their obligation because of lack of manpower would they call in someone else to help i i would think that that's a that would be a nearly a disaster for that to happen because the resources available to us are plenty we will call deputies from wherever thank you very much welcome you know you made a statement about how you're controlling your pull patrol from the north end of the south end and i've got you know you kind of painted a picture in my mind it all kind of blurs together doesn't it i mean it's you're patrolling an area but i mean you don't see the demarcation between bel air or shorebill and you're you're just in the beach area kind of old aren't you i myself don't go out there but i'm assuming my deputies do they don't draw a line in the sand to stop at 19th street and we're going to turn around and come back to southward beach so so administratively i know you guys keep logs and internships you got to fill out the paperwork and stuff is that detailed enough to break down whether or not hey i did a house check for biller shore or did a house check for baylor beach i mean are the logs detailed enough that somebody could go back and audit them and say okay well actually you spent this much time working biller shore versus failure beach are they logs detailed enough for that well there are detailed logs for specific events so in other words driving the beach and asking somebody to remove the shade structure as they're driving along the beach there should be a log of that if you're pulling a number for the ordnance violation itself however if it's nothing more than in passing please take down the structure and then they continue driving house checks director controls those will be locked i know those are official probably department uh documents do we have visibility on on your logs or at the end of the ship do we get a copy of it and stuff no thanks again the sheriff goes as far as 28th street than iran's beach makes a u-turn comes back and then there's another sheriff that patrols up in irv you know to 28th street turned around i can't see how far down they go they keep going into bellevue beach but i know at 28th street okay that would be clarification so yes we have deputies that control the city of indian rock speech and obviously definitely short so that that would be not going to clear water as a matter of her team nor would that definitely go down in the indian rock speech or vice versa no thank you for helping clarify things and getting us information back to you okay that's it um we now move to the city clerk and before we move to the city clerk i just what we read before you get a chance to read it but we did a proclamation and it's the 52nd annual professional municipal clerks week from may 2nd through may 8th and it's really to honor all the work that uh professional clerks do for all the cities and of course we're honoring patty gentry that's part of that so uh i'll be the first to say thank you for everything you do for the city and to do a wonderful job and we're glad to have you so congratulations on this and the mayor's council has invited all the clerks to join us for lunch on wednesday so hopefully you can make that because they want to the first time they've ever done it to honor all the clerks for all their work so hopefully you can join us for that but uh let me say thanks first and i'll turn it over to you and i'm sure the rest of the council will thank you thank you very much she's provided over the last two years honestly i think our hands would be tied without you you are invaluable to this city and we greatly appreciate all you do thank you very much i i just want to thank you patty i just want to say you know you're absolutely amazing and we adore you and you do so much for everybody so you know how i feel about you thank you i'm gonna go robin leslie and glenn because i know everybody wants to speak patti you know we love you you're awesome i couldn't have done this without you um i love how you always know all the answers from my questions and you always have a smile on your face it's always such a joy to see you because you're always happy and smiling so thank you for everything you do we really appreciate you leslie just echo the same comments that everybody has made patti we're so lucky to have you thank you for everything you do and this will always smile on your face am i good keep up the great work thank you very much lynn reeves and fred riley if you wish yeah patty keeps me straight most of the time we're trying to keep each other straight yeah but uh one thing i did forget to mention uh patty's does a lot of work and uh she put out your latest edition of the city news and that's a new thing she's doing so you know she's adding to her repertoire along with the website and we did forget to mention patty's going to be on vacation the last two weeks of may so if we have any meetings i guess i'm your city clerk we're not going to make a big proclamation i'll just uh basically say the same thing everyone else did as many times as i've worked with her she's exceptionally pleasant and she does one thing that i i very much appreciate every time the orientation is how do you solve the problem and that is absolutely vital from a city clerk and i'm very appreciative uh appreciative of you well thank you thanks again patty citizens anything we know how you feel but go ahead mark yeah mark you got you know what just so they could hear you gotta have to come up then when we redo this we should have a microphone that like he shouldn't have to come up you know that should be something out there just a thought go ahead mark golden 22nd street uh i've known peggy for a long time now and in my business life i've employed a lot of folks but i've never been honored to have an employee that does as much for folks with a smile on our faces not only is she intelligent about any question and answer anything you her nothing seems to be beyond her show and she has those answers your emails are returned your phone calls are taken i think we're just as a city we're a blessed amber and i hope you are here for a long time thank you thank you anyone else john hands at 22nd street i echo what everybody else has said i've only been a resident for about five or six years i've been involved in a few things with the city and so forth but it's like every time i could either come into the building or i've emailed patty she's always had the right answer always in a timely fashion and i really had a surprise a day or so ago she sends me an email out of the clear blue sky as a reminder of tonight's meeting i i have it even though i do periodically get crs i do know that the first movie of the month of us is a federal holiday we're headquartered and she also had the graciousness to include the agenda pack so i had an opportunity to bruise it heading outstanding thanks john anyone else all right thank you patty again all right go to city council comments this month we begin with read-a-slope i don't have any other comments tonight leslie deteroned congratulations to the newly selected members of the advisory committee we're looking forward to great great thanksgiving interesting that the mayor brought up the polling back there because as a best practice typically a lot of them and back us up on this victor i mean you see all the different council chambers typically the podium is backed here by the citizens does that make sense and along with that i'm looking at all these wires here and maybe it's time to join the 1990s here and go bluetooth on some of this stuff and wireless that might it's probably there because that's where the connections are for the wires and stuff just to show hands in the back house the sound quality is it an improvement so that didn't work out well one last issue is just a recommendation uh best practices possibly take it under advisement for future sessions is we call on the city attorney to sum up his comments or whatever and it's the only chance for us to get some visibility as to future actions so what what i would recommend or ask as a best practice for future sessions is just a summary of action items that you're possibly taking away from the meeting you know i've got a consensus here these are the action items i'm taking for for future work and billable hours more than anything so it just takes a it takes 30 seconds 60 seconds to say hey i've got this reaction i've got this reaction i've got this fraction and these are the deadlines of the deliverable that i expect to give you and this is the deadline for it thank you thank you frank becker yes last week though i received an email from the city manager about some citizen just a visitor about some beach problems navigation orders it's been one of my concerns it's been a concern with a few of my neighbors from first street beller shores to 16th street movies were removed and went to the season actor this is really not so i looked into it a little bit farther i went to the county commissioners back in 2002 there was a permanent issue in 33 and they have idle speed no weight on them and everything like that some somewhere somehow they were removed up to 16 the bows come in at a high rate of speed it's dangerous i don't want to get into litigation that the talent that the city is facing right now when someone is slipping about this is a hazard or litigation problem looking right at us in the face and now that this person that used the city email it would have everybody public record so the original occurring in 2002 is because you by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission i spoke to them today they're not sure if there was ever a recipient of that apartment they're looking into that and couldn't get back it clearly says it's a safety issue now i can't see 18 years later with more people coming in this area and we're going to reduce safety so i really think we should look at this because it's permit that was issued there was a joint permit bel air shores and bellar beach 33 buildings right now there's about 17 movies and only one in melbourne so i think we should look into that and uh i think we should address if somebody gets seriously hurt frank is it possible maybe do you get can you get that dependent maybe and get the copy of that out to us that what you're finding there yes i will okay [Music] i can kind of speak to that back at that time just so the council knows yes the cities at that time went together and bought the buoys bellar short paid for the installation of theirs and over time no one really tore them out they just break away and go somewhere else and pick them up later and they've opted not to put them back we actually just replaced a bunch of our buoys in the last 12 months because the permit is there so periodically we go around and add buoys you know because they break away and disappear and so and the permit speaks to them breaking away disappearing damage run over in which they need to be replaced and that's my question they haven't been replaced since and what's that four years now well some of those movies been gone longer than that well i i really i mean there's 33 they had a longitude latitude that had to be destroyed i think we can go and get a bearings and say hey we'll put one in third street ninth street just to keep the boats out because if you ever go on the beach at 6th street or 12th street you can watch in vega at 12th street you'll make a left-hand turn or come flying in 28th street from your right it's a mess and it's just and especially with the watersheds they come in at a high rate and it's not in bellar beach it's not in the iraq beach it's just between those 16 months so am i hearing you want us to check about putting buoys at those three locations well i don't know if you can have the idea just get a variance first to see if we can do lunchtime these three locations well no the the buoy companies we just give them what's on the permit and they don't put them well if the current permit is enforced there's 33 moves that have to be in place but isn't that their jurisdiction yes it is so we don't have much to say right it was a joint permit i do know because they're electing not to replace we i i guess we have to look at it but if even though we haven't taken the permit jointly if they're saying hey we don't want to do this i don't know if we have any right to tell them yes you have to probably don't all right guys okay then yeah let's get this out and let's all take a look at it including the company fred riley are you saying that yeah for the most part the permits for louise you establish a map and you pick the spots you want and then you submit that to the florida fish and wildlife and they give you approval for the department if you add buoys you have to update it but for the most part their lifetime i don't know that there's any requirement that and you know i'll have to go back and look at the permit i haven't looked at it recently but i don't know that there's any requirement that you have to put them back but we do it because we have an ordinance that says 100 yards from the shoreline it's a safety zone and we can't do that same at the intercoastal we we do them there too so and sodas elder shores has the same just about the same wordsmith language in there it's 100 yards from the shoreline and as the fish and wildlife says well without a buoy how do you right control them you talk to the sheriff's department you see yeah it does look like this you know there's stuff in here that will warn the voter get out well well it's [Music] good thank you i'm also good um so your next we don't have on the scheduled meeting do we have a work session that we're planning for this month at this point it's open it's open okay that's why i made the comment that is going to be on the occasion right so to be determined probably not going to happen most likely okay we do have a park and rec board meeting on may 12th wednesday may 12th at 3 p.m here so that's it i'll entertain a motion to adjourn what's the time three people frank bancor you read as well favor hi opposed goodnight everyone thanks for coming"
