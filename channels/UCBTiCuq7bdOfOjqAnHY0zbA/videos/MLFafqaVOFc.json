    "transcript": "hi everyone i'd like to call to order the wednesday february 16th meeting of the park and rec board oh sure um tammy lavender i'm here nora kodak doctor yet george ortel i'm here nicole sussman here and then kyle oh gosh reefer yes here okay good job okay perfect um item number one on the agenda is approval of the agenda do i have a motion to approve today's agenda i i approve the agenda any discussion any okay then it passes three to one item number two approval of the minutes of january 12 2022. can i have a motion to approve last month's agenda i make a motion we approve january 12 2022 agenda may i have a second i second that all right all in favor all of us so it passes three to zero so yeah item number three citizen comments we don't have any citizens this month so we will go on to item number four um which was the review of the health and wellness fair so i'm just going to open up the table for discussion because obviously all of us were there and just kind of what we do with all of our events or activities we kind of like say what we did good what we can improve on and hopefully we do it again next year i i thought it was it went really well there were a couple things that i would tweak nothing major more more of it was on paperwork on my end that i made things hard for myself like trying to chase people down um it was suggested that we have like um i don't know like if we had all but one person one person canceled for kogan two days in advance we only had one person show didn't show up that said they forgot to write it in their calendar they apologize profusely i don't think they did it on purpose i think it was a great turnout and everybody did a great job with their tables and i thought spatially we had those people cancel i would stick with 22 tables just because if we say had triple the amount of resident show it would have been jam-packed in there but because we only had like 80 it was you know obviously people could go to tables anywhere at any time and get full-on attention from any of the healthcare providers so we can write some notes but like just my suggestions would be we stick to 22 people we tweaked the admin a little bit oh there were some suggestions that we maybe charge an entrance fee um and then maybe i don't know either give it back if they show up or donate it to charity i don't know can i any thoughts on that [Music] you're sorry no i would say you're trying to steal so we're just on item number four which is um we're just discussing the health and wellness fair so like what we could do good bad and different but like overall we thought it was pretty good what do you think george i think it's pretty good um i don't i don't think we need to charge an entrance yeah no not an entrance fee what was suggested to me was actually from one of the vendors saying that like they're used to paying a fee to participate and i i personally didn't want to because i think they're donating their saturday they're donating their time um you know for them to be in there all day i don't think we should charge them that's why i said we could donate it to a charity we don't have to do it at all it was just suggested from that a couple of them so i thought i would pass it on i don't i just don't think we needed it this time if it gets crazy with too many people wanting to get in well it's not so much that it's a way to keep them from um it's a way to make sure they show up but we had almost everyone show up so we didn't have that problem at all and a couple of them said can we do this every month i've had other people that heard from them already text or email me saying can i participate next year they weren't even here this year but they just heard from them that it was really you know well done and that they wanted to participate like anything else that we do so i agree i don't really think we should charge either but it was just mentioned so i thought what do you mean it comes to the point where we have a bunch of people cancel at the last minute that i would say some type of you know feed hole in people that but right at this point we don't need it i agree what do you think nicole yeah no i thought it was good okay right you're like all right yeah okay kyle what do you think yeah i think it's great the way it was from anything yet okay so we'll just leave it as this so um if we could the one thing i'd like to do is like talk about maybe just if we do it once a year in january i would like and this will come up a little bit later in the notes but um just take the halloween event for example like we can't have it like we did last year because there's weddings the weekend of the 22nd and the 31st already booked so we are going to book dates for everything for next year even though we're not exactly sure what we're going to be doing but we're going to be locking down dates so for next january i know we tried to get like the one like right in the middle of the month or like the second the second saturday in january which would be the 14th so kyle could you check on the 14th or the 21st because do you i mean i kind of think the 7th is too early people are still on vacation and trying to get themselves out of the holiday mindset um and into like everyone just wants to stay on that weekend yeah exactly because they've been traveling so the 14th to the 21st would be great if we could just do you guys have a preference or is it whichever one it is it is i i don't have a coverage because i don't have anything down yet i would tend to push it toward the 21st torso okay i like said i'm indifferent nicole do you care no i'm good with you there okay so january 21st wow 2023 wow for next year okay does anybody have anything else to talk about with that i think this seemed like by the time we were two hours into it the our uh at the front desk letting people in or tell them what to do was uh seemed like we had too many volunteers up front there we had too many i thought we did at times we were just times we were just talking to each other and waiting for something to happen and then there'd be three or four of us at the front desk and i think that would be part of that was because blood drive people weren't there but they were their stuff was at the desk so they didn't really hand that stuff out well see initially she said she'd take a table in the room but that she didn't want to stand at it and she wanted to leave early oh that that actually brings up something i want to talk about um so i you know i i don't know i could just say the point that i was going to make is that like people in the room i don't know if you noticed the domino effect around 115 but once one of the you know because we only had 80 people and people were kind of trickling in towards the end like some of the the vendors got a little you know like call it antsy or bored and there wasn't enough stuff going on for them for them to feel like they needed to stay so for next year we may not charge a fee but you have to commit from ten to two or don't participate and you have to stand at your table because once the one person left and other people were like okay well i'm leaving too and that would be a reason to charge a fee like people showed up but like when we did have um somebody come in around 115 there's like they're like i heard him go where did everybody go so it's like you know the massage table and the stretch table were busy till the bitter end they never got a break there was someone constantly on their table but some of the other people you know so we might like think about switching out some of the vendors like some of the slower ones and maybe replacing them for once like i've already contacted the um what is it called the mole patrol so the ones that do the skin analysis but i think they're another truck in the in the parking lot kind of like the blood drive the blood drive did great that day they had 11 or 12 people and they were really happy so like maybe we just let them give away their stuff out there and they can answer the questions and we won't have you know them at the desk yeah all the stuff at the desk for them to direct people into the parking lot yeah well they'll probably want someone on the inside time yeah well yeah so we can figure that out you think it could be three hours instead of four yeah well and the other thing is and i don't know how we do it and i don't really understand why i can get 20 million things dropped off on my front door for certain things but we can't like put a flyer on people's doors saying there's a health and wellness fair because like in my book club donna hi donna if she's probably not listening to this but she's like um it came up like because my friend said oh how was that the wellness fair because she canceled like the last second because of whatever and i was like oh it's really good and and donna goes what health and wellness fair i go it was on the sign for a much i don't read the sign so it's like there are people that literally didn't know that you know and it was cold so i think that kind of like hindered people i couldn't believe how cold it was like your crew alone would normally be like 10 people and none of them came to that and like it was just freezing so i don't know three hours isn't um i that's fine with me if we did it from like ten to one yeah if people are clearing out like 115 i think it's fair okay well i like i said i'm thinking like if there was 300 people that walked through that from 10 to 2 no one would have left but it was because there was a lull in the the flow of people coming in so whatever time frame we make it we don't have to decide right now if you commit to being at the fair you have to stay at the fair i agree we shouldn't charge money but you can't leave so i was very thankful to the people that did stay from the beginning to the end but everybody got here on time everybody did a great job setting up their tables there were a couple of people when they saw what other people did they were like ah i should have brought more stuff to give away or i should have brought like more things to decorate my table so i think there are a couple of people that were newer to the whole idea that like if they participate next year they will do more of a but we have plenty of stuff to give away and the other thing that i thought maybe too is if we did charge like say even a 20 entrance fee what we do is we take that 20 and we have little bags made for everybody to put their stuff in or like say if we get a sponsor for the health and wellness fair then that sponsor would be printed on the bag but like my friend maria was handing out bags with you know her her just so people had stuff to put all their paper and all their samples in because there was quite a bit of stuff if you wanted to go to every table you were walking away with a bag full so that's something that we can maybe think about next year too is like if we do get a sponsor it would have to be a very small sponsor but i don't because it falls into the health and wellness category we don't really want to spend any money out of our budget um because it doesn't fall into an event and i'm pretty pretty much all of that money goes towards our our bigger like events but a sponsorship would enable us to do or make bags for people that would be nice that they wouldn't just throw them away when they got home so wonder how much tote bags like just by our beach no sponsorship tote bags would actually be well 100 would be like three to four hundred dollars right kyle yeah and it's not that great equality yeah cause we got a those tote bags that you get you know handed over like three to four dollars each yeah they sure are and that's what just our logo on it not if we put someone else's logo on the back well if we put someone else's logo in the back there that's what i'm saying maybe we could just do it out of our budget but it's expensive because we were looking at tote bags to give away for the april event like like little drawstring bags to put shells in or suntan lotion or whatever um yeah and like he said go ahead the cheapest figure if i was like three dollars and change it came out to be in and it really wasn't great quality it wasn't like that final yesterday it was like i don't know like a like a cloth like a real fine cloth that you don't see you want something that people are gonna be like this is cool and not throw it in the garbage like for here if we got a sponsor to help pay for it and they wanted their logo and they wanted everyone that walked through to have one then the less quality one where they're just shoving paperwork and samples of whatever and would be fine yeah but if like if it's something that like we're just giving away at an event for a keepsake kind of like the koozies then we would rather be a little bit nicer yeah so i mean we could always get paper bags with the logo on it that would be way cheaper than that and that would be fine for that if someone only did like a hundred dollar sponsor or something like that um we could probably print those up on the printer hero bags paper oh yeah maybe that's true there's probably something you can regular size letter or you know i mean layouts that you can print labels on white bags yeah okay but we'll do something next year because i thought we missed that this year it would have been nice if like when people walked in the door we gave them something to hold all their stuff in um which never crossed my mind so we had some stuff i thought at the welcome we didn't have bags no i mean we could put that in the bag for people oh like face mask and yeah yeah because people hardly not too many people took any of that stuff well you know what i think too a lot of people came in that back door and they went straight in and maybe it was just very few people came in the front door and maybe it was because it was so cold and where they parked and they just came through the back but i think it was more the location of the welcome table they weren't real clear and even some of the vendors said to me there was coffee in the lobby like they were like no way like i would have been up there and drink like three cups of it so i just think i don't know maybe we we make a sign or somehow direct people more i don't know what was it taken at the front desk like no like just a lot of people didn't come to the front desk like they just walked right into the people that came from yeah we tried to be in the middle right across from the so it just didn't it didn't work for either one because a lot of people in the front just went right into um so i don't know if we should i don't know how to alleviate that problem we don't want to have the coffee inside the room what no someone asked me did you like have a a sign up sheet of everyone that attended you know they signed their name 900 times that day anyway if they wanted to be on everyone's raffle list mailing list whatever but maybe we do as opposed to just getting their information if they want the city newsletter we just have a sign up sheet and hand them a bag like have somebody at each door go hey go to the welcome table and get your bag of goodies and like to your point the raffle for for us like they could enter that because a lot of people did enter all the raffles so or else we could close one of the entrance doors so they have to all come through something right at the table i'd hate to do that though because if it was a beautiful day like today we would have had a ton of walkers off the bridge that would have come in and if they would have gone the door was locked i mean i would have been like i just think it would be better if we either had someone standing there i didn't mean the outside door one of the inside doors oh you just can't get in you can get out okay no but that's a good point like um i mean we had them propped open even if it was just closed they're not kind of like i mean they're back unlocked to where you have it okay anything else no okay um agenda item number five so um thank you if you sent any input to patty for the park surveys for this year kyle put together these park survey forms so oh they're for each one you know i'm going to pass them out because they're specific so what i did and you know we i just approximating the order from south the north okay uh i see that thank you i um so what i did was i took the one that we did in november of 2020 and it was divided by person and who did what and then i just kind of mixed it up so um nicole i gave you four parks 6th street 12th street beach accesses morgan park and the marina george i gave you 19th street beach access 7th street and bayside park myself i gave south park 2nd street belle isle park 16th street park and hibiscus park and then nora you have city hall grounds crossman park 20th and 25th does anybody have any issues with those do you have a marine on there the marina goes to her i mean i can pass this around i don't i just they're random we can switch every single thing on here i just kind of took what we did like i said last time everybody obviously got a few more like last year i think i had three this year i have five last year you two this year you have three um and i will we'll email this out to everybody i actually what i'm gonna do is yeah so i thought you had another oh yeah city hall grounds oh that's all the same city over yeah just included oh okay so you know city hall grounds i think i got city hall grounds what do i need to include yeah that's fine okay no that's a good point i wasn't sure well so last year we had the last time we did this we had them just noted on the base side sheet if it was just the waterfront area yeah that's technically inside it's kind of mixed and then but city hall grounds so it's kind of together so like the whole yeah you have to focus too much on but that would include like the tennis courts that's where they're like bayside they are yeah okay the recreational amenities our base side okay does anybody have any issues with anything that okay so like here's south park 2nd street 6th street is nicole 7th street is george space side nora you're off and right now crossman park is nora 12th street 16th street 19th street is george advertiser march 2nd 20th street is normal yeah we'll be after that 25th street morgan park morgan park is the beach access and morgantown well that is my room okay that's right belle isle park me hibiscus park is oh business park east and the marina is nepal okay so and then last last time we did general condition of the park slash beach access potential improvements immediate concerns potential danger slash issues and then we talked about like like last time nora did the pictures which were great um i did them on my computer which weren't helpful that day but we're trying to like like not she shouldn't have had to pay for those incur expenses for us individually are you having to go to walgreens or whatever so maybe we can have some discussions about like because it was very hard to go back like you might know but say you moved and like next year we look because kyle put this nice recap sheet together for us that will basically say corrective action list from everything that this combines so if it says you know second street park is great and didn't need anything then it won't go on the sheet but say if south park the seawall is crumbling and i take a picture of the seawall and i email it to him and it says south park seawall south um southeast corner or something up on the picture too we could type it up on the picture yeah so something so like when we go back a year later all of us will be like oh yeah that's what that is because like some of the stuff they you know it is you know what it is but other stuff they look very similar if you're just looking at a bench or whatever um and then it's got item description responsibility which i'm assuming that means whether it's the city or the county or um yeah i mean that's just kind of we use in-house too like you just have who's responsible for completing who's doing it yeah and then date identified which would be um we gave ourselves whatever yeah yeah so like say if um if we're getting these assigned today and we're going to recap march's meeting then the date identified would show up as march 16th or whatever day our meeting is and then kyle would fill in the date corrected and then he's got the percentage complete so we can like you know just have like a little bullet point and a more um i don't know identifiable way to say this is the progress that we made from the surveys for march of 2022. that makes sense so and then we'll have all just you know what we ended up fixing because some of it will be done quickly but it's like a seawall obviously it's going to be time time to be engineered there's some things at the beach access points where we don't have any control over it the it's got to be approved by pillar shores oh yeah like if it's like changing signage or something like that yeah that or if it's just a maintenance material at one time there's a sandwich comes right across them out there and i suggest we have a crossover there and some of these that might have been lynn said i can't do that they wouldn't allow it oh yeah that's not true you know bringing shovel the sand out of there gets blown up yeah so they're they're they're a little tricky there's one of them yeah two little thickets right yeah we can't be like planting trees there without right okay so um if everybody's good with this what i'll do is i'm going to um make the changes on just this one sheeter and then i'll send it to patty and then she'll send it out to each of you just like with the little recap i mean you know what you got because you've got the individual pages but just with a reminder of what the questions are so um i'll probably give that to her tomorrow if everybody's good with this and then it'll be we'll review them next next month next meeting is that good will that give everybody enough time and hopefully it stays a little warmer and sunny and nice and we're not surveying in our stocking caps and puffy coats i didn't realize it's been two years since we've done this that was two years ago november of 2020 yeah and i pulled up the sheet it has been us for three years well it started in september i started in september of 2020 and then and that's why like and rick were on here because it was right in the very beginning and then i know so is everybody good with this anything you would like to change or add is a month enough time for everybody to get to your your pictures i i put it off and did all mine in like one day or two days i mean it doesn't take that much time it's just the pictures and that didn't even take that much you can spend a day at each part all right are we good okay perfect um okay agenda item number six so for the spring event the fly me to the moon it was decided to not pitch it but like present it to here present it to city council at the march meeting instead of february she might have one too it's just nowhere that doesn't happen oh it is yeah okay i didn't know why i had so many copies okay so anyway um we are locked and loaded for the um april 30th with the band if it gets approved um nicole any updates on the pizza truck or the italian ice the italianized people cannot do it this year they're opening a storefront and then the pizza like i called one person yesterday and they said they already spoke to someone so i'm assuming it was you who did you call engine 53 yeah yeah the corvo the corvo people like never got back to me so if you guys know anybody the engine people looks really cool they are well we can't guarantee enough people will be here i mean they want hundreds of people because they say only a third of the people buy and it's not worth them to come here i do have another one that i found so i guess we gotta brainstorm some options yeah maybe just buy pizza and i don't know or maybe we can do cannoli i mean it doesn't have to be italian ice but i would like to stick with the italian theme yeah the other one that i left a message for was um i would have to find the name but it was in like sarasota was like oh no sorry no it wasn't that 20 grams pizza food truck see and i found two more so like i don't know um i can try the sarasota people but yeah i thought that the people would be a hit but they never like got back to me so then i started calling other people because i'm like i don't know what to do like they don't answer or like that's what's going to happen they're going to want to want a minimum well we'll probably have to like either pay out like a lump sum whatever it is or not which we're not doing a number well they said that only like she was saying so we said there's like roughly 200 people out of tender events so she's like that means only 60 people are going to purchase food and she's like that's not enough to run the truck because they have to continuously keep the oven hot for the whole entire time yeah did you get a number what was their minimum number probably a lot because and then two we're also doing a saturday because there was another guy like at a brewery in seminole and he's like i don't do friday or saturday events because i already have like a home base at the brewery our other option would be my original call was to slice because their pizza truck sits there and doesn't move but because of covid they said they don't even have enough employees to run the store front let alone to take out the pizza truck so she's like give me you know some time but she's like we didn't even do the dunedin wine walk and we've done that like 10 years in a row she goes we had no one to run the truck no employees so i'm like can we borrow your truck okay so let's kind of brainstorm like say we can't get we obviously can't get the italian ice people again we can find someone to make cannoli and we i mean we could find like an italian dessert that's not frozen but like as far as the pizza do we have any other options like as i mean last year i mean we could just serve the pizza at a certain time and not spread where we buy the pizza yeah i don't know why i don't know that's what i'm saying let's throw some stuff i i don't i wouldn't mind buying the pizza if we had some sponsorship which we'll talk about in a minute but um we literally don't have the money in our budget to feed people like the band is enough of this budget to pretty much if we do a band and the giveaways meaning the bags or whatever um because we don't know how many people are gonna want to eat pizza either like to say oh well let's buy pizzas we just don't know and we have no way to keep them hot um that's why i'm suggesting that one time the pizza will be available at two o'clock or something like that yeah the good thing about pizza is it's good cold like you know for a while it's good for a while like it doesn't have to be like piping hot like if you're being serving someone dinner um so i'll call slice again i mean i don't know if their employee situation is any better and it's obviously not that far away but um and then there were two other people that i found that i could call but i wasn't sure where you were and who you were calling so i'm going to text i'm not going to text you i'm going to have patty email you and say this is who i'm calling because we look like when she was like i already talked yeah yeah multiple people yeah like i filled out her questionnaire like i talked to her a couple of times i talked to her husband um so because they were my initial you know the initial people that was really hoping because they come to this area that it's all they do they don't have a storefront and i saw that they were at the um the sheriff's department on largo and i didn't know how big that was but i guess there's a ton of people there that like work there and eat there so it's enough to like warrant them saying so i wish splice would do it because they're so close you know yeah i don't know i don't know if they have people bless you so maybe um i'd hate to have to scrap maybe we can do a thing where we have a sign up sheet for pizza delivery and people just give us their orders and they deliver the pizza to the back to the park i did that for the beach painting class i had pizzas delivered out there for for us so it's like we can just order like if people want a pizza they can order it and then they just deliver it back there what do you think of that right so we're just doing a pizza order for them well i mean like basically we're like a new marines i don't know but i mean it's a way to like get pizza back there and like we can say hey we're working with such and such it'd be nice to be out of sponsorship well and we may but like we don't know i mean i know i didn't say we were i mean i didn't think we would pay for it i just thought it would be a way for people to no i know you're saying yeah i know but i'm just trying to yeah did you guys have any like food trucks or anything in the past at events didn't crab even know kirby beer does that all they'd be honest bills came and served bill a beer on property and that was a lot yeah because it was under their insurance yeah the cup they could do that again here they could do that they have the right insurance that they could go i don't drink them certain beers out of that people really enjoy that well they can bring their own i mean we don't promote it i know probably bill is fine to it is kind of fun but like you know it would be nice to get the pizza with the beer yeah okay so let's talk about this delivery idea like crowded bills does not have anything underneath their umbrella that's pizza right i don't think so who owns slice they're just individually owned there's only two right because i mean they might if they have they might have beer in their you know with their catering slash pizza train isn't it i think the slice owners are bothered these residents are they gonna be a rockstar by their beach i think they might be bothering each other i think their kids go to work do you think uh what shower across the road with something today's slice for that we can check who what's your question over there like would they be willing to just stick someone out here and sell pizza by the slice keep their profits i don't know i wonder how like if they did pizza bite slice how they keep it warm they might have like just a plug and warmer you know like a glass one that they could phone on the table i'll keep like three or four pieces wow the tough one it is because i thought i thought the trucks are going to be fine but i guess people want to guarantee and especially now with the times you're probably like you know if we don't make a couple g's we're not coming and like and then anything to the ice people just like kind of did me a favor the last time because normally they charge like people charge to like for them to even show up so yeah well what do you think about the cannoli idea so we would buy the cannolis well or we find someone to make them and sell them like there's also like a dessert truck i've seen it um or just find like an independent you know um so like christina somebody because those are obviously i mean you don't need a truck they're a lot easier you make them ahead of time and you just sell them but i just don't know how many people would be eating cannolis okay we need to do a little bit more research [Music] you would yeah i would i'd put more efforts in food see if there's anything we can get that direction i think desserts like i think everyone would be really happy with little ice cream things that we could even bring out freeze somehow you know yeah okay pass those out little individual ice creams gelatos parents die yeah that's just something else that we would have to buy if you don't get a spot i don't think we're gonna i found it even harder to get ice cream trucks and people to come out yeah enchilada would be great but i just don't think it's um yeah i don't even know who does john would be nice if like we did get someone to do the pizza then they could also do the the dessert if we could get them to do both and not to have two separate people they'll tear us through things yeah so we'll just keep calling people nicole we're going to have to coordinate on who calls you but we're not like going he's not first okay any anything else on that because otherwise like we're locked and loaded for the 30th if it doesn't get approved from city council like they know that we have to go through that process and then you know we pretty much if you look at the budget we have pretty much the same kind of budget as we did before so it was like we're going to have water and ice we're just not going to have the koozies we pay for the security um the decor 50 50 raffle like we can use some of the decor that we had last year but we have a hundred bucks to like put towards something else we can't do a 50 50 raffle isn't that what you said we can't do a 50 50 right yeah we can't i guess taking money we can't yeah wow so we're not allowed to do that like say for example if he and correct me if i'm wrong kyle if we i don't know had a charity event involved with this like say it's to you know the charity could do it yeah but we were going to do that well we weren't going to sell raffle tickets at christmas i don't like raffle tickets but that's just me i know a lot of people do you love that's a good gambler it's it's a problem well you don't drink so you got to have a fight you can do the raffle like the thing where you stick them in the you get prizes donated and you just stick them in the baskets and you put the tickets in that you can do it i love the food yeah because they're not taking money but what if you donate the other 50 to something else well i guess benefits because we wouldn't be selling the tickets we would just be giving out one per person in which they're putting raffle ticket in what do you mean you're giving out one per person like if we had prizes donated to us we give everybody attending a ticket and they can stick it in whatever prize they want to take a chance of getting oh they're not buying them yeah because then we're not taking the money we can't do it and we don't really have a charity incorporated with this event so we're probably not going to do a raffle this event i'm thinking um because i didn't realize it was illegal well yeah we talked to the church and that's fine i mean it is what it is i guess it's just because of not being a charity yeah taking the money and giving it back after that 501c and then the sign is this should be cherished my god it's working on the signage we have 100 those are just like the little yard signs that we put in different places and then yeah banner for these events i love driving into the indian rocks beach off of welsingham or whatever fourth street and seeing that enormous banner and i get that that would be the equivalent of other shores that's not us but coachman park and i get it it's staring at the digital sign but still i think that corner could be utilized we did a banner once right we did but we had to put it on the building and we don't couldn't do it right at the coach is it coachman crossman park sorry i keep calling see they literally have that huge thing made on public property i we don't really have like anything to hang a banner from there doing well we haven't made that one that they put up that big wire that goes across causeway but it's just we have to pay someone to put it up there and we can't that's a big banner too yeah it's just not in our budget unfortunately um and then the drawstring sport packs were still kind of working on that and then we're still working on the vendors so i mean i guess like last year i mean we had the italian ice truck so hopefully we get at least one vendor but if we don't have anybody i don't know it's i don't think it'll make or break the the event i mean not a lot of people didn't buy italian ices do you have any idea how many they sold yeah i don't think they sold a ton no i think my kids purchased the most they had more than one like four they were very quiet like spooning that's funny okay wow okay so yeah i don't really so we'll just keep making phone calls and i will send um the list of who i'm calling to paddy and pay can send it to you and then so you can send who you're talking to and then if any of you guys have any like if you run into anybody if you have a neighbor who's a caterer um it doesn't have to be an italian restaurant like other caterers make pizza or other caterers make desserts whether it be tiramisu or whatever but if it's an independent they still have to have liability insurance to sell food all right okay so they still have to have insurance definitely it has to be on their interns they have to provide their insurance if they're serving food people they're serving food selling they're providing food like we only had one food under their lecture and they didn't sell very much so if we don't get a food vendor like it doesn't really what food the time yeah so it's like you know they didn't really sell that much people didn't really it wasn't like the line was down the street so i don't think it will make or break the event a lot of people brought their own stuff i had enough food to feed the whole party i'm sure people yeah will bring their own especially there's so many italian people let's bring their own friends speaking of one that lives on our blog she'll make all of the desserts well you know a couple of meetings ago i don't even remember when you said it you were talking about um bellavino maybe doing the selling the little cheese platters do you mind going to ask them if they could put i don't i don't know if they have insurance to sell off-site though that would be the only thing if they're pre-packaged from a business do they still have to have insurance uh i'm not sure okay okay you have to ask well why don't you talk to them and then see um yeah yeah though yes okay so which means they have to have kind of like a catering off-site license but don't they set up at like oh no they might even be able to do it why yeah because if they do those like all those other events like in bel air and stuff i'm sure they need to have insurance okay could we do if they did the the cheese and nut kind of chikuderi chuchi boards um could they sell wine too maybe yeah if they have a lot of sense to do so could you check with them and it's um the 30th of september from 4 30 to sunday 4 30 wait april april did i say september yeah i was like you're trying to get through but she knew april oh my gosh that was good yeah oops it totally reverted back to like jazz yeah so that would and you know what if we had someone doing wine and chicutery boards that would cover you know we then we don't worry about pizza and we don't have to worry about dessert you know it would just be like a little what exactly do they need insurance a license interest insurance and they have a liquor license they do events that would be great okay they've not been marked yet they could sell little bottles of wine on property yeah they would be after you talk to them could you type up a little recap and send it to patty so she could send it to me you can't send it to me send it to patty and she'll send it to me and if they're a no-go then we'll go to bellar market and then we'll just go down we'll call west shore um okay and let's just start with those that's better it's a little better i was like oh god i have some bad news no one is no one answers the phone no one answers emails and no one has been saying good things so i'm like great i'm up the creek it's okay and like i said i have two more pizza trucks in my notes um i don't have that notebook here but i will also contact them so it's only the middle of february it'll get presented the beginning of march and then we still have almost two months because it's the very end of april so we're not shut out yet we're not shut up yet it's you forget how i forget what month it is because you know it's 80 days anyway at 3 o'clock okay well i'll skedaddle on her anything else on this okay perfect um the next item okay so you should also have the sheet that says sponsorship opportunities um do you have that george yes okay so anyway so this is what we were thinking of presenting to city council um to possibly get some sponsors for some of these events like it could be the fly me to the moon it could be the health and wellness fair it could be halloween it could be anything that we do um so the way we laid this out is if say someone wants to be a platinum sponsor and they donate 1500 they would basically be the only sponsor they would have exclusivity they would have their any of that giveaways they would have like a speaking opportunity like say when the band takes a break they would go up there and say hey you know i own west shore pizza and you know blah blah blah we're happy to be here today and thank you for letting us sponsor the event but whatever and um they would get recognition of sponsorship on our sign in front of the building they would have an opportunity to sell items from from a booth an event booth pre and post ads in bellar living magazine with their logo display areas provided what that means if um so we almost had a sponsor from a car dealership and they asked if they could put three new cars around like and they didn't care where they were just like in the grass that people could walk around and see these cars so that's kind of what that means display opportunities is going to wildly vary depend on what they sell and what they need so um your logo on the printed signs like say if we just do the little yard signs we do four of them their logo would be on that booth table provided to promote their business which i guess is kind of the same as opportunity to sell items from a booth but it doesn't when you get to the other um category so both of those need to be on there recognition on bellar beach website social media and city newsletter and at the event so like if they were our platinum sponsor they would get everything and they would be the only sponsor and then there's a gold category where they donate 750 and they only get um the bottom six and then 500's bottom four and 250 is bottom three and then an in-kind sponsor like say if they wanted to donate related materials equipment or services they would be acknowledged and their name would be on the signage so basically pizza they don't like pizza if they don't eat pizza yeah so i just wanted to get your guys's thoughts on this do these numbers come from when we did it three years ago i guess um yeah we changed them yeah it's close to it but not really i think we had two thousand i know a thousand was the highest so that was yeah and then the rest was the skin okay and it shows up better too this is copies not actual street prints it's the platinum that's i think it's fine you okay with that yeah yeah so we would present this to i mean how would we we would have to present it to potential sponsors or how would we yeah you get it approved first to take the counseling they're okay with everything on here and then what tammy did she tried to come up with a design to simplify the layout which was presented to potential sponsors so they can easily see what what comes with each so we would all the events that we've talked about climbing to the room the jazz festival all that people would have opportunity for this vehicle so like the first thing that we would do george is like go to like um and this is a suggestion from kyle like the like waste management like they work with our city we would send this to like all the big contractors that do business in bel air beach and then our second list would be people that maybe participated at the health and wellness fair like they might be interested in like coming to one of our events and selling i don't know whatever they want to sell um like you know like say the massage therapist could sell packages of you know massages or like lynn had there's a resident in bellar beach he owns like a skincare line it's like coconut lotion and self tanner and stuff like that like he might be interested in this so this will be posted on the bellar beach website and then it's literally just emailing it out to people or dropping it off to people kind of like what we did with the hey do you want to participate in our health and wellness fair it'd be like hey do you want to sponsor one of our events it would be the same thing but we're gonna start with like in a perfect world we have four events or five including the health and wellness fair and we get five platinum sponsors and then they just cover the and then we would be able to take our budget and add it to what their sponsorship dollars are and we would be able to take our events to the next level as far as like what we can give out or what we can maybe like give to people you know we would make the events nicer i wouldn't say that we would go oh well we don't need our budget anymore we would spend the money the sponsorship money together with the budgets to make the events like nicer to attend or more um enticing if that makes sense what's enticing for these potential uh sponsors their names being put out there i mean is that the only thing or what what's an advantage for them why would they say that's a great idea for us advertising advertising just a little advertisement and believe me i went out thousands and thousands of dollars just to put their name on a billboard to put their name in an event and if they can get a few moments of bellar beach's time and whatnot to speak it's basic i mean we don't have any businesses here so we're basically pulling from bel air from largo from indian rocks beach the surrounding neighborhoods it's going to be local businesses real estate agents many spas and george if you looked at i'm just trying to think of how how much exposure exposure these people would get by going through this route well it depends on the number of people that show up but like the number of people that like say if i don't know um west shore pizza is our main sponsor and we put them on our sign every single person that goes over the bridge will see them um if you look on city of largo's sponsorship page like what we're doing for a platinum for fifteen hundred dollars they'll charge fifteen thousand yeah and and the list of what they get is shorter we'll be like oh well you get three free parking spots i mean because but the reason why they're paying that much more money is because they can say five 000 people go through this event so as we're building the size of our events like obviously that's what i'm saying there's a difference between 5 000 people and the number of people we have well that's why our numbers are so low that's why our sponsorship dollars are not that high and and people like waste management they have money allocated for things like this like this is like them buying a case of beer like they have money that's just for this and they want to work with the people that work with them so you know some of them actually have to some people are required to spend a certain amount of money on their like if they're representing brands my husband has to has to advertise um certain brands you know yeah yeah like the munchies or the little like dog uh local dog companies would have been really good for the halloween thing all the kids you know to come out because we wanted to try to increase our exposure for people i mean we don't want to do it for 30 people no that's not it's not we're hoping more than 30 people are coming to the event but you never know we could get right now you know and that's like anywhere not it doesn't have to be just for an advantage right it could be any reason to sponsor just putting i'm just thinking i have a neighbor that sells candy you know and she sells it at the grocery store or you know check on places not just grocery stores what kind of candy chocolates from where her house she sells candy from her house to the grocery store not from her house she's a would i'm i'm uh i'm grilling you only because we need uh chocolate at the lightning to the moon so i'm like we need yeah you know obviously george like we're not shoving this down anybody's throats like if they want to sponsor an event they can if they don't they won't we're gonna do them regardless um we're just trying to like you know well i'm just asking the question because i want them to be able to say yeah we want to sponsor this event yeah and why is it how many people are good at well like say we can only say last year jazz we had 100 people like so we're hoping we have 200 this year yeah that's awesome so you can only base it on the events that we've had um i don't know numbers from past events for anybody else so it's like you can maybe ask patty but like we can only go by what we've done and we've pretty much had it like about 100 at every christmas halloween and jasmine i guess i'm asking because i if i were potentially one of these people and they first thing i would ask would be how many people are you reaching and if they say 100 or 200 and their if their target is 100 1000 or 2 000 they're going to say this is a this is 100 people from the zip code that's really great target you know i don't want to reach a thousand people everywhere i want to george the other thing is too is that like okay maybe only 100 people or 200 people attend the event but a lot more will drive over the bridge and see their sign like on the bridge and our signs that like we put over their logo will be on those things too so it's not just the people that attend the event that will see their stuff and if they're allowed to sell stuff they're only going to be able to sell it to 100 to 200 people but a lot more people will see their business advertised which is kind of what nora is talking about so you really can't think sorry no that's right you really can't quote a number of people who will see that they're sponsoring our event because a lot more than you know just attendees will see it we're just trying to make it work yeah it's also too like if they have a tent or whatever they set up at an event and then they have an email list and they collect say i don't know 100 emails for example and they divide that out they put a number they put a dollar amount per email they get because now they have that person's email and they can just send and they'll do giveaways and like they're kind of just like continually like rolling with this like same person like especially like a local restaurant like one guy owns like five restaurants in this area so he's just gonna like capture all these people plus now he owns the right to their email for five different restaurants say so okay yeah that i mean like that's just an example from what i've done in the past like heard about but yeah i mean it'd be nice if we got like a local people because there's a lot of like local businesses and i would love to get people who own businesses in bellar beach i mean they don't own the business in bellar beach they own the business somewhere else i mean you know just because there aren't businesses here but you know they might be able they just want to get you know their local community to know more about what they do or even like that car dealership i don't even think was it even around here i can't remember but they were still willing to like put their name out there and then what were you talking about what the one that we were supposed to do yeah that's like 19. okay so yeah still the general area yeah so it's worth a try the worst that happens is no one does it which i doubt which is where we are now yeah yeah so like it's just yeah it's an opportunity but this is the thing like if if someone's a platinum or a gold sponsor they will get and we will do every single thing on this list and like we will make them want to be sponsors again does that make sense like we're not going to collect sponsorship money and then just they get nothing like every single thing on this checklist will be taken care of um so does will this have a time limit on it or an event limit for one event you could be a pandemic for one year you'd be a platinum no no so if they if they were a platinum sponsor for fly me then they're only sponsoring that one event like say if they wanted to sponsor two events and be the only sponsor then that would be three thousand dollars if they wanted to do you know and if they wanted to to be the only person at say the um flying event but then they wanted to do a silver one for christmas then you know they wouldn't be you know we could get another event we could get another sponsor for say the same amount and what's the process they just what cut us a check well there's a form a form yeah yeah and all of that they already have like kyle hardy has all of that down okay i'm sure we'll get feedback when we present yeah so and there's a lot of people on there that know a lot of people and they'll tell us if it's right or wrong yeah i'm sure so and again this has to go in front of city council to you know pass yeah they'll get a copy of it beforehand and they can make their notes i am not married to this piece of paper like it could change 17 times i don't care you know i it's like i want it to be enticing to people i want people to think that it's worth it and it's a good spend of their advertising dollars so that's what i was like if you know i i like i probably looked at 10 different cities and their sponsorship programs and kind of picked what fit for us and what we could actually do um because you know a vip tent with wine and four parking spaces that didn't fit for us i mean like there's certain things that people give for sponsorship that you know doesn't make sense so i was trying to find things that made sense for our our events our size our parking lot or i guess our facilities so this would probably be voted on at the exact same time as the flying in march well i mean george the beller living magazine thing is that's like a few hundred just right there just for that one thing and they're in there twice because they're they do pre articles like if we get them in in a timely fashion yeah like say they say i want to sponsor jazz and we find out in june then they're going to be in the upcoming events in bella living magazine and then they're going to be in the recap because they cover all of our events yeah that right there is like they did a nice recap of the jazz they did yep and they they actually did a nice recap of halloween and of christmas but they're not putting those in the magazine until october of this year and december of this year because it didn't make sense to put a halloween thing in february is what they told me so those those events might still be yeah we're not promising dates on the after but it just they i talked to the owner and to jules and they said that they would cover our events and put these people in there with their logo so which is nice all right are we good and again the city council might make changes to this so it's fine we'll just see how it goes and hopefully we get some sponsors that'd be great are you good with that george yeah i hope we do you can walk that right on over to your neighbor yeah she's in town i think she travels a lot to various scientists or whatever so she must be fairly successful nice okay um and then okay agenda item number eight dates for future events okay so kyle you have the one for the health and wellness fair we need to back up for um so for jazz did we did we decide if we were doing september or november i can't remember did we come up with a date of time we booked did we book something we lost something in in november with wood okay beginning of november it seemed like i can't remember so you want to do there's two dates that is an annual jazz is it nine year old i remember you saying that's right after well we're gonna we'll try it in november was it the 12th yeah let me check my email whatever it was we didn't take the week of thanksgiving so it was yeah 12 songs yeah because i guess because we said it was like so hot the last one yeah in september it was something in my bugs she was the sense that the bugs took over oh yeah they like they were brutal they wanted to see the jazz people too they were bonkers they were like hummingbirds fighting our likes okay but the problem child right now is the halloween event because um saturday the 22nd is booked for a wedding saturday the 29th is booked for a wedding so i guess like maybe our options would be a sunday afternoon or kyle suggested maybe the marina but like the marina for the event what about morgan park not enough parking well it's all parking lot and yeah like to go underneath that like it's not big enough to do what we did last year well i was thinking if we did the marina that we switch it to a trunk or treat which i have no concept of like i don't know how that works i mean i can envision we get people to volunteer i know they don't sit in their trunks they sit by their trunks and hand out candy out of their car i'm thinking right i don't i mean it doesn't seem that well the kids were dressed up and they would walk around the 19th week to saturday before thanksgiving week yeah okay nice that is locked for a pound um so we're talking about halloween yeah so i don't know like if what the preference would be to do what we did similar to last year on a sunday afternoon or to do like a trunk or treat in the marina parking lot any thoughts wait so why not what we did last year was just too much on a sunday oh i thought you meant like where it was oh because it's booked that's what you're saying yeah yeah the two sales the two saturdays were booked and then i didn't know like what about you know october the whole month people have decorated for halloween i mean what about the 15th is that too early so we can't do an outside event on a day that the inside is booked no because a lot of people get married outside and they're here all day setting up and we didn't do a whole lot in the room but they were the judges were in the room people were running in and out of the building i got you like and you know they're you know depending on what time they start we just can't be tripping over the bride yeah and halloween is a saturday halloween is a monday monday the 31st oh so why not yeah why don't we do it on sunday sunday the 30th can we do that kyle what do you think george oh but this is the thing though is there anybody to clean after the wedding there's a wedding on the 29th we're not really in here so i guess if it's messy it's not that yeah it'll be like when we did the jazz aren't we at the wedding before what about time preferences for sunday the 30th i'll just do the morning what do we do at this year 10 i know but church is the only thing that looks bad and people might not be available because they're a church and only catholics have church on saturday that i'm aware of maybe other people do i don't know but that's why it was like afternoon like two to four or four on what time does it get dark in october still pretty late so are we gonna do so you're thinking about doing the trunking no no that was just in the marina because it's gravel and just to do everything that we did last year with gravel all over the world all right so 6 47. so we could do sunday the 30th from four to six and basically do very very similar to what we did last year i don't want to call it pets and pals though do we have to call it that it doesn't roll off the tongue very well can we still do like that trump can treat like instead of the parade yes like so we can just have them like the people like do the trunking tree like in this parking lot and then like instead of like doing a parade they can do like like just go around yeah that's a great idea because then those people can also like give out like dog treats yeah and then it still gives the judges time because kyle's like the parade gave the judges plenty of time to figure out the scoring so like yeah so we could do a trunk or treat in the parking lot as well i think that would be great yeah instead of like trying to get the kids to go all the way because then we like lost people and i was a nervous wreck with the cars yeah so i think if we keep it close it would be like and then two like them they can get more candy yeah yeah i mean wherever we set it up but at least like yeah it might be nice to keep everything back that's fine yeah yeah no i like that idea we would just have to get um volunteers to do it and buy candy um in kind sponsors i'm sure like families would like give out like even like the couples that came that just were there to like watch and stuff like i'm sure they would give out candy yeah i mean i don't mind i don't get a single trick-or-treater at my house i know i mean i'm sorry last year i had two and they took the whole back i had to always call my neighbor and say don't forget to send your kid over to my house and trick or treat yeah i did one kid for three years and then they moved out of town oh i think it'll be fun yeah no i think that'd be a great idea i mean like i did the candy bags this past year i mean i just would have my husband and stanley sit in the car and pass it out yeah [Music] all right so what date did we think so sunday the 30th from 4 to 6. is everybody good with that yeah i think that's what did we say for the jazz on the 19th because the sun does set earlier than that the sun goes down yeah last year was four to seven yeah we do like three to six three six yeah that would work it says sunset at 5 36 and then the christmas thing we have no problem because it's just the hour before the the council meeting right then we do two to five huh it says 5 36 sunset on the 19th so you said two to five that okay yeah that works after okay well if we have a sponsor then we'll have food yeah that's early for dinner no that's good and then so christmas what's the christmas date uh we didn't do that one right it's the first first counseling so that's pretty good so it'll be the fifth six this year december 25th at five o'clock yeah okay and obviously we can talk details later after they get approved and we're closer so really the only date that you have to lock in is the october date yeah and the other two are good already okay perfect so how many events do we have 405 spread and that includes the tree lighting yeah that's the december 5th make that better or something huh i'd like to put something else in there and beef it up a little bit yeah you know i would like to be incorporated with a charity this year like where people donate an unwrapped toy or something um i didn't really love the christmas carolers because you couldn't hear them i i it was better just having the music blared in the room do you have any thoughts on how you'd like to make that better if we get a sponsor i'd like to do like hors d'oeuvres and wine but i don't know about that i don't know it just seemed like it was not very well designed or something i don't know i i think i remember somebody saying okay now the carwash they're going to exchange and lick catalytic for a few minutes and that's enough for them yeah well we were thinking about doing a charity we're going to light the tree and lit the tree and that's it yeah well what do you think i i i don't know but i just it gets on santa santa yeah that's a thought or if we do like you know how there's places that do like the angel like the tree right like they put like the angel on the tree or like they pick a family or they donate a toy or something yeah i think maybe that would get people involved like if they wanted to do it they can like bring they can get the angel in advance or whatever bring what they want and then each person puts their angel on the tree it's a lot of coordination to get the families to get what they want and all the sizes get it to the people a month in advance get them or maybe they just donate one thing or like how you're saying the toy just bring a toys for tots and then we could team up with like either um the sheriff's department or somebody else that's already doing it and then they would yeah it would be that was somebody else yeah no i get the family thing is hard it's very kind yeah it's very complicated if there's something like we can get people involved well also do that but don't they get it from a charity and then give it out to kids well no i thought they got all the orders or whatever wish list from the from the charity and then then they gave back you know with the card or whatever they call the troop with the gift back to the charity i thought it was i can find out who did it there but i don't think that there'd be too much coordination yeah well it's just something i think we should start thinking about now if you're around the same page or trying to beef it up a little bit yeah well you know what it all depends on if like so if we don't get the carolers you know that's that was basically the budget last year i think we spent 150 bucks or something on the christmas cookies like it would be nice if we could have nicer appetizers and maybe something um the music we could just pipe in christmas music yeah i'm open to anything like i don't think it was like it had to be anything crazy like yeah i probably wouldn't do the colors again but that's because like i didn't know they were starting and then people weren't outside and they're like singing and there's someone well yeah they had no microphone and you couldn't really hear them so and it's not like you know it's a big space and there were quite a few people here and a lot of people did move outside and that was fine but and when i think they have a total of what maybe six to ten kids so i don't think the santa things picture with santa's gonna go over that well because there's just not enough kids maybe if we advertise come get your picture with santa but i don't know i think we would probably if we want to make it like something nicer and more i don't want to say entertaining but like i don't know you go to a lot of christmas parties nobody's dancing on the table you know it's just supposed to be like cocktail like well no cocktails but like talking you know meeting new people um just getting in the christmas spirit i love that everybody dressed up but it's not like we're gonna have you know giveaways or anything like that yeah i mean we can maybe theme it out that would be fun like my my nate actually she's more your neighbor than mine but like friends of mars did like a grinch christmas and themed it out with that and that was really cute but i don't know other than having like nicer and doing a charity and better music and then maybe if we like took the money that we smell i don't know what did we spend we didn't spend a lot of money on like the hot chocolate and stuff did we because it doesn't say we can just maybe try to get like bella or coffee to do like the coffee and then we can do like more desserts or like i don't know donuts i'm not sure but i don't know about the entertainment i think just music is fine but light the tree and then like people kind of made their own entertainment by like talking to each other and it was just like and that's all they wanted to do was like communicate with each other they're like oh great then that was it then the meeting started it was over so tree lighting seemed so anticlimactic i don't think that's the right word but it is it was waited for the tree to be lit and now what and well the meeting started like six minutes after we lit the treat right or maybe 15 minutes and they sang longer i mean yeah it's not dark yet really was it dark not really no it was starting to like the sun was starting to go down you know not bright sunshine but it wasn't pitch black i don't know something to think about yeah yeah what do you think about the sales we didn't sell that much that day a few things but not a lot the best was the jazz because we just like blew out of like every we still take all the towels and all of that um and then the holiday we had a few things so we sold a few things but like we started to dwindle on like the t-shirts and stuff so we just didn't have sizes um just a few but yeah i mean i just don't know if maybe we don't sell at christmas i mean it's a nice idea because you think if they want christmas presents but it just didn't really yeah he just got chocolate and it was unnecessary yeah and like the tree lighting especially it was like right before the meeting so they were like so focused on getting their seat that well i think that distracted from like you know it's not i mean you know it'll be a feel-good thing if we do a charity and you know it was fun taking pictures of everyone like everyone that i got in front of the tree you know naked just like maybe elaborate a little more on the food and make it like a social world of being and then incorporating that cherry aspect make people feel good and then whatever we decide to do we can like announce it at the jazz in the park yes and then we can get it together early so that like the more we'll get like more stuff donated or whatever charity whatever we're gonna do okay yeah no i think it'll be good yeah i don't know how we make the christmas tree lighting more exciting to make it any more special i mean it is what it is no no i totally agree with that and i was really bummed out that like the carolers weren't all that i envisioned like they were fine but like i just didn't realize that like you couldn't hear them unless you were standing this close to them yeah i didn't know they didn't have a you know microphone the only suggestion i have is if whatever we choose to do with like if they bring a toy or whatever if there was a tree in the hallway and then like say the like i don't know the kids donated something like we would just like they would just write their name on this like little ornament thing and we'll just put on the tree that's like all i can think of we had two trees in the hallway i think yeah if we had one like with like oh yeah we yeah we moved the other one it goes out there because we moved out for the wedding or something it was out there i think yeah and it would be cute too because we didn't have a ton of kids but like if we had little like christmas stockings with like candy canes and christmas candy in them to give to each of the kids i mean that would be nice if we're not going to do you know they don't there's not enough kids to do santa but i think like if we had a little something for the kids to say merry christmas like that would be nice yeah that's probably that expensive either but it's february so we have time to think about it it's gonna be tomorrow right it's gonna be september soon um okay so the next item number nine is the beach cleanup location and the keep pinellas beautiful detail so i think you guys are aware that lynn and kyle signed us up for keep pinellas beautiful and with that so we're on their website now like so people know more people will know about our beach cleanup every month and can participate if they want and then we you know we've been using their sign up sheet like their liability waiver or whatever but now like they gave us a list of things like supplies that they can offer us you're supposed to get back to me on that i'll follow up okay so the only thing i was thinking because like i never because nobody shows up at the same time and obviously like there's a group of people that'll stay and have water and donuts but then i i can never seem to get a picture like say if i have 22 people i can never get all 22 people in the picture because they disappear if key pinellas beautiful will give us like t-shirts and chick-fil-a um gift cards i would love to be like if you stay and get in the picture then i'll do a drawing like you know out of you know you have a 120 shot to win a gift card and a t-shirt but just something to like so i can get the picture of the full yeah because i never seem to get one i get half pictures and people are kind of stragglers or like they're like oh i don't want a donut so i want to leave so i would do it right when everybody got back and then it might keep them there for like the 10 minutes i need to get the picture so it was a thought if they if they do give us some stuff yeah and if not the other idea was you know we're going to have a thank you to all of our volunteer kind of luncheon thing we would get if they give us t-shirts and gift cards then we give those out do like the little raffles at that event that would be the other thing that we can do we're not exactly sure what they're giving us but we'll see um but it's nice and i actually had a group i sent it to kyle lady that owns jared one of the jared's jewelers they're bringing like six or seven people to the one in march oh it's awesome they're bringing shirts diamond shirts diamonds yes tiaras the beach cleaner so i didn't know okay so last month it was freezing it was miserable so you know like i don't know what you guys feel about like we've been meeting at 19th street i was thinking about moving it to morgan park because if we're getting more and more people that don't live in bellair beach which we're more than happy to have them and more than happy to you know like um welcome them but it's very difficult to send them down to morgan park or the marina and then have them walk back and then walk back to their car it's i know it's a mile or whatever it is but when it's freezing it's not fun and then you know it's like we meet at morgan park because it's very easy to go okay there's 20 of us 10 people are going south and 10 people are going north and then we all meet back in the middle for donuts pictures and whatever it's very it'll it won't work that way if we go down the other direction so i'm kind of just looking for some ideas because it's really tough and then so if i have 20 people all 20 people go the same direction or do we start clean and sand key that's the other thing that's all part of if you're a morgan you stay out holiday up a little past the marina yeah yeah it was still a good chunk a good chunk okay and i know we don't get that far it's all bella beach too if when you do it 19th street you were walking across the other shores i know but i mean if i go to the beach i go to the beach in bellaire shore so i don't have a problem cleaning it plus the beach gets a lot center there too so it's easier to cover yeah so you're all okay with changing the location of morgan park mm-hmm that's what i mean i like it okay and you just tell them to go to the um the last overpass or go to wire walk over to walk over so because that last walk over the boardwalk is like there's one condom more about our research so if you're riding walking north from morgan uh-huh you're gonna see one boardwalk and then you're gonna see a second floor block it's time to go to that because after that it's just another condo well they just walk now based on time isn't it yeah it's based on time yeah yeah so they may not make it that far but just tell them just as a landmark okay and honestly like i've been there enough to know on saturday morning i guess originally i was concerned that it's a public parking lot and there wouldn't be parking for everybody but that early in the morning no one's there and even yoga and she moved it till i think 9 or 9 30. so like she's not even there yet either so it's like we'll be fine with parking and plus people can just go right across the street and park at the marina if they have to because it's not a mile and a half it's just like how far is do you know from the marina of morgan okay so it's a little further than i thought it's a little bit okay so you can change it on the sign and nicole you can change it on the posting and then i'll have patty change it on the website this is starting from march right yeah okay perfect that'll make me feel better because i hate sending people down when it's yucky out even when it's nice it's not fun um anything else we need to talk about kyle for keeping health beautiful no not really you talk to it yeah they do like an online sign up for their eventbrite website which i don't know if you've ever been like certain online tickets stuff they use that website but they have on membership whatever so they put us on their event right what do we have we got two people we recognized that came that signed up through them that came so i may get it in february yeah um i don't know i think i don't know because if i'm talking to them i think we're kind of appealing because we get about donuts and water i don't think every place does oh really i don't know i just you know because everybody were asking for information they didn't you know they didn't really know that was normal you know they're like oh okay yeah cool that's awesome all right and then the last item on the agenda is the okay so for the we i know we talked about it and we kind of beat it into the ground and nora researched it and i reading notes that i never read when i first started but i read them like a month ago from like a few years ago you know starting a non-profit has been talked about for a long time it's just difficult so clint and jules called me and they were like okay tammy i'll set up a meeting with the lady who runs it in bel air it's not that hard they're gonna ask um cliff because he's an attorney if he can review it if it's no more the paperwork is no more of a recap than what i have to do for like the llc's that i do for us for you know tim and i then it's not that big of a deal to file the report every year i just want to see what it looks like and then we obviously it's a separate entity but we work with the city and we need outside of this group and i think we'll get some people to volunteer so it's just still in the preliminary stages again i'm going to meet with this lady and see what she has to say with him and just see how time-consuming and how easy difficult it would be to do it i think it's a good idea i think enough people would want to be interested in it to at least try again if you guys are good with that yeah that works once it's set up we wouldn't be officially part of it no not unless you wanted to be in a separate you know i mean like you couldn't be part of both this committee chain that you have you'd have to pick your now you could be both you could be on both really you have fun with that i thought mine said we couldn't yeah said he officially couldn't be part of that he just said there would be a separate would be completely separate from the city but it doesn't mean separate doesn't mean different yeah you can't it doesn't mean you can't be a member of that organization but still yeah or well whatever i guess we'll see what goes into it and then yeah yeah you don't have to participate in it you have to or yeah but i just because i'm meeting with them and i'm part of this group and we talked about it i was just letting you guys know that like it's being revisited if you have interest or any ideas um because it is so separate from us it can't be um i guess like it could be our group identically but we can invite other people but it doesn't have to be right yeah i mean like nora was really really really interested in it like if she wanted to be on that um the bellar beach community foundation too she could be a member of it as well yeah yeah but george if you don't you're not interested or you don't have time you don't have to be and i don't even know that so it would just be like you couldn't talk about anything the sunshine laws would apply as far as that's what i was anything this that you'd be voting on here that doesn't mean you can't participate in a community group of size i'm not discussing things that you're voting on can i ask this question so like okay say like this community foundation gets up and going and it's a separate entity i would never mention it again in this meeting right because it would have separate meetings well you don't time you mentioned is if they were doing participating in some piece of our events or or doing or giving a reason for something or if they were doing if someone was putting in park benches down somewhere then then they would cross but not always yeah so if we if we partnership with them as far as them getting taking the donations for the things you want to put in different parks then they would be able to take it and put the tax exemption on the right office the tax write-off and then they'd be able to give us the donation and we would do it as if anybody from any assistant wanted to donate something we would take it and um you know purchase whatever it was and and install it in the park okay so they would be able to do the tax write-offs you know which we can if someone donates directly to us you can we can't cannot okay right okay what church if we get to that stage where we we're close to signing the or setting up this what is it called 301 501 501 [Music] i would really like to have either the city attorney or at least men to talk to us about what we can do and can't do we should be sunshine laws yeah well that was a thought the city attorney won't do it so that's why we're talking about cliff we need to find another attorney that lives in butler beach that's willing to review the legalities of it right because the city oh yeah what about you i think the city attorney can give them an address this board um okay because they've done it in the past gotcha okay yeah i mean overview of what what you can and can't do that was fine as a board member if you're on both committees well there would be a reviewing of the paperwork for them no no no yeah they were just as far as the sunshine was we want to make sure we would be like a refresher training on what you can do how would it impact this new yeah i would interface with this new organization or whatever yeah anyway that'd be good especially if there's new members like on that either on this board or that board that are different like say they're part of that one but not this one then they would need that for example i would assume cliff would be part of that if you set it up yes yeah but it wouldn't be they don't have to coach this board because it doesn't apply to them right anybody who's not on the sport so it's only the people that are on the board that need to know about what they can and can't do yeah the people on that board can do whatever they want right yeah yeah but we can't but we can't right okay all right and then um our next meeting would be march 16th if you guys are available at two which i think is that wednesday mm-hmm election day is the 15th how long does it take to figure out who won what um they they'll don't know the next morning i don't know that day because i mean most of them are male 1 anyways but they total them see i just kept it on a wednesday that works for me works for you george are you looks like it works for me okay and then i get my job to check for doctor's appointments just i just have okay you know i'll have patty send out an email because she's got to send it out to nora anyway is that cool yeah okay and then um do i have a motion to adjourn the meeting it's me right yeah yes that's you i make emotion where you adjourn this meeting do i have a second my second all in favor meeting is adjourned"
