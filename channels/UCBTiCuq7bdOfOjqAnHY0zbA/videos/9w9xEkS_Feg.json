Stone here council member Wesley Noto here council member Lloyd Roberts presid mayor dve dallis here city manager Kyle reer here City attorney Randy MOA presid and vice May Jody Shirley was unable to attend thank you Patty we have one item on the agenda tonight uh immediately well I say immediately depending upon how long this meeting goes uh we may take a five minute break uh between this one and the work session but right after this meeting we're having a work session uh so we have one item on the agenda that is for authorization to award RFP family and multifamily residential solid waste and recycling collection Services Mr reer you have the floor thank you mayor so um our waste uh solid Ser waste collection services including recycling came to um our current agreement came to an end of its five-year term uh this year and when presented with that the council uh you know opted to go out to an RF P we put that together um issued the RFP um got them all back we got three different vendors uh to turn in proposals we received one from Waste Management Waste Pro Waste Connections um we evaluated the rfps on September 5th um the evaluation committee was made up of myself Aaron gland the community services administr and Ron Sanic the community uh the excuse me the uh citizens advisory committee chair um we all came to an agreement that uh the scoring of the three proposals was in order of Waste Pro being the first best rank proposal followed by Waste Connections and then lastly Waste Management um since then uh I brought it to the meeting in September the city council meeting uh asked for approval to negotiate with waste PRI highest ring U waste collection service provider um set up a meeting with them we put a long day in uh of going through the draft contract prepared by a City attorney uh we came up with some uh some revisions sent it back to the City attorney office um those were approved then um I sent the contract to Waste Pro where they made some additional um remarks and some changes they asked for that I missed um reviewed those made most of those most of those changes and we agreed to a draft contract which is presented to you at this meeting today so um for the amount of that for their proposal it was in the amount of $393,500 contract has been reviewed by the City attorney and I also included the evaluation committee meetings and score sheet that I put together thank you Mr reer Mr Mo would you uh would you like to add any comments to that no Mr Mayor I don't have any comments okay thank you very much U before we continue I would like to uh give the citizens the opportunity to speak on this matter would anyone like to speak how you doing uh my name is Ian Bor I'm G Affairs manager for race connections I have a handout can I bring that up to everybody I'm sorry what was that again I have a handout can I bring that up uh yes you can okay thanks I'm gonna ask you to limit your your speech to three minutes okay I've been practicing all day it's about three minutes and 15 seconds I think I think we can we can do that if not my my colleague Bill Kemble could jump off and finish up for me all right again my name is Ian boy I'm gumer Affairs manager Waste Connections of Florida 115 00 43rd Street North I'm here tonight to speak about the RFP 20231 and ask the council to consider moving the RP contract back to back to the evaluation committee for further review I'm aware there's a vote tonight to confirm a contract with wasbo and please now I have no issue with wasbo they're a good company with good people in pelis County um as I Was preparing my thoughts for tonight's meeting I look back on discussions and examples for my colleagues in the industry ver is my director of Municipal affirs Curt when I first started this job in 2009 and being in this business he advised me always be straightforward truthful about your information it might not always be well received but it's important to be honest please know that is the way I live my life but I understood what he meant when he came to our industry this being said I can honestly say when it comes to this RFP the city was fortunate to have the three best hauling companies in penales County some in bits in the in the end you want to work with one of them Waste Management has been in the industry the longest and have a large Municipal contracts in the County Waste Connections has been in the county for a long time as well and we have the most Beach contracts I'm more than happy if you'd like to call anyone in South Pasadena St P Beach Readington shorts Readington Beach Indian shorts Indian Rock Beach or B shorts anyone there will talk about our service or partnership or whatever wasb is relatively new the municipal contracts in pelis but by all counts they are doing a good job and I honestly say the city missed a golden opportunity to save money for its residents as it stands right now based on my calculations if the city goes all 15 years of the contract with extensions with wasbo the residents will pay over half a million dollars more in total over payments for this service the document that was handed out is based on a 2.5% CPI and based on that percentage of residents will pay over 610,000 more for this service the other colleagues I looked at for examples in a situation like this well actually ke EC senior vice president for wasbo Bill Jones vice president for wasbo and head former director of government Affairs for race bro in 2016 South Pasadena was going to vote on a new saw race contract for Waste Connections via a bid process Mr Bak asked the board to send the bid back to the evaluation committee to re-review recycling services to the condos the board agreed and the issue was discussed the city did its due diligence and the conduit question was answered in the end the board felt better about making the final vote just recently last month Mr Jones and Mr farmer asked the city Commission of B Florida to reevaluate the evaluation committee's results due to confusion and of the RFP and some other issues the bid was eventually canceled and it was rebid in the end Mr Jones and Mr Farmer's efforts both Waste Pro and waste connection sharpened their pencils and lowered their price prices via new bid process it was a lot of work for the two halls but in the end the city won with a better price and a fortified knowledge that they did their due diligence and would secure in their vote for Waste Connection uh for Waste Connections the thir thing I feel the same as Race Pro did in South Pasadena and label the board should send the RFP back to the evaluation committee and ask a simple question why are we spending so much more for the same service and what do we get for the extra $600,000 we should be able to negotiate a better price if you stay with the pricing submitted by W Pro and feel overpayment is warranted then you can be secure and knowing you did your due deal and and move forward with the contract thank you for your time and we wish the city and staff and on the best in whatever decision they make thank you Mr Bo thank you would any other citizens like to speak on this matter okay I see we have no others uh citizen comments are now closed uh before we continue I'm going to need a motion to move forward with this RFD would anyone like to make a motion so moov all right motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by lesen NATO Mr Roberts you have the floor I had a conversation uh today with our city manager and it went extremely well I had a few questions uh he provided me with the answers I'm comfortable that the time excuse me that the city manager and the City attorney have spent working on this and and minor changes that were made to um provide our citizens with a very good uh waste management company I realized that the cosing was a little bit more than um The Firm that came in second um I think our city manager has already when we Workshop this more than a couple of times explained the difference um not all always and I've been involved with many when you go out with a request for proposal uh that does include costing is the lowest bid the winner there's other features that are evaluated and in this case I think our city did a good job of taking those into consideration which is why I feel that's the best way to go thank you Mr Roberts would other council members like to comment or ask questions yes Mr Banker well I agree with Mr Roberts um I'm all for responsible Contracting we should have that in the language like a lot of states do but um I'm concerned and a lot of my residents are concerned that we're going to be getting rid of a great company Waste Management they've never given us a problem um just this past storm a whole dry was loaded with building materials which shouldn't even been picked up in my opinion but Waste Management pulled up with their truck and if there was 20 bags there was 75 bags of garbage and it it filled up a whole truck they had to come back that all said the gentleman that got up and spoke tonight he's raised some real concerns with me if we're going to change and if we're going to change a great company I'm worried about the same service that we're going to get from the next company and I'm being told that we're going to have identical service I believe waste connection was given us identical service too so why are we spending $34,000 more a year that's that's my concern and maybe this should go back and be reviewed other council members I have a question um Mr reefer if we did send it back what would happen to our service to our current service yes so we extended our Waste Management um contract one month they offered to Extended to the end of the calendar year but it would go up um and it was in the U agenda item it would go up more than it is this month for the following two months November and December if we were to extend it it's it's at the same rate that they proposed in their RFP so it's a little higher and um let's go back to our original discussion whenever we were we were debating over these three companies uh what in your opinion what was the major difference between uh waste connection and Waste Pro well we the evaluation committee members read through all these proposals over the weekend um because of our timetable we were on and um I I went all the way back to l behind the contract and um I brought to the meeting a scorecard um that you know where I kind of either gave each company a war if they satisfied that criteria and I don't have the RFP in front of me but um I did include my scorecard that I reviewed with the evaluation Committee in the meeting and um if they did they got a zero if they didn't um meet the criteria and kind of just made notes I went through the whole each RFP explained my reasoning to the to the committee members and um some of the reasons if you look at between uh Waste Connections and Waste Pro um that that initial tab one um it it had to do with um addressing and um pres and proposing that you know their services to the city um to meet our needs and you know I made a I made a comment we connections addressed uh to Mr ul and and there was uh on the cover letter they instead of putting uh to my name they put maybe somebody they formerly proposed to and um that jumped out of me because that's kind of like applying for a job if you're gonna you're GNA write a letter to someone you should probably get the name correct so I thought that was kind of a big deal um i s talked to Ian um and he and he told me he had some issues going on and you know it was a mistake but again um when you're looking at proposals and you're considering um switching from a very uh well-liked company with Waste Management I'm looking at it pretty closely um for how much effort is put into these proposals and um I made another note here Race Pro um the transition plan and that that was another thing when when I read through I read through Waste Connections Waste Management they both had transition plans and they they explained roughly what you know what their what their procedure would be to switch out um Services I mean race management didn't really have to change because they're the incumbent but with Race Pro it it jumped out of me because they they had they really mapped out the city and talked about things that they already started doing to to make this transition and it was night day difference to me and when I explained it to the other two committee members they saw it the same way it gave me confidence in the fact that you know they're already considered they already taking steps to make this transition and they showed that they cared to offer the same level of service or even better than Waste Management so that I scored them higher in and um Waste Connections that was number seven they got a che on that and they got that because they owned it they they had a lower price but when I when I evated these proposals not just for the price um it came out to me that Waste Pro was going to offer uh you know they want the highest price they were at the lowest price but I felt was confident in that they were going to provide us a better price than our incumbent but also give us the confidence in that they would provide good service to our residents all right Council any other questions or comments Mr Banker well so we got a nine and and the majority of this Council was going to hire a city manager that addressed half the council members wrong and his resume so I'd have to give them another I'd have to bump them up to a 10 then so now I'm at a 10 and 11 since names of address really aren't important to this Council um $34,000 a year or is this gentleman said $150 $170,000 away away for the contract this really needs to be relook at last chance for comments anyone all right well Patty uh we need to take this to a vote uh this is for authorization to award RFP 20231 for uh residential single family and multifam residential solid waste and recycling collection services to Waste Pro would you please call the rooll

welcome back everyone it is now 6:28 and this is the city council work session for the city of Belair Beach uh please rise and join me in the plge of Allegiance United States of America the stands one nation God indivisible with liy and jice for all py would you please call the roll on council member Frank Banker still pres council member Mark Chester here council member Belinda Livingstone here council member Les Noto here council member Lloyd Roberts here mayor Dave dtis here city manager Kyle reer here City attorney Randy MOA presid and vice mayor Jody Shirley was unable to attend thank you Patty we're going to move right over to the first agenda item which is to discussion of increasing uh the rates for solid waste and recycling collection Services Mr reer you have the floor thank you mayor so what I Tred to do with this spreadsheet is uh illustrate the current rates um that we Bill our residents uh per unit whether it's a single family home or a multif family condominium unit um and we do that through the panel County utility bill on a bimonthly basis so at the very top where it say current rates 2019 um you focus in on the highlighted yellow line which is what you'll see in your utility bill whether if you're at a single family home you're getting charged $48 if you're at a condominium uh that uses cans as opposed to dumpsters you're getting charged $45 and then if you're using a dumpster at e condominium it's $ 3950 so that's what our rates are currently and with that with the units um over a year's time that produces a revenue of 336,000 54,000 100$ 5400 and that is um highlighted in the green so as you can see our uh Waste Services has gone up so our current contract with Waste Pro is a 393 46440 um so we need to um increase our billing rates so that we're covering the cost of the service um what I presented in the middle line is it where it says minimum rate increase that that's $8 across the board per unit um so for single family home for the bimonthly fee it needs to go from $48 to $56 every two months um for the multif family can 45 to 53 and then for the multi family dumpster 3950 to 4750 so that that in itself will produce a annual revenue of the 396,000 $312 so that is a little cushion um so you can keep even billable rates rather than getting down to the difference of pennies um when looking this over I think um and considering I think that's the best way to go is to just cover what what is is needed to cover the cost of the contract this would be adopted by resolution in the next city council meeting um and then probably most like most likely the CPI is going to go up next year so we're probably gonna have to do a slight rate incre increase but it can be explained um to the residents that um you know along with the CPI that's the reason that they're seeing the rate increase and the plan is when we do put a rate increase out in the util Bill to have a a explanation of a flyer they explain you know to the resident what what occurred um how much our our services have gone up and the reasoning for the the higher Bill rate um I did an alternative rate increase which was twice as much um the only reason I did that and you know I did some research the last time we did a rate increase was 2019 um and prior to that it was 2018 and from 18 to 19 it just went up $3 roughly across the board um but as you can see I don't know if it's just when they when we started building residents for the service if we just always had a a higher Revenue than what we were what our expenditures were because if you if you took the the rate at the time that they raised um the the cost $3 so the utility bill $3 we already were meeting um the cost of the service so I my assumption is that over time as as the service went up they uh proportionally increased the utility rate but weren't actually I guess calculating it per what the revenue was versus the expenditure so I put that last that bottom line that would if we were to go back to 2019 um as you where you can see the 2018 Waste Management contract was you know two thou $283,600 th000 more um in revenue for those services so the reason you know I just Tred to compare that with this alternative rate increase um something similar um because as you can see since 2019 we've seen drastic increases in service costs but we we haven't had to raise the rates and that's because we had so much cushion now was that because we had uh a a pad that we were stuffing in reserves if you collect money for uh collection services that that money can't be used for anything else is that correct that was that was being put into the general fund because it was being collected and it's paid out of the general fund so it was just it was just going into reserves I see so see essentially it was just making more money so we could use it in it if it goes into the general fund we can use it for any purpose right yeah it could be moved to any any fund so what it sounds to me like you're saying is we can charge whatever we want to for garbage I I'm not in no way I don't want anyone to think that I'm proposing that but I I'm a little confused that that we're collecting 118 percent uh Revenue to contract one year and that 18.64% was not spent for what it what we collected for that that's so it bothers me right um I just discovered this why I start calculating the rates okay um obviously it's it's probably good to have a little pad uh so because they are going to increase the rate uh anytime we negotiate a contract they have a cap on how much they can increase but it does go up um I don't have a problem charging a little more but I would like for that money to be used solely for collection services and not for just a general fund because I think that that's a misrepresentation of uh what it states on their water bill right Council uh comments questions yes Mr I agree with you 100% but but I think what what Kyle's uh put together here is and he commented already that he's going to be much closer with the revenue that we're going to be collecting that goes from pelis County to us and then it just goes in our general fund yes so there's less likelihood that there's any padding there and we can just do that each year right we can we can just change that number each year um at the same token same time if for some reason we end up spending more money than what we collected the fact that it is in the general fund is probably a good thing because it gives us a little bit of flexibility there if we had to you know if we had to overspend by some small amount theoretically we're okay if it was in its own separate line item fund and we needed more money for that and that was a fund that required us to move dollars that that's kind of a lot of effort so but I agree with you 100% this minimum rate increase would still gives us um you know like $3,000 of padding that if there were some additional charges by the company we should be okay and that's that's pretty much what we get charged for um we pay to penal County to to use their utility bill system oh we pay them for the service nailing and the accounting right but it's not $50,000 right I thought they just did it for free because they led us Ah that's a good one other questions or comments for Mr reer Mr Banker you're very quiet well we're going to get an8 increase when we could have gotten what a four or five single family yeah it's easy to get big it's so it's so hard to get small and i' watched Tampa do their budget they were $40 million in debt I mean I don't think we're going to ever get that big but prices just keep going up and if we can control them we had an opportunity and we didn't do it you asked okay but you didn't answer my question not your opinion of how we just voted I wanted to know your opinion on this rate I just gave it to you we we could have saved the taxpayer around $3.50 $4 a month by going with the other plan yes Mr Chester I don't I like the idea of do I need to turn I don't need to turn this yes you do need to turn it on because uh is no they're listening on okay right I'm good with with a pad small small pad um things go up I think everybody intends knows that that happens I mean cost of everything is going up so I think that's only reasonable I'm I like the idea of being in the black but not to where we have like a slush fund um we don't need that I but being in the black is great and I like the idea of we wait until the increases come and we pass it on at that time I might be dead in a year and I don't want to pay anything more than I have to between now and then thank you Mr Chester any other comments Miss Livingstone I'm in agreement with you mayor um I believe believe that the 8 rate is good I don't like the 18% overage that we've had in the past um I would like a number more true to form so I'm in agreement with that now I do have one question about this rate um we have storms and things happen and uh uh you were able to acquire a dumpster uh for sandbags and I think that that didn't cost anything they just rolled it in is that right I haven't seen the bill for that yet they could still bill us per per we I expect them to bill us okay but they may not okay so uh something like that happens and we're at 100% on our collection uh on on how much we're collecting which is about we're you know 10 3/4% um historically we've done a 15 roughly a 15% pad is that right yes okay um I think 15% is too much but I don't know if I'm totally comfortable with just let's break even and not have any any reserves other than the general fund uh so um I would be happy with maybe 102 I know it's more but at the same time uh storm season keeps coming and you know if uh worst case if we get too much well then we can back it off but I would I would think that that 72% may not be enough to make me feel comfortable I was the rest of the council how do you feel about that on that note when Irma came up here Lynn had private contractors picking up yeah because they had Grabbers and it was just overwhelming Waste Management didn't do that it was a private contract he set up that money came out that wasn't on counselman but I would assume that money came out of the general f that came out of the reserves um that we keep for Hurricane emergency disaster and he recouped most of that money um and just to to the note about the um what we did for the sandbags I was going to charge that dumpster fee out of our emergency fund um if we I don't know if we're going to break the threshold that I can get uh you know the four $400 I did from the previous storm because you have to have so much to qualify for a small project but if we do qualify for a small project I will be able to get the money reimbursed from feemale so as long as you have Reser if it's disaster related and you know you're spending money and you have you have reserves which we do in our general fund by resolution um you know if it's significant we can get a large percentage that back okay yes M Mato um we've got the minimum rate increase is $8 per month and the alternative alternative rate increase at $16 per month I would think maybe if we did $12 per month it would give us a little more Cush but not not as much as the alternative rate increase is there a reason you did the eight and the 16 oh the reason it was just in reflection to what we had previously I was just trying to match those proportions isn't the alternate uh waste managements would would have been the rate that we would have agreed to if we if we kept them one the 456 oh yeah that would have covered there I had a budgeted so what we currently have in our budget is enough to cover the 25% that they originally proposed and renegotiation so we actually budgeted a little higher this year okay and putting in a cushion I agree with Mr Chester if I drop dead how do I get that money back I'd have to come back and haunt all you I mean pay you I mean a little cushion I like big I'm absolutely against slush funds I mean I've seen that in athletics where people are like oh we have 30 grand okay any other questions or comments discussions Miss Livingstone is there any other reason why the management company would charge us say for instance when we initially moved here there were a lot of large items that were left over from the individuals before so we had Waste Management come out do a special pickup of large items does the city get charged for that in addition to the resident or is it the resident only now the way the contract works is um you set that up with the collection company and then like in our contract now it has the fees in the back and it's it's under bulk services um I think it was $57 per item was that just to the resident not to the the city doesn't encourage that's to the resident so the resident sets it up so you know if you have a lot of say refrigerators freezers that you need picked up you have to incur that cost as opposed to like your neighbor building into the having an extra fund for any Waste Management Services emergencies isn't going to happen then is that pretty much what I'm hearing so if the county has um debris collection contractors um that we piggyback so if there's an emergency it's over what you know waste manager your average collector can do um so you bring in you know special debris collection services and uh we piggy back those contract those contracts so they're at set rates that they can't like gou us for um and then because you used it for disaster Services um you subm all that back into FEMA for reimbursement okay thank you and you're prepared to raise the rate every year yes it it's it's just a calculation and a resolution okay all right uh if you're good with this i' I'd say that I'm good with this and uh what do the other council members think Miss Nao I'm fine okay Mr Chester I know where you stand Mr Roberts I'm good all right Miss Livingstone I'm good Mr Banker had the eight bucks I'm good all right no there you go be on the next agenda good deal all right uh any general business got a couple things you guys can go first you want me to start general buiness sure some different items I I put the uh the marina docs um attorney Mora and I went through the policy and to um added some word in add some definitions um we also went through the agreement that that the uh lenses signs um once they're off the waight list to rent a slip we added some things there changed some wording around so I provided that I sent that via email and uh provided a paper copy so I'd like um if you guys could review um and kind of give me any comments because we've been working work on this for I think we're over a year now we're close to it it's more than that to get more than two uh two complete terms okay so yeah I'd like to get it um for approval in a regular meeting um and then you know put it into to action so if you like to read through it carefully and uh make sure it makes sense and it's in line with what you know the council's vision is for the marina this would be voted on by resolution this would be um contract resolution right we would yeah we probably just do a a resolution setting forth the policies just to make it clear that it's adopted by the council okay what else um so bbcf of B Beach Community Foundation is looking to for their next project to be um doing a Veterans Memorial uh at Crossman Park so they'd like they they asked for me to to run this idea um as soon as possible so they could start trying to raise funds for this and um in general um the first phase would be to um clear out some of the the overground vegetation um in the middle of the of the little uh Island area where the shell is in the park um there's a small sign that says Crossman Park but you can't really even see it um with the Indian Hawthorne that's in front of it so they'd like to replace the sign with a bigger sign um dedicating the park and they're also looking to install an American flag and flag pole um and you know dedicate it to Veterans so um they're uh just wanted to get you know make sure it was good with the council's approval before they started um you know putting the word out to raise money for it Council comments like the idea don't like the idea like the idea yeah they love anything for veterans how big is the flag it be 25 foot gotta be big not as big as City Hall but we we have an ordinance on the size of our flags and they also um they also build in like an adopt the park opportunity for um somebody to you know put more landscaping for the shrubs and add to the park it's nice to see that we have someone who is uh contributing to the community doing H cool Mi uh how is the um kayak launch how's that being received um I notifi the B Beach Community Foundation that it's there um I I want to send something out um do we have it in the newsletter we did we should send something out because we just put in the uh the launch system that stabilizes the K we put that in today so maybe another uh note just to go out to let people know that it's there and usable and uh yeah so it has a handrail otherwise it's not usable for me it's got a handrail down to the catwalk it's uh 12 foot long catwalk four feet wide it's got a little tow rail on it and then uh there's a there's a head rail down the steps and then we installed the um it was counil member Z's idea he found it online but it's actually pretty cool it you can adust it with the tide but it's it's like a stabilizer in the water you get it right at where the water is at and you pull your kayak up on it and it gets close to the cockpit and and stabilizes it so you practically stand in the thing and rock it without feeling like it's got to tip over on you we also install the ladder right next to it so it helps you get in and out of the boat good you how uh how much room do you have for more bricks we have plenty of room for more room yes we still have to fill out our second square and then we were going to work out from there okay uh everyone encourage your friends and neighbors toh purchase bricks because how many that's how we're paying for this stuff oh how many bricks do you need to finish the second Square because you're not ordering them until you get a whole square right agenda yeah that's the agenda I think they're close um and I know they're looking at at switching they're trying to fill in the rest of the second but then they're looking to switch to a different vendor for new bricks um but I believe they're very close to having enough orders to do this F the second one yeah and then we'd be working on the third you don't know exactly two three 15 I'm just just I don't exactly I don't I can check for you so everyone's good with the Veterans Memorial right okay good deal yeah and that's you know we would present something more formal as the money was raised okay anything else oh um we've have a savings plan for carpet for this room um if you look at it closely it's starting to get some pretty good stains um I found Source wall contracts that would cost us uh roughly between 24 and 36,000 to replace the carpet all in this room up on the days um and it would be with Quality Carpet uh but you know we probably could get maybe a lower price once we decide the difference in price is based on the the not so much the quality of the carpet but the design pattern so the I guess they call it a knit time that it takes to produce the square um it costs more money if it's more machine time so if it's something we're interested in doing in the near future then I would like to I have a bunch of samples but I'd like to get the council's input on what they feel would be the best design in here and then we can find out what that cost would be and possibly um get some more quotes to find a good price how old is this this is from the the installation it was installed with the building so 2010 been how many events a year occur on this carpet in rentals or um and so we definitely have at least two to three months of where every weekend we have some kind of event um so I mean that's roughly 24 and then some sporadic I'd venture to say like mid-30s and what's the uh what would you say the average uh fee we are charging to make use of this room for an event most of them are uh nonresident and that is believe it's 1,600 Okay so we've made a lot of money off this carpet yeah yeah I don't have a problem with that at all you've gotten a lot of use yeah we've cleaned it several times and we we have our own little carpet cleaner that we really try to get that there's a big staying over there but it keeps coming back because it's I guess in the what will do that yeah this is this is our sand get the point this is our sand this is how we make Revenue yeah yeah 1600 that's pretty good K try to get the word out to get every weekend filled okay hey and you know we're we're looking to you know everything's going up like we said we're looking to kind of bring those res rate resid rate uh it's I want to say maybe four it's pretty low thought it was under 500 or something okay anything else you'd like to discuss that is it for now Council any general business yes Mr chess just a concern if um with our sand that's getting dumped in which is going well uh my wife went and took pictures to share um there are people then that don't want to wait in line and they're zipping through the neighborhood I was wondering if on the times that we're getting The Dumping if maybe we could have a deputy kind of hanging out there a little just to I don't mean out in the middle of the road on Gulf I mean where people are cutting through because they're running through stop signs and speeding part of the problem is that you never know which intersection is going to be open you may have experienced that already the the I'm going to tell you right now these trucks they have no etiquette at all they are uh they they're trying to get that sand in as fast as they can and get the heck out of here so they can go get a second load and come right back and do it all over again uh I I noticed that some of the drivers will purposely put a gap in front of an opening and others they don't care and it's it's you never know where it's going to happen I thought well maybe I could drop down to 19th and get out well they were now they're backed up all the that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about are the people that are trying to avoid the line they're cutting through our neighborhood I see the side roads and they're not they're ignoring stop signs and speeding yeah I I uh it's probably not a bad idea I don't want to have to make citizen you seen that in the early afternoon mostly Kyle I'm getting this information secondhand from My Wife and she's not the most reliable I'm just getting and he said that later so no that's I'm not worried about these guys that are done they're doing great I don't care about that I think that's wonderful in fact I wouldn't mind them do keep going all night 247 I think last week of my place it's not for too long see what I do is turn the fan on louder you can't hear any of the problem is a car making a rightand turn to avoid the traffic you have to have a resolution closing them streets to only residents only because how do you know who's making the right-hand turn and the guy might say well just like when Beller uh was closed for nine months Indian routs Road they had signs up no thorough far and everything like that and the cops were pulling our vice mayor got pulled out you know because cutting through wor about the traffic as long as they go to the speed and this is America that doesn't happen no I know but in a neighborhood it's Hey listen I go I'm not going to say anything about if this if this is a uh U the problem that I think it may be because we have the same issue whenever uh Clear Water these is backed up we have all sorts of issues like that maybe during this month because we probably have about a month of this left maybe it's not a bad idea to uh issue a directive to the Sheriff's Department just to patrol uh or watch the four-way yeah and I'm thinking it's probably that afternoon wave because early in the morning well in the morning when they're doing it in the morning is which my wife and I are concerned about are the people that are walking riding bikes walking their dog in the neighborhood you know they're and then you have people that are non-residents that are flying through there and they're in a hurry okay why they're avoiding the line and um so that um like s to eight time because they're lining up about before six and then you know once the Sun starts coming up they're turning in and it's something they're doing I have I've seen it I've seen what they're that occasionally a dump truck will be Crossing Golf Boulevard I mean sideways so I don't know if it's backing in or I I don't really know what's going on how they're how they're I guess they are backing in so they must have to seek assistance from either the contractor or the sheriff's department they pull up then they back in they drop their load and then they leave well whenever I think during that backing in process there must be a bottleneck that keeps stopping traffic every time someone tries to go in there and that's that's where the the and I I get we're going to have some issues I I I'm for it because this is going great I'm just concerned about I don't want somebody to get hit on side streets that are is out walking we have people that wear headphones and all sorts of crazy things so yeah I'll notify the captain okay all right that'll work what can you really do well they can do a directive patol so the on duty Deputy will take time during those hours and specifically sit there looking for Speeders and Speeders and and stop sign Runners yeah but I mean if I want to I'm if I live in tbck two and I want to make a right-hand turn on Street nothing they can do no right I'm just saying if there's somebody there maybe people will slow down a little and and we're doing what we can and and they are uh I've noticed that they just sit in their car and they're just sitting in the median and they're not doing anything extra ones yeah so maybe what they could do is maybe go on one of the side streets and sit there that's all I'm something like that yeah I don't expect just let them know that that we were having some complaints and what you can do thank you all right anyone else um gentleman came in there and drop these off it's about pumping I mean we just had another little storm last week and I went through the neighborhoods um the ones that were just redone waterers up and everybody's driveway inch and a half of rain we got inch and a half of rain high tide was only 2.6 and it went up 10 feet in some of these driveways and these are these are roads 12th Street just was redone if you look at what we're we're spending two with $2 and A5 million dollars in a bond plus storm sewer tax we need to scrap that whole thing because if you look at the streets that we're going to redo we're not replacing anything that's going to minimize flooding we're not doing anything to reduce the storm water surch um and the only way you're going to get rid of it is by pumping it out some way um it was disgusting last week on my street the Seventh Street third was horrible 12 Street was bad um I couldn't even get down some of them at first I mean your guys came out at the drains I mean but until the tide went down to about 2.2 that would have stayed in the streets and almost every street had issues because of the storm and the push of the tide so most streets that usually don't have that they Evacuate the pipes yours is the worst but those streets it was a unique event where the where you get that water pushed in and it wasn't so we were getting so much rain and I went through and I through it because I wanted to make sure um because I know that the that one's compromised that we know that from the camera there's a leak at the Joint so I tested the water that was um where I had the guys test the water um for salinity um I start keeping logs but I know that that one had almost direct um seawater coming into it it was a lot higher um solinity than the rest of the streets the rest of the streets were actually very very low because they're primarily Rainwater but um I do see on your street where a pump could be utilized it makes sense Street was was horrible too for um and nin Street was pretty bad right yeah so if you like I said I'm sorry sorry these guys didn't stay but if they could have spoke tonight or maybe bring them back in but we've had council members saying hey we don't want to replace pipes and all like that this whole project that we're spending money on is totally useless it's not going to get us anything at the end of the day the streets are paid fine okay and at the end of the day the next storm it's still going to flood so why are we doing this this is like insanity 101 well I say a lot of a lot of it is replacing the infrastructure especially where it is damaged um the inlets and the well I looked at all the pipe videos I don't see too many pipes that were damaged or whatever to be replaced now I don't know what the hell the top of the pipe looks like okay you see the inside of the PIP and it could be ready to collapse from the top but you don't know that till you're up Street we don't want to do that well they stop at each joint and they you know when they see something they go around um so there there's the middle of a pipe is compromised um when they lowered them in 20 50 60 70 years ago and they used chains or whatever and they they crack the outside service that's now rotted okay it's broken into the the metal rebarb and it's corroded it so we don't know how much damage could be five years down the road two years down the road six months down the road so with the all the video that we did get though the the engineers are looking at that and and they're putting that in the plans to address the major pipe issues um like I said with the pump it it I think it's something that can work but when you talk about overall what that cost is going to be it it it could be effective but I think um we really need to get an idea of just say like your street what kind of costs we're looking at because it's definitely a much more costly venture to have an automatic you're talking about $50,000 to do three to four streets um that would blow out about 2500 gallons per minute um but our Engineers has been talking to the we can put together estimat but I think we really the breaks on this all right so uh my take on it is that we are uh making everything pristine and we're doing our uh we're doing our responsibility that we've promised to the city uh we're making our storm drainage the best we possibly can and we're also refreshing uh the gutters and uh people are going to get some PVE uh pavement and uh uh we're just basically doing it all to the point to where it's as good as it can get with the type of infrastructure we're talking about so I absolutely have no problem with us moving forward with these projects I do like the idea of the pumps though uh so I think if there's any way possible that we could afford the pumps on top of that I I would never ever say that we are wasting our money on on storm drainage would you be uh willing to entertain them to come in and talk sure I would listen to an inter uh to a presentation but I think that the work session is a more fitting place and kind of uh a little confused as why they didn't hang around well they contacted me and I said you should have asked to get on the agenda before Friday that's what so I told and I didn't get it I was out I didn't get it till like five o'clock six o'clock Friday night and I wasn't gonna B bother this poor Saul any more than he's bothered already so I will tell M yeah I happen to be out riding around um during that rainstorm and um I drove down Gul Boulevard and I turned right there at CoCo okay in Indian Rocks Beach the reason why I turned there was because I uh needed to turn around and so I just picked the first side street I made the made another right and lo and behold they were foot and a half Deep in water okay okay so this isn't isolated to just Bair Beach this company will tell you that okay but this is 2023 and like you said we're doing the best we can with what we have but there is methods to progress and get rid of well what I can tell you is if we don't do this project and we we continue to have pipe and uh check valves failing uh your pumps aren't going to do any good what they're going to do is every time time high tide comes in it's going to roll in and it's going to flood streets in this particular case with the exception of 12 this was a rain event and the checks valve closed it did what it always does it rained like hell and filled your streets and I hate that that happened but uh I think we owe it to the community to at least take a look and see what they have to offer okay I have a question so when they pump the water and we're in high tide where are they pumping the water over the seaw right no the the check vales stop the the the high tide generally does not go over the seaw wall it it goes up to uh higher than the level of the check valve and if the check valve is not working it rushes in as soon as the tide drops down the check valve opens again and allows it to flow out and so as long is the sea water is not higher than the sea wall you can pump it out I I get that but because you were talking about the salinity there's certain areas where the water that is flooding isn't just rainwater that's the check I was I was know and so and the problem is when they built these homes on the water okay they already had the streets plumbed in right got okay but they put them in too low or too high I should say so then when they put the houses on there no one wants to throw the eminent domain in there and say hey we're got to rip this up and and raise this up so some of these check valves are below the two and a half mark gotcha on the tide but we can get 3.9 Tides here in fact when that ilda come up I think would you say four and a half 4.7 we had a surge or whatever yeah when you start getting over four feet is when you start to see it come all right and the valves will evacuate it's all about the head pressure so they even when the water is over the valve it's still if there's enough pressure it'll push that water out through the water because and you'll feel it when you're there it's not it's not hard seal who's going to take responsibility for adding getting these guys on the work session I can do it or yeah I'd like to coordinate um like I said the the engineers with with them and they've been talking okay so that um we can have them come in all right present something all right now I only have one item that I would like to bring up and uh you know I always hate whenever whenever I want to introduce something that sounds like we're over controlling or overreaching but in this particular case I want to see how the council feels about it uh whenever we have the last St we weren't draining properly and it wasn't because of our check vals or or pipes it was because all of this uh pine bark mulch was floating all over the place and finding the um the the fastest way the path of least resistance in plugging all of our drains um my question is is is is that something that belongs in Belair Beach should we seriously take a look at this and determine if if we should consider Banning it or am I just um I I don't have the problem in my yard I don't have a drain that I have to worry about but I know that others do and I saw it uh on the southern half of belir beach it was bad uh so thoughts my neighbor cross the street it looked like like Paul bun had a a wood chipper in their yard it it was so bad with debris in it I mean um I don't know where it all came from be be honest with you but I remember when I first moved in here I bought chips and my neighbor was Lynn and he goes you know they float really well and I go what the hell are you talking about he says well the first storm comes in you're GNA see it all over your yard that's why we put shells and rocks down here and like ding ding you know but you make a good point because it was a total mess with lower part well I saw entire streets after the water was seeded you couldn't see the streets or all of the the pine bark or m whatever you call that stuff can you ordinance that out or can you well I think we're aren't we past the moratorium now at the end of this month correct uh no I believe I believe that goes through October 2025 oh 2025 okay well it's something that we can definitely discuss and uh and keep it on our radar and keep bringing it up in broader sense s remember Bankers um communities constantly regulate what substrates can be used for perious and imperious surfaces um you can do it the challenge I think that you'd face from a regulatory standpoint here is how are you going to phase it out or you know site people for it if it's it's been down if you if we did regulate it but I'm not saying you couldn't just saying I think that'd be your bigger challenge but as a legal can you generally speaking absent what we presently have from the legislature yes I would say that uh uh I I don't know how you would regulate it obviously if you had new mulch then it would be easy to flag or something but uh I think once you stress the importance of this problem to the community as a whole uh more people will switch over um eventually it RS turns the dirt and then you get weeds yeah it's just it's point I mean it's you know less than a year what's that my are less than a year it's turning it doesn't doesn't last long all right well next year if if uh everybody still feels the same way we'll discuss this again anything else that it for General business do I have a motion to adjourn I make a motion because the files are on 40 minutes so do I have a second all in favor I you oppos all right good night everyone that charger"
