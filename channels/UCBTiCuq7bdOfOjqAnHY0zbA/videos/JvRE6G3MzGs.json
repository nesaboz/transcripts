Seal of the city of Miller Beach to be affixed on the seventh day of November 2022. [Music] not for a proclamation thank you for everyone to served I greatly appreciate it [Applause] next we're up to item number four we have a law enforcement report Sergeant McKnight with Pinellas County Sheriff's Department good evening I have the September 2022 before tonight for the first page of the report the UCR property and personal crimes there was no report to living in any crimes on this image usually there's one or two zero is awesome exactly for the second page is the arrest report there were a total of four people arrested in federal Beach during the month of September 2022 on seven different charges and all four of those were traffic related stocks the third page of the report is the Deputy activity page there were a total of 754 events in the city of Butler Beach during the month and 879 deputies responding to those events the final page is the attraction citation and the analysis there's two crashes for the month in Beller Beach and a combination of 195 citations and questions Council yeah okay I guess we're all kind of willing to find out what happened in October with that massive Halloween party from what we found out can you give it brief descriptions some I mean most of the people that we talked to have talked about it but some may not know what went on sure sure so from what we found out um I believe the address was uh 1800 or 1880 uh there's a juvenile high schooler that lives at that residence and that person invited a few friends over and like high school parties start it starts small and then other kids talk especially on social media which eventually things up very quickly so then it ended up being around 200 some kids showed up for a party on the beach and their Halloween costumes and that's what the problem was with all the parking and everything else going on at the beach accesses and the side streets well the deputy Perez and I our president here tonight for working that night and we came up here with about three or four other deputies and I did the best we could to quickly move the kids along and yeah I have a question were there any arrests or tickets there were some parking citations uh issued there the exact number I do not know and there were no arrests yes um I live on 20th Street and first of all I'd like to command the response by the deputies and how they handled the situation um I actually got a call from a neighbor across the street and said well you see what's going on I said you know what's going on went down on my porch and there were literally every side of my street is far gone and hundreds of kids were walking like zombies watching their phone but um it was an interesting situation to handle like I said so the 19th Street parking area was completely packed and that's where the first Deputy went and I won't give you all the details but I thought the way that that Deputy handled the initial wave that was coming through and then like the deputy said there were three or four other cars that showed up and I just thought it was handled extremely professionally and they did a phenomenal job of being able to get rid of more than a couple of hundred weirdly aggressed people walking around the street so thank you very much any other questions or comments thank you very much I appreciate it thank you thanks Phil here's code enforcement report good evening Council uh chef and citizens of color reach Steve cochner for the record again if you look at the log that was submitted at a very busy month mainly work a lot on some ordinances dealing with the weeds and the brush and the bushes myself and Kyle refer are working diligently with commissioner Roberts on on getting most of these problems resolved Kyle and I spoke briefly before this meeting and what we're going to do is we're going to go Street by Street and we're going to start working on a lot of the complaints we don't receive too many complaints as far as the weeds that brush are concerned but we do notice a lot of or I do notice a lot of the bushes that are over the foot Mark so we are going to be working on that very diligently and trying to get that result as quickly as possible what other issue that we had last or this past month was I had checked out on a Third Street lady was having some work done unlicensed contractors and basically they were stopped work and told her we're not giving your money back we're not going to finish the job I ended up talking with the contractor she got all of her money back and she got to keep the materials that they were doing for the house and they came to a nice agreement so that was actually turned over to our economic crimes division they are investigating the construction company and see if there's any past practices that they've had problems with so as that develops I will keep you all informed I had another case where a lady had put down eight thousand dollars that work done contractor never showed up made one phone call next day she had her eight thousand dollars back and again that also went to work you know crime so they're aware of that other than that I'll stand for any questions thank you nice job yes first of all I've got to use no impact on you but um I brought up last month about eight or four hours of Drive uh actually in our packet I don't know he got this it was from Prime Escape an evaluation of that tree um I can't direct you only just is it now if you can answer this question Mr Mayor or maybe it's a City attorney is it proper to put a motion on the floor right now to approach section 22-31 under the definition of hazardous conditions and nuisances it hasn't been specifically the Hazardous tree Provisions in that and have the deaf being go out and start assigning that what I would like to do is to write that question uh you know no no no that is not on this body's job you've passed the code um separation of powers dictates that the executive branch in your form city manager and code enforcement inspector they are they clearly uh reviewed it they've done diligent State and however they choose to proceed is is that the city commission does not direct whether when or in what man or code enforcement occurs Beyond allocating resources to it and setting the policies that are being produced well it didn't I don't have a sitting chart in front of me but it's citizens Council cinematic a lot of questions so we also have the pleasure of the citizens and we serve your country absolutely and in my further reading of it we can direct the city mag Council you cannot direct any of the employees under the city management but we can give directions to the city manager and our secretary that's the way I read the charter am I incorrect there uh no you def you certainly direct the city manager on a day-to-day basis your direction is to the city manager to enforce the city's code the city manager is doing that has done that is has confirmed with me if this Council so desires to involve itself in code enforcement in the manner of delineating when and what Banner particular code measures will be enforced it may do so with all the attended risks that come with involving yourself in that in that scheme I would say ordinarily it is the province of a council to say we have passed this code we have tasked you with doing with enforcing our code and um and then that's a performance issue but if I would counsel against the council or commission involving itself in particular matters um and for a number of concerns they can extend to protecting you folks not just um not just the the ordinary separation of power but also protection is important to you in in the city and what your function should be I I appreciate you protecting us but in this letter it cites about four to five pounds for this could cause a catastrophe okay so I don't believe he uses the word catastrophe but I'm familiar with the doctor and well severe risk all right so I would be more I'm more concerned with the citizens that live around that tree that I have at this Council uh being overstepping its boundaries a little bit not not getting into code enforcement or with the city manager but I really do believe in motion will be properly what they're telling me now ultimately this body conducts its business however wishes you're asking for my advice I give advice you don't need to um to conduct yourselves in Conformity with my advice at all times ultimately that's it's this body's design we this city moves by the will advisor yeah you've asked for my advice and I've given it in our perspectives may not always align but I respect that I do in fact work for you folks and whatever you folks to direct oh people we will proceed hopefully this wind storm coming doesn't take this tree down basically going on now for months all right visit Mr Baker um you've asked for his opinion or you asked for my opinion I'm passion to him he hated the information and uh and now we all have it to uh to consider that being said Do we have any other comments for the other question you spoke about the economic crimes unit is it possible that they have a list of contractors that do not meet the law that we can keep here at City Hall too if anybody asks we can't recommend conference right sure show you a list of people that are operating legally right if they go under the Pinellas County Construction Licensing Board website there's a I think that's not easy for our people and I mean is it possible to have a list here um I would I'd have to check I would say no because again it depends they would have to pull case numbers and stuff but I will tell you that going under the licensing board website is very easy and all you have to do is search contractor put the contractor's name in there and it comes up it tells you if they're active inactive suspended I've showed a few people how to do that but um that would be the the best place if possible how can we like just keep the the I guess a listing up there to say here's the website if you have questions about your contractor just go to this website and type in the name of the company yeah they can do that I mean it's very easy to do I'm just saying for the citizens right you know they can't float around and think that that would be an excellent topic to put on the next newsletter just to get that link out there so that everyone has it and then just about everybody in town do we have any other comments thank you very much thank you have a great evening you too thank you attorney s I just thank you Mr Mayor briefly uh one of the uh to address the point that was raised earlier this evening at the last meeting this body gave authorized the city attorney's office to begin negotiating contract terms with Mr reefler we have exchanged iterations of that contract I have provided both the initial draft and revised draft to the council with a summary of those points again I always whenever I provide a summary I just wish to reiterate resource documents control over this key summaries there for your ease of reference so you're not left wondering what systems so that process remains ongoing and ultimately once the parties reach mutually agreeable terms we will be Mr Aretha would present presuming we reach mutually agreements Mr reefer will send that to the office of manager of a full-time basis as indicated in previous reports I continue to remain in the daily contact with Kyle and Patty on on an array of matters otherwise I'm happy to answer any questions now Council all right look what I would like to do is we can wrap this up move forward I'm assuming you're getting feedback I've not received any feedback and ultimately from the if you mean as it relates to the interim manager's contract to be manager I've not received any one-on-one feedback and since it will ultimately be a contract that the body would approve it'd be best to have that feedback provided in in the public hearing setting so that way if if members able for example gives me a number and then you could be a number just a salary is the easiest thing that I'm not trying to reconcile conflicting things I can get a consensus I don't wish to get a consensus outside of the meeting so it's my understanding that there were talks of a workshop in the coming weeks either either next week or three weeks from now I think there's supposed to be potentially three meetings this month and one of those will be it that was when I briefly spoke to Kyle this morning we were talking about what that timeline would look like ultimately enforces at this body's discretion I think that next week would be a great time to just go ahead and add it to the agenda and we see if we can hash through this and get it locked out so that we can vote and to avoid any you know just confusion or the way that assumptions kind of fill the void this wasn't brought in science and that you know you folks put a lot of thought into the contract that was put before another candidate obviously those terms were very specific to that candidate but the mold was there they were you know I shaped it based on President realities and anticipating comments obviously Mr riesler framed and Basin part of his perspective as an employee and also the difference being that he is an existing employee and so you know somebody coming in may not have approve leave for example and how that how that is dealt with and so those sorts of elements are are in the draft and ultimately for you folks to consider but I don't wish to give the impression that I you know that this has been you know the yeoman's job or something some incredibly difficult task it's just time and ultimately getting the input of the body that can only be public thank you Mr Roberts I was just going to recommend the next Workshop we could work through that any other questions or comments for this tomorrow thank you very much Mr Moore except interim City manager's report is to read where you're at thank you mayor and Council to start off the 12th 13th in May from our project we have and agenda item tonight possible change or whatever approval by Council that still has a completion of date in January at this point with the extensions that received for the hurricaneian delay the Gulf Boulevard undergrounding project we are still in the phase of going door to door to the houses that require easements for Duke Energy I put together based on the information from utility consultants in Florida giving more information on how the products what stage we're in the project what what's involved and a little bit about the easements that were requesting so I plan on putting on the website just to make it available for people for reference on these seven Street Renovations Century program in 16th Street sea level renovation we are more than halfway complete on that project the it still has a January completion database some of the time the game for the project I went ahead and started soliciting bids for the fishing dock so hopefully as soon as that season was completed with the professional some residents are [Music] uh the 17th and 18th Street stormwater project I currently have that on hold and the reason for that is that we have the assistance advisory committee uh looking at possibly a bank loan to fall into five other projects all the time we're putting together a support and proposal for Council to consider and we're just getting some more information on what the current loan grains are what looking at for the future the code enforcement analysis project we just met on November 4th we pulled in all our results for the survey the team discussed analyzed the results we kind of came up with a game plan on how we'd want to address what we heard from the residents council member Roberts and I are going to try to get something together get that on the November 14th work session agenda so that we can get some consensus from Council on what our ideas are a plan is to disseminate information back to the residents to let them know what we what we heard from them what our plan is and to have a follow-up you know they walked in a year but the city what our results are based on what we do the um City Hall generator I recently even touched base with the company that's given me a sourceful quote based on materials labor costs our project cost has increased so we budgeted I believe it was two years ago 240 000 from that project now we're looking at a number of 281 000. so that's something I know we've talked we're talking about making improvements to Emergency Management so this kind of goes hand in hand with that uh this is important to pursue or want to reconsider this kind of money and work instead of in other aspects of Emergency Management you think we should go back and reboil we can uh we can go back and read quote we might be able to get something a little lower um that's I can collect them forty thousand dollars yes um we didn't see an increased Battle of people and this was kind of a form we saw a lot of the increases um I can get some new fresh quotes this company specific it was a lot lower I'm not managing it's gonna be high I can just verify that sometimes we get quotes So um the sourceful quote you know that that doesn't require us to go out to be able to go out to bed sometimes I'll tell you one number and then the number's a lot higher or just something to consider that I think uh have we explored a lot of these hospitals businesses that have generators they will terminate them after a certain amount of years because insurance yet caterpillar is a big generator company they take them back and rework them and they re-guarantee them anymore and we looked at a huge generator option which would probably be about it has caused because I don't I don't see the big need for it here I mean of course the power we've ever needed but I mean it's going to work just as well as a new generator we could say we have the money Association my knowledge would be able to look at any uh you know Green refurbished generators but that's something I can ask you to the main vendors if they if they do it or if they know source to do that thing again because tearing them down journalism and do everything you know and there's in my opinion they're as good as though as long as they uh make a warranty okay the city hall City wall I am getting a budgetarian number or a quote from the current company that's doing our seawalls now to see where they come in and then another company that this historically meant for Christ so I'd like to make sure that our thirty thousand dollars that we have in the budget is adequate to to pay for it stupid thing um I reached out to you I believe it was like a week and a half a week about a filming requests on Hibiscus Avenue got some feedback from Council the majority was okay with it once we talked and worked with the production requests to get into a minimal impact on the City traffic and the time that it may impute traffic on hibiscus So currently where it stands we have the whole production and whole operation taking place in less than two hours the actual feel more shot that they're going to do or even involving a person by something down the road and a band I I am taking a shot was the last enhancement of 90 seconds so when they do it they're just going to do a screen Outlet get their footage and be done with it we ask that they they originally requested I think it was I think that sounds right for parking on Bell Island right away by the seawall we got them to get down to two vans in a box truck and I asked them to pull up off of the road so that their house on the traffic down at all they trust concerns of the box truck maybe tilted too much of the equipment so that we agreed that they could drop their equipment and park the box truck in the marina they'll be able to get the Vans off of the road I spoke with them today they uh people that were going to communicate about our residents they put tags on the doors they got one call from a resident of just inquiring about what it was since I explained if they were okay with it so I'm hoping that it is both positive so that we can sort of figure out some parameters to work with if we can get these requests in the future so that we can support the local economy um the I headed out that tree assessment I was able to get it completed by an independent arborist he did it on Saturday so I got the report late this weekend I just wanted to share that with you for you to read this what he was growing up as kind of make decisions on what you feel you know where we're at with that I mean there's there's things we can discuss further from in talking to the arborist and how that they how they do it I had to keep them off of the private party so the property so they had to do his assessment from Eastern the probability it's called another assessment that's about you know making tell you some basic information about retrieving doing your best guess what I gathered was the baby get risk a little bit more like I believe use the word moderate on the scale of low moderate high and extremes so we're going to be a one or two or four um there's a somewhat likely uh a chance of failure but that is um given the weather typical to this area and then when it comes to Hurricane of course winds the take I got from this day any Tree in this area has been potentially fell into hurricane of course wins so that's kind of not something that they try to actually put a number two depending ground saturation so it's I wanted to get that report because we talked about having a report done by the city that was you know completely independent of anything else we heard get a pretty thorough report that we can analyze and decide we're going to go in there I think you think it would be beneficial to the counselor just to receive what's what's next what's what's the stage of or any any tree that's in this condition and if we uh if we determine that we actually don't have a mechanism in place to deal with this and the council needs to get to work immediately and come up with and that will address these these problematic trees I I don't want people anyone particular property or or a homeowner but if there's not something in place already we definitely should have something to address this right and I from talking with people who are cities that have more aggressive ordinances to our City attorney I currently don't believe we have enough to act based on what we can what we can analyze from a drive-by survey or a tree and we can't go on Direct routing we really can dive deep into like what they call the level three of the analysis of a tree under if it was our aluminated um I think where we're at now it's going to involve a little bit more language in our code it's to accomplish with maybe during this time it sounds like a perfect item to add to the next work section questions for history yes uh under 22 31 Azure is tree shopping any tree that is injured terminally diseased today the danger of flowing or adjacent properties for any tree that interferes with utility services creates unsafe Vision clearance with cause of damage to the public Aquarium there's utilities for that tree control there's at least three houses paid before I don't know what we really need and I'm reading right from uh I think maybe it'll work that's where we can compare other city codes and sort of the language they use and steps that they take so they're very you can review our code and modify it to be something that might be more successful in accomplishing their goals I understand that it's just uh the longer this awaits the more risk it is any other questions or comments yeah I think Kyle I think it's a great idea that the citizens advisory committee is going to combine those multiple projects for obvious reasons it's going to save the city money clearly there's going to be some interest involved which is money we're going to have to pay but my I'm confident by combining those five projects a we're going to get more contractors bidding on it which is always going to save your money is more competitive I think it's a great benefit to the citizens because instead of dragging out the construction for months and months and years possibly all be done pretty much at one time which is a great thing also we're getting it done under one contract instead of stretching it out which is going to increase costing as well so great idea my question is off the top of your head you know what streets if you don't know how to stop you later but you know the streets are going to be combined clearly we've got a 17th and 18th 17th 18th 19th 20th good night and then Morgan on 25th you know and velocity it was 14th through 16th Amendment but yeah we'll get all that together okay all right and we have some other numbers and some other assumptions that we're making based on uh I have called some contractors that have been reported and work in the area and kind of pitched in onto it you know what would be a a reasonable Assumption of where we could save these projects together and another thing I calculated with all the street surfacing to be included with each of these projects in that area based on our street index and curving right so we kind of laid it all out we're working with a scope is going to um we want to get all the loan numbers together but we'll have something to present to you perfect thanks and uh I just want to give you an update the uh we had a storm that's coming the counties reached out in one situation report so far they're going to do a partner call tomorrow for the storm system the cold so we'll stay tuned on that you guys okay um and then as an update for the tower we we did get an application submitted I have an engineer ing some of those we have important the engineers comments are on that permit we're starting to be over there when you get our application came in and kind of a week before the last show that there were towers that Tower was affected were the magistrated here it was about two months ago and there was there was a fine run for that for that time once we got the complete application submitted I held I held the fine for now if you have a question no I was I was just going to clarify the streets but it's irrelevant the streets they're going to um try to walk into this stormwater project pretty mainly if anyone's in right so the 17th 18th 19th 20th 9th Street 22nd 23rd Morgan the 25th [Music] there was an actual emps in our master plan but there was one person that made that but we felt like that's kind of one that is a really high in demand or probably about to focus on now and then when we talk about value out of the station Godfather exercise the next stage of planning to take place for that it would be very nice to have a few years what we didn't discuss so I hope you're able to work out any other questions or comments for Mr rieckler thank you seven City Clerk I just have two updates the one is the appeal that was made for the home to be built with three habitable floors and that was denied Mr riesler and Mr Moore were both at that hearing and then the update on the satisfaction of lean for 16th Street and that we did receive the confirmation that it was released and released so that's complete I noticed that there's no ownership on the agenda items this time most of them I can pick I can take out but um just hoping we can turn back on in the next thing yes um most of them I I didn't think were had a sponsorship or but definitely yes of course yeah any questions or comments yeah have you guys um yes you wanted to have discussion of it and discussion has to be on at a workshop so it's already on the workshop for November 14th at Agenda it's on there yeah okay what else thank you Peg welcome all right now we are up to item number eight which is a public hearing consideration of ordinance 22-04 which is the second reading Mr morrisoned happily Mr Mayor this is ordinance number

a second second by Floyd Roberts all right we have only one candidate and he's never keep also known as them but this at this time I'd like to ask Miss Keith if she would like to introduce herself to the council the big heat um 109 Harbor 109 Homewood Drive um we found a house here for just like 20 years and I've been part of the parks and rec board in the past and I'm really happy to be part of the team again do we have any questions for this week this isn't a big deal but I just noticed Patty that the subject says appointments are often a member to member is that an important you know change that either thank you yeah I didn't change it from the last time I see that thank you Lloyd I'm sorry any questions any questions thank you very much thanks okay since we only have one candidate uh ready you would like to roll combo all right councilmember Baker yes council member Notaro council member Roberts aye council member Shirley I'm sorry council members Abel yes vice mayor Shirley mayor goddess aye [Applause] and we're on the item 13. consideration of changeable work options on the 12th Street 13th Street and Bay Drive school and Water Project do I have a motion to proceed motion made by Brian tanker do I have a second second by Leslie pantero Mr reefer would you like to explain this to us Okay so it all started um paragraph there is a pike we discovered in Richmond it was a 15-inch electrical RCP type that was discovered that was not indicated on the survey or previous engineering plans when the design was done the fenced the discovery of this pipe of the determined that there were two options and I was based on the fact that it was directly underneath the curve on the north side of the Wall Street and there's only so much room to work with we camera that pipe in a nice set of building to each of the council members to show the commission but by the time that we discovered um so the engineer has come up with two possible options you can do in this situation option one involves removing the it's 112 linear feed of the existing 15 inch RCP and that involves a cost of 3 468 and yeah part out from one reader to install a 12 inch c900 PVC for the estimated cost of 14 000. 14 000 40 so that would be the total total estimating cost thousand Runner the other option is to solely just remove the pipe and you're not placing the engineer dual Associates which is an outlet or sepi Incorporated their recommendation was to to do option one and to replace it with a pipe which would be a 12 inch pipe the the maintain the characteristics the underground stormwater keeping a system I do have the engineer Al carrier who made the recommendation as far as and he's here to answer questions um specifically towards his reputation and then I put together the numbers of where we're at it in the project this can be paid for on the 10 contingency budget that we get a lot of for the project currently our contingency balances 44 297 this will put us contingency balance of 26 788 and speaking with the engineers the program project do not anticipate I was running with a contingency budget but that I cannot be guaranteed because we do not know exactly what's going around it we ran into a lot of conflicts a lot of service lines once they uncomfortable so that's kind of where we're at but like I said Mr carrier is here to answer any questions you have and I included the approximate pipe location it's probably easier to see an additional document but those recommendation for this for this options and then the two proposals that are presented by the Construction Company all right so would you mind giving this your name again I know Mel carrier with uh Stephanie incorporator we were doing Associates and um we were purchased by second back in March of this past year we did notice the um the dueling Associates at the time took over the project from your performer engineering firm um kind of ministry the discovery had already been done by a local surveyor and he did not pick up the extra pipe that was in the ground the system drains through What's called the CDs unit and you guys had to pull the permit from smoke mud I think about 20 years ago when we reevaluated the system we're looking at getting rid of the CDs unit but there was still some life to the I guess she receives great dollars at the time from Swift Mud and there's still some life left in that cdsu so the district's foot fund would not allow us to improve movement um all the plans that we had seen did not show that extra pipe that it's a parallel pipe to the CDs unit that takes water out through the sea level when we discovered the extra pipe um we didn't want to we didn't want to go through a process of removing the pipe and finding out that the system didn't have the capacity to take all the water through the CDs unit so looking at it what they can it's there for a reason let's not offset the apple cart we're just going to leave the pipe or the Integrity of the pipe conveys through the pipe just leave it there and leave an attack um the existing pipe I believe you all looked at it as Kyle mentioned it's a pretty poor Shake it's got a lot of cracking you can see the joints of displace slightly and then there's rebar showing through the pipe when the pipe was actually set years ago they used to call lift holes they would need a little pocket of concrete out from the top of the pipe expose the rebar and Dave use that to perhap the pipe and locate it and then use the contractor would come back in and patch that pipe that hole almost all those lessons are either deteriorated or getting ready to fall in and so it's our recommendation to go ahead and remove the pipe um we're downsizing it slightly to a 12 inch pipe the pipe that's in the ground is an elliptical pipe and there's only about four inches of cover which is probably another reason why the pipes cracking there's not enough bedding on top of the pipe to um securely protect the pipe from traffic the curb that it does go on there's only about four inches in thickness where typically it's between seven and nine so our recommendation let's let's put a new pipe in a c900 pipe it's a 12 inch bike will give us adult cover over the pipe that we're composing and we'll still have that conveyance that the secondary routing for the water if needed thank you a question from the council yes sir um you're going to remove concrete plate I put a PVC pipe in there C9 and you're only going to have four inches of a overlay on top no the reason why we're putting the 12 inch c900 pipe is because the existing pipe only had four inches of cover with the c900 we'll have about eight and a half inches of cover because you have three inches of outside diameter on the car plus plus the belt and um here's a strange question for me why can't we use c95 total strange you can but it's expensive it's a more expensive option than just using concrete it's more expensive today yes okay all right I'm aware of that Mr Jose yeah I noticed uh going through the estimates uh price does not include palm tree removal and replacement are we looking at uh concrete removal and replacement okay I had a question that means it's probably not ask it anyway what happens if we do nothing my gut's telling me that you're going to have Street flooding Upstream in that CBS unit so that CDs unit works it's called a centrifugal deflection device so what this warmer gets in there and spins in the solids remove themselves from the flow screen and settle into the bottom of this song that creates what they call head loss right so it takes energy to to remove those those particles out of the stormwater stream the system is so shallow and so flat that I believe that during the bigger Stone runs it's going to back the water up into the into the streets Upstream of that um CBS unit what makes me kind of think maybe that secondary pipe was there for a reason maybe it was part of the original design maybe it's an afterthought it's not on the original players but somebody might have gone out there and put that in at the same time they can organizations they might have saw the issues for construction I don't know it's just my gut it's just from what I've seen from experience so in your opinion we're moving it entirely is safe or bad leaving it as is yes you don't want to leave that interesting pipe there you're going to be putting in new curves um new asphalt I don't know what the life left is in that pipe with construction activity around it there's obviously more damage that's being done to it with heavy equipment going over it and not being compacted on all sides it's been exposed so my suggestion is get rid of the old pipe put in a new bike and even if it was plugged eventually the street would start it starts hanging is that right you could you could plug it typically um my recommendations never leave a pipe in the street even if it never abandoned it we always flow we'll fill it we can't remove it so that is an option um not my recommendation my recommendations get it out of there put it in place are you a uh where's your degree from do you have a professional engineer what's your background I mean can you give us a brief synopsis because you're seeing a lot of my belief is you will do that it's like I don't know you I don't know your qualifications make sure it's briefly go over that um graduated from University of South Florida been in the business almost 30 years now I'm a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida I'm also a registered land surveyor in the State of Florida um purchased dual Associates from C printable back in 2006 and we recently just sold the company back in March I've worked for the city of Clearwater for almost 10 years I was their assistant director of engineering oversized stormwater and Environmental Management section um that's with a couple of private firms before that was with Hillsborough County for a short step um honestly I didn't like to drive so I left Hillsborough County went to Clearwater and then was at Clearwater for 10 years since 2006. okay therapy is still current yes okay before I go to the citizens any other comments yes Roberts uh last time we talked a little bit about the possibility of errors in emissions Insurance did anybody can give an opportunity to speak with anybody about that the City attorney and um it didn't based on what happened and the way the contract was transferred it didn't seemed like it would fall under that comparison emissions do you guys have errors and Emissions Insurance yes did you have an opportunity to talk with the insurance company but it would in my opinion it wouldn't qualify for errors of emissions the error wasn't done on behalf of our work or our expertise it was um the pipe wasn't seen by the surveyor we relied on that information there was no atlases you guys didn't have any atlases of what was in the ground at the time we did just hadn't discovered during construction is that something you could take a moment and contact your insurance company and see what they say that's true what would you be looking for I'll be looking for the insurance company to cover the cost of what we have to do now because we want to wear that again in my experience um just because the pipe wasn't there or wasn't seen in the Forefront um even it was okay let's go back if it was seen we would recommend that you remove a replacement seat you would have incurred that cost anyone um this isn't something that's above and beyond not only taught them you know the fact that this is a change or you're saying you don't think the change over the cause had this been inclusive of the original contract bid your your feelings would be the exact same cost then as it is now no so what I understand where you're getting at now if it was on the plans originally then the cost would have been more in line with the other prices that are on the on bit sheet at the original time of of um so what we didn't want to pursue then would be the delta so if you were able to say is five dollars initially and now it's eight because it's a change order because we didn't know about it it's only like three dollars back and to the extent legal was asked to confer with the city manager on this my insight wasn't that it's impossible to pursue those sorts of things under certain circumstances who is factually understanding that and as I understood and explained here as well the engineer who you're speaking assumed the Project based on approach based on work performed by a different company a different entity that surveyed not theirs and so their insurer is unlikely to ensure the work of a third party and so were we to pursue that it's not that it could possibly never be pursued we'd be pursuing it against another entity and then the resources extended in that regard to identify pursue and potentially make legal claims against that was not at least as we initially discussed it not where we thought the resources were best out to identify that former former former surveyor whose work was done submitted Clinton with them have them pursue it the amount of resources allocated to that was not seen as opponent was just a cost benefit and sometimes as we know but insurance companies and we all love them would be um you know you you followed with your insurance company typically they they would say well that's not our deal they would go after the other insurance company we don't care who they go after just as long as we get something like that that's the way of putting that I think the bottom line is how many hours would it take to your firm to address this matter and he had to go to court I didn't quantify it with in excess of right just going forward because with my initial impression and speaking with the manager the question is I guess I think I haven't had a chance to speak and thank you Mr Kerry for providing all this information I don't I don't know how anyone can have any liability with the city itself doesn't have documentation of what's in the ground there's there lies the problem I've been in your shoes many times trying to construct something with no documentation from the city and it always falls back on the contractor and uh you know there's there's no way to foresee this but my question is along the lines with Kyle we've got the money in a contingency on their right we haven't we still have remaining 20 nearly twenty seven thousand dollars in that fund does that budget also include our Paving and how we got numbers for paying the storm system running as it was more efficiently with a smaller pipe possibly and uh so we still have nearly twenty seven thousand dollars sitting there for other errors other we should have uncovered anything else that might come up at this point would you agree Mr Perry anything else at least on the one size there's a major increase in the price of something right so that the north side of the the project um we to contractor has gone on has verified survey we had some issues with the survey on the South Side um the invert elevations of the elevations of the pipes and the inlets and stuff were a little bit different um the contractors getting different information that was actually done in the server we went back and we checked um I just found out from TNR construction inspector this afternoon that she got verification that the information they got from the contract with the owner of survey is pretty consistent with what um the Sarah rare has there's a little there's a few nuances a little differences but it looks like it's something we can deal with and you have a little more fall if you will on that side of this the street so we have a little more play to get the pipes in the ground if we've come across in the conflicts but I'm United we're not anticipating another concept like this Community questions for Mr carrier so the uh we had the pranks video right so in my mind I'm having the difficulty understanding what now that the dude is riding around inside the bikes how in the world could they have not seen the other bike I can answer that um so when they have they go in on 12th Street they were all being able to get into manholes on the south side of the street okay and they look at the cross pipes they were so full of sounded it because couldn't get they couldn't pull the grates on the north side of the street because they were afraid that they were just probably right at that point you have to remove the boxes of the structure so that's pretty much how it happened so the the video equipment never actually went in that area they never you know and and to their knowledge they thought that it was only cross types so they looked down to each of those pipes okay and they saw the sediment but they never they didn't want to go down in the pipe because they leave the graves falling apart okay all right we've heard Mr carrier's opinion his recommendation Mr reefer what is your recommendation I support the engineers decision all right before we go to a vote and you can take this to the citizens what do you would like to comment on their show all right I'm going to come back to Frank Baker for the last word all right um I agree uh I went out and looked at that job before being voted and some of those cohorts were collapsed I mean you couldn't see that all right so apparently what we're going to do is we're going to take a roll call boat and the council you're going to have to vote for option one which is uh complete removal and replacement I had 17 508.18 or option two which is removal only at the cost of 3 468.18 ready please call me council member Banker council member Notaro [Music] council member Roberts council members Abel optional vice mayor Shirley option one mayor Gaddis option one so often one I had six votes options to receive an option number one thank you and thank you very much all right so we're going to number 14. let's do authorizing interim city manager to execute assignment assumption and agreement with Novation before we begin do I have a motion to authorize president do I have a second second second by Frank finger Mr wrinkler so uh this this uh execution of the assignment assumption agreement with the patient was uh based on the fact that uh trans system corporations which recently encouraged purchase at the engineering Construction Incorporated this is very similar to what happened 70 engineering purchase of Google and Associates it's 2000 June 2020s of earlier this year the original engineering service agreement was as early as sign is executed September 6 2019. and uh so I'm requesting included the notification email from the data that was given this information the review of The City attorney has reviewed all this information and then that being said as we discussed in the prior meeting very close to who's advertising and forget about a month's time thank you next time you speak you might get a little closer than like yes I'm struggling Behavior my solution was made by less than material would you like the discussion I think it's pretty quick um [Music] uh any other comments from the council let's go to the citizens all right so we're back to the council I think we can just do this with a Voice vote all in favor all right we're authorized thank you all right we are now on to number 50 consideration of the procedure to build a vacant City Council seat begin I'll make a motion motion motion negative five Mike's able to have a second sentence all right I put this one in the help of having the procedure document you have in front of you is pretty much the same format that was used the last time there was a vacancy of the field Council has a right to select a replacement member just about any way we see fit too so long as we agree on women I'm asking for approval of this method to be used on the November on November 28th whenever we elect a replacement council member for vice mayor Council commissioner where we've already we've made the motion to approve it and now we're just going to have a discussion about it because everyone on the same page as a technical matter Mr Mayor we've made the motion to have to discuss place the item on the table for discussion the member Baker is moving to approve the proposal okay all right I apologize now there's a motion on the table to approach this second second one Roberts you just do it all in favor all in favor of the comment apologies no you're right you're right I'm sorry this is kind of got a little weird citizens yes sir the general answer 22nd Street I'm a little confused if you already have a procedure of replacing and appointing a city council member why does it even have to be discussed again if it's a valid standing instruction or policy procedure in the currency look I don't understand why you're even having to have a discussion about them experience I think I can answer if you might be my guess the your Charter sets forth at the city council Council yes sorry the city council has the ability to determine how it will approve agency under across Administration they they selected a policy during a precise vacancy it was not established as a standing policy it's not codified as a resolution or an ordinance that composition of the council having changed this council is well within its discretion to determine how it wishes to proceed you've said you've recognized that there was nothing that was problematic for your purposes about that procedure and you wish to endorse it for this instance but it was not a standing codified policy in your ordinance's resolution it was an informal series of documents adopted by previous Council to proceed and brought forth again so had you folks decided by way of example that you just wish to do it by drawing Lots or taking uh you know picking names out of a hat and ignoring that prior proceeding you could have done as much as well on the fact that you that the policy holds this really in your discretion thank you for a clarifying that for us that clears it for me too I mean I I was just a little confused about how it went something tonight thank you thank you thank you okay so uh I'm a little confused about the procedure here because we had a motion to approve the procedure that then we moved right over to it's actually it's it's and forgive me I'm doing a lot of lecturing on parliamentary procedure lately not speak I mean like traveling and speaking and educating the way you folks operate as a body you move to discuss something in the first place which is perfectly valid within reference rules and a way to do things so you place it on the proverbial table for discussion this kind of came up with a transition here when you guys would say motion so you said we're riding at this issue motion second and what you're saying is we agree that we still want to take this up because it has happened in my tenure here where you get to an item and the dies for lack of emotion saying which is functional in the body's saying we don't even want to talk about this much less decide on a proposed solution so what you've done is the original motion was we want to talk about and then you said okay now that we're talking about it I've come up with a proposed procedure that I think works and the member baker said yeah me too so I'm going to move to just use this method and so it went from a discussion to a closed solution and so that the motion on the floor as it stands now is to endorse the solution you brought forward all right so we had a motion to approve the method made by Frank Banker if we have a second any approach all right we've got a plan here and we will uh we'll take care of this on the 20 20 meeting that will be a special city council meeting um is the last Monday before our regular council meeting will that be the first day that we receive the names and the resumes or we did that ahead of time yes that agenda packet with all the names and applications will go out to you on Wednesday okay this Wednesday thank you for doing as we're working around Patty's vacation thank you thank you so much I really do appreciate that all right I'm 16. I'm finished business we're unsuccessful in having a work session this month we're going to make it for the last month we're going to make it afford this month there's a special meetings and more sessions but we'll get caught back up I don't really think we're that far behind I think we're doing pretty well and [Music] meetings can can you just probably tell us because generally it's all on the last page okay so next Monday is our work session and then we won't have another one until the 28th which is a special council meeting whenever we elect uh Glen Gunter replacement yes all right I'm 17. Council Commons I had so much fun letting the computer generate a random order last month I did it again so uh this month we start off with council member Roberts you have before all right so just um kind of a humorous comment here that again going back to the infamous Saturday night by the Halloween one of one of the deputies who was to me looked like he was over there's too many people there in the parking lot on 19th Street and of course many of the youngsters these days don't seem to have been I'm sorry to say have they been raised properly and so one guy came up to the police officer and said uh hey I'm going on the beach and the deputies said nobody's going on the beach we're shutting this down party's over to go home at which point the young man said hey I know my rights I'd go on the beach and I was going to walk past you and I wanted that he said um say that again at which point the young man thought otherwise and turned around with his friend and they laughed so again I just want to praise the deputies that were out there that night I'm not sure how I would responded it was just overwhelming you see I don't know how many people but it seemed like three or four hundred people just walking around there completely out of control and it was within 30 minutes they were all gone so again great job thank you Mr Roberts all right let's move to uh council member Banker um just briefly I'm able to see a coordinates 2204 about employees uh we're keeping the buoys I think it's a safety item a year ago this Capital voted six to one to put a few buoys in the Bel Air Shores approved for my first First Street to 17th or the 2017 Street Belarus Georgia I'm wondering if this Council would do that now because I went over to talk about our Shores and the mayor there was very gracious about our offer but he wanted to wait and collect the election the election election over since March in order of Wisconsin would be willing to do the same if they were I'm going to respond to that because I think that I may have picked up one I may have gotten a different message and I remember whatever you presented it and I think that they were more worried about maintenance he says once there's a good lead out there it's no longer it's no longer our we're not paying for it they will be paid for it and so this Council would have to I believe to get into agreeing that if they would even do it at all would be to agree to assume it's never been removed and we will always be sitting at the store maintain and replace it and I just think that the people from First Street to 20th Street deserve the same protection between Street View Apartments I think there's another something else to consider on that also they would have to go through the same permitting process that we'll have to yes sir there is a point of order we shouldn't be discussing the history and Council comments that officially reserved as a manual for a working session I'm good for that you okay that's my comments I'm a child of my cops would you like to make any more thanks to all the Veterans for Veterans Day I remember the one Senator saying about staying for the national anthem and come over to Arlington cemeterial Street 400 000 reasons that I should stand thank you mrzabel ah okay um on that topic I just want to go out there about Chief happy Veterans Day people kind of tend to forgive that there's Memorial Day and as for our fall and Veterans Day for all this guy at above ground I also want to point out he recently uh was elected to a national office from the naval Reserve Association so I'm asking you congratulations [Applause] that's all I have thank you blessing material vice mayor Shirley just once again thank everyone for attending the meetings we really appreciate the participation and definitely appreciate what our citizens are doing rallying together and stepping up to serve on boards and assisting cows on the city staff thank you thank you I'd like to remind everyone our next work session is on Monday November 14th I also like to remind everyone that a park and rec board is hosting a chili cook-off on Saturday November the 19th between noon and 2 P.M I wasn't kidding whenever I said I would bring my chili however I will only be there to as an exhibit not as a competitor but I will be serving too in that day so just checking if you as an exhibit yeah let's see here November 28th we will have a special council meeting to elect the council member to replace a lien gun if you haven't applied and want to you need to do it by Wednesday is that correct Patty yes the ninth and uh also we're expecting another storm I'd be lucky in but still uh they're predicting possible 50 mile per hour guys so you've got anything loose in your yard you might want to tie it down or bring it inside I'd like to thank everyone for joining us tonight and do our Evolution to adjourner promotional yes just one more thank you for the parks and rec committee I don't know how many people here had a chance to attend but they put on the Halloween costume for the youngsters and and the dogs as well but they did a great job and the judges were extremely intelligent had a lot of wisdom as a result of uh we're wanting to first prize with my granddaughter so it was a great time thanks thanks for the community [Applause] donated to Pinellas County shelter and the first prize you have to name back in Dallas County Charlotte we were very thankful if anybody needs a dog we're up to about 50 right now thank you do I have a motion to adjourn motion which made by Frank Baker do I have a second all in favor I am your opposed I didn't think so all right good night everyone"
