one I can do the next one yeah yeah review of the graphs of the ordinance the city code chapter 86 regarding C sign regulations that's the purpose in this meeting I read this and kept going back and forth I am open for discussion right now if there's any objections as we continue with the situation I was going to ask if we could get a little background on it why you know what what's driving the changes who made the changes and and just for clarification specifically as we get back into the backs would it districts RL and RM what's the difference between these two okay a lot lots of bite off there so I'm going to take your questions in succession thank you member Hart um Randy Morris City attorney uh I think it's important to have a little bit of a chronology of events here and then we can talk about the case law and the product before you um I've been your City attorney almost exactly a year now I was retained around late May early June of last year when I interviewed for the for this position one of the principal inquiries that I received from all of the council members are many of the council members was about the city sign code and if I could help change adopt modernize the sign code after we worked through the transition of the city manager position and other shorter term priorities last summer in the fall the question came where are we on the sign code so my office prepared an ordinance the ordinance a version of the ordinance you have before you the commission has seen this previously and asked that you folks weigh in on it and sort of serve as the as another set of eyes my office prepared this ordinance because back in 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion in a case called read versus town of Gilbert Arizona the summary and the quickest way possible to say it is what was going on in that case was there was a church and Pastor seeking to place temporary signs announcing services in their community and they filed suit claiming that the town sign ordinance restricting the size duration and location of these temporary directional signs violated their right of free speech and the district court that's the trial court that they were in denied the church's motion their court of appeals that was in the ninth circuit so out towards California way um affirmed in part and remanded important on remand the town won again and the church and Pastor appealed and it got to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court felt that the sign code was subject to strict scrutiny which is the highest level of of analysis when you give First Amendment Free Speech regulation and they found that the sign code violated free speech guarantees and that was because the sign code had different restrictions for if it's a religious organization doing this political signs were regulated a certain way which most communities had their sign codes that way that was the generally agreed upon and understood Norm if we we're going to regulate political signs different than the Bellaire Beach 5K signs and whatever else and the court said no no no no because what you're doing is you're making content-based regulations and you can't do that you keep from non-commercial speech for commercial speech you can do some of that it's a lower level of scrutiny it's intermediate which is still elevated but not as high as strict scrutiny so the opinion comes out and cities across the country and and by the way that opinion is not a nine zero or even a five four those of you who have ever read Supreme Court opinions you can have a concurring opinion which says I reached the same conclusion but for different reasons there's three concurrences there's no clear majority so it leads to confusion and division on what is the path forward is it the majority opinion with the concurrences and and there's been a flavor of that that's played out since immediately after 2015 some communities sought to very promptly adapt we're gonna okay we're reading the opinion we're gonna navigate it and the way a lot of communities did that was they hired Consultants who they did not knock their City attorneys but other Consultants or legal cons there was one firm in the city in the State of Florida that was principally doing this the attorney at that firm has since um contracted health issues and other issues that sort of taken them out of the freight and after that a lot of communities said well enough people have done it that were comfortable doing versions of whatever that is um I want to read to you not chapter and verse a little bit of a law review article that came out after this that sort of explains this um this landscape a little better in the aftermath of read it is all the more important for municipal governments to periodically address their sign codes compliance with the first amendment in doing so many lawyers and planners look for existing laws they can copy or cling to as an example of what is defensible this is a natural response considering the complexity of the law and Financial Risk of litigation which increased after read nevertheless the proprietary the propriety and defensibility of side regulations vary drastically based on the nature vary the Ary drastically based on the nature of the jurisdiction and its policy goals a regulation that is perfect for one setting could be very damaging and lead to successful challenges in another unfortunately there's no one-size-fits all for sign regulations and such an approach would leave a lot on the table in terms of achieving important governmental objectives however there's some general guidelines and they walk through some guidelines like avoid unnecessary content-based regulations avoid unnecessary exceptions like unless you're the Catholic church or something like that avoid a regulation regulation of commercial advertis advertising is still subject to intermediate scrutiny have a substitution Clause regulation or prohibition of off-premises billboard signs is permissible and and it goes on this is a law review article from the Stetson law review um I want to see when it was published in 2020. so five years out there's since been some more case law that's kind of clarified a little bit of the concurrences but suffice to say what you have before you is a response to top-down interpretation and regulation we are responding to what the Supreme Court has said and that's what's prompting the impetus behind what you have before you consequently in a landscape where it varies Community by community and things can be challenged you have like 15 pages of Warehouse clauses I have never once submitted anything else to this community that looks like that but that's not how I operate however comma if we are trying to put forward something that says we know that this is sort of an amorphous um Rorschach legal test so what do you see is this okay we knew the landscape when we went in we've given our hat tip and head nod to it and so we believe what we are doing here aligns with all of this I am I don't expect all of you to understand everywhere as Clause if you wish for those to be curtailed they can be curtailed understand that's why they're there is to add Credence to if we have to defend it it cannot be said that they ignored the authority we we have we have cited the authority and it was updated for your purposes separately the length of the ordinance itself you presently have a signed code that is like four pages and this is like 24 pages or something like that when you get to the actual ordinance itself again I know when I was hired and I was retained I was asked to provide us a new sign code well what would you like us to do in this new Seinfeld make it legal I've told you the legal landscape is make it defensive make it defensible make it defensible is a better term make it defensible without any specific guidance as to and this is our core concern in this community or this is an ill we have had in the past that we wish to see cure so what I've done is what I would say to to use an analogy you have before you a Cadillac it's got every Bell and whistle some you may never use if you want a Honda Civic and I love a Civic I drove a second um if you want acidic tell me if you say this is we want this is too much our little Beach Community doesn't need all of this then just tell me what you wish to excise and as long as that doesn't go against what we can and can't do then we will excise it or change it appropriately um I flagged in the draft there are various places where you have highlighted yellows that's to show you where your discretion is highest if you want to make something 10 square feet instead of 12 pool this doesn't the case law on that doesn't go in too much into as long as you're not getting to the point that you're making it impossible 5 centimeters what's the Catch-22 on it being as thorough or as comprehensive as it is I think the Catch-22 is precisely the moment we had when each of you walked in and and kind of lifted your eyebrows and looked at each other and without saying anything sort of thing like what is this this is a lot is it is it as intuitive to your average member of the public and are they going to contend that this is written so dense that it is meant to not be understood um so that we could so if there is a catch-22 to be had that is it um well I I would be I just want to finish this one point I'm sorry I don't mean to speak over you I remember heart but this as I told you the commission has has seen this and has given some guidance on a version of this one of your Commissioners was very vocal that they felt that the actual opinion given was that I wrote something that would be legally challenged so I could make money on the back end when the challenge happens I submit to you I am not for want of work and I don't need to Gin it up um but beyond that they also made the point that they feel they've read the read opinion and they feel that this is not suitable in light of read it's too much in their in their estimation and what they described as a clear decision from the Supreme Court I would say give them a concurrences it's not a clear decision and the case law since has kind of borne that out but all of that to say one of your Commissioners has expressed like this why can't we have two pages or four pages make it clean Chris this is what you can do this is what you can't do if I was going to telling people who are not trained lawyers what should I be looking at in this the highlighted portions are one place if you're wishing to just kind of stick with it another is there is one section of it that is specifically entitled prohibited signs are there signs that we are prohibiting that you're like no in Bella Beach I want that kind of sign I want a sandwich board sign or whatever the thing is then just tell me I want to be very clear I am not a policy maker in your community I don't wish to be a policy maker in your community you folks are the Clearinghouse for things that will get to the commission and be policy if there's anything in this you want changed it does not hurt my feelings let's talk about it let's do it so it reflects what this community wishes to do with its home rule Powers but what I've given you is here's everything tell me what you want what you don't want what works what doesn't work and we will adapt it appropriately to this community so that's sort of my little elevator speech and not so elevator maybe Subway ride um speech on how we got here uh I'm happy to answer any questions specifically the big thrust of read is that non-commercial speech can only be regulated in a Content neutral way so a the the the general notion that we're going to regulate you know a political sign can be 10 feet big and a um a sign for the Boy Scouts popcorn sale can be four we can't do that the other one is the way that this has worked is we're generally regulating them with the exception of one provision that mirrors state law um and it's only in there because of air state law generally speaking the number of signs temporary signs for example are uniform and so if you say a private property can only have five temporary assignments in an election season that would mean you got your president your Senate and maybe three commission two Commissioners in a ballot measure and the person next door can have just go to war God is love I love the beach save the manatees they get five we're not worried about oh well it's an election they get more no it's five temporary signs and that's really like that's really the Crux of what this tries to ameliorate in a code your code had not been Revisited in a very long time certainly not since read and it's progeny so this seeks to ameliorate that put your Roar definition that's what I felt when I looked at some of these things it's a matter of interpretation Etc you're doing I think what we better do is start with each person if they have a per we'll start with heart first no I hope not this highlight well I wanted to know what was the diff What just for clarity the difference between an RL district and an RM history yeah so that's that is uniform regardless of this code right that's your you guys have residential medium and residential low so it'll have to do with them it's just your zoning code districts it's not creating something new that's how all of your zoning works in the city where where are L M's so the RM is going to be from where the jurisdictional line on the west side of Gulf Boulevard which is 19th Street beach access is one house that's Beller Shore and then goes into a condominium multi-family use of that from there all the way up to I think it's 3 500 across from the marina is the RM okay District Two and then the RL district one is the um everything else pretty much all the side streets and private screens the absence of all the you've got a lot of detail does the absence of this detail means one council person felt that this opened up for a lot of lawsuit because somebody's going to challenge it but if it's not there then you have to debate every issue that comes up as well don't you that was my contention yes sir this is another way of looking at it outside of the car analogy is this is the insurance policy this is the just in case it ever comes up it's been addressed if somebody decides to install a neon sign well we don't have any neon signs of Melody so we don't need to regulate neon signs we've never had that issue but we've seen the marketplace start doing things that it never did before homes didn't used to be hotels so you you anticipate the you see the issues other communities have had I was speaking with our newest member earlier before the meeting started and explaining in addition to serving as a City attorney I also have the privilege of serving serving as panel counsel for insurance defense for other cities I can't tell you I've had a lot of sign code litigation but to the extent I'm aware of the litigation landscape it informs my policy it creates more robust policy because you're like well I've seen how this goes sideways so let's just anticipate it and not have that problem it it's different issue but I said to Kyle last week one of the things we might want to look at is is what's becoming more and more popular is the rental of amenities swimming pools swimming yeah I'm familiar with the platforms and yes and while we have a restriction on Airbnb there's nothing in there about amenities So and I've provided that guidance and that's you know yes absolutely so the more we we address up front at least the more we're declaring in advance to someone here's what you need to know if you want to put something on and and in a current political landscape in Florida where the legislature has expressed no qualms about preempting local regulation the sooner you become proactive rather than reactive the more likely you are to be you know grandfathered or you know hey you did the Indiana Jones yeah the Airbnb is a perfect example if after June 2011 if you didn't read the tea leaves before June 2011 two bats even if it didn't come to your community until five years later it's too late how much of what we're doing in here is driven by all the conflict I I don't know a lot about it but I know there was a lot of conflict about the sign out here the the uh or at least I have heard there was a lot of conflict about the new sign for the city hall here zero of what I have done has been driven by any controversy in your community I drafted this based on not a uniform template this was customized to your community in your zoning districts I leave it to you folks to tell me hey this hasn't factored in you know when I did the version of this in Indian Rocks Beach and they haven't adopted theirs either they said hey we've got the big sign for Crabby Bills how do we work that into this okay early on events on page 10 whereas the city finds anything inside the road which distracts the driver there's also an exception for city issued science okay the city but that's ordinary is that or because could somebody claim well how come the city gets to do this but nobody else can do it because the city is different than everybody else inherently we're not private citizens we're government and we have obligations to provide advisories that a private citizen doesn't have to tell people about hurricane routes and advisories in every manner of other things so we have the permission to regulate differently so the businesses the the business of outdoor advertising should be prohibited but we use this song I'm not being critical of them just bringing up no you're trying to understand you're conceptualizing we advertise yoga we advertise weddings is that in conflict with any of this because the yoga becomes a commercial application doesn't it well I'm not sure specifically how the yoga operates here and and where that commercial line just I'm not trying to be melee math I don't know about how the yoga space is used and how you know I'm looking at this are we in conflict with some of the things with what we're proposing are we in conflict with things we're already doing I don't think so personally um because if you look at for instance the yo you're you're making it known this room is reserved for this time for this event um so if you are hoping to make use of this room during that time please know it's already been reserved and plenty of communities have that's a pretty consistent thing we're not advertising come join yoga Bella Beach yoga we're saying this is an event that is scheduled Tucker um area of sine page 13 double sign shall be construed to the perimeter both faces coincide your parallel not more than 24 inches apart how does a double face sign end up 24 inches apart the depth of the sine is two feet if that's if I'm looking at them I'm not getting to where you're looking so that's like the last paragraph thickness of like a monument sign you got it marked oh I see it's it's how wide okay yeah okay but again that's a highlighted portion if you folks think that two feet is too much make it one foot whatever you want to do I I'm here for your input I had a personal one and it has to do with signs on scene walls it says each property shall be allowed one sign I've got four on mine don't tell nobody well that's not out here it's that's something that kind of loads the property it's the reality of it is if I don't put them there I've got boats and everybody else pulling up thinking it's public property so how do we account for that because there are other pieces of property like that in Bel Air great question uh I I I mean genuinely again that's something that's very particular to your community and that's the kind of feedback I'm looking for is saying hey can you take a look at this we could absolutely take a look at it when I'm drafting as a as a lawyer I'm not looking at like the Mr Hart's neighbor I don't know your sea walls that well I don't know every every nook and cranny of your community like you do and that's why I value your folks input in the policy making process and and specifically we are not prohibiting the use of private property no trespassing I didn't see that anyway there was a preclusion in here this does not prohibit as I recall a second I'm switching through several tabs online so the um warning sign or safety signs and inside is it page 29 yeah yeah under under applicability 86-5 signs posted as no trespassing and the manner provided for in Florida Statutes and RX this chapter is not regulated by this yes I have a constant problem people getting on them that was 86-5 now I believe that's like around each of the document [Applause] s yeah so he could have multiple on a sea wall as long as if they're all no trespassing signs and they're not covered by that right if it's private property no trespassing and he's just got him spaced out those signs are not regulated by this but if you have five signs and one of them says go Red Sox you know down with the Rays I love the water then yeah then we're getting closer to five signs you know to a number of signs on flags we specifically regulate flag poles for about flags on houses and I'm not trying to create problems my smile was because quite honestly um when this was before the commission yeah candidly the most time was spent discussing flags flag sizes number of flags height of the pole size of the flag so that was where to the extent the commission substantively made suggestions it mostly had to do with the flag Provisions um and so my son was like that's funny that you guys are honing in on that particular element as well that's all my smiles remind me who the commission is uh the legislative body of seven members so the mayor um sorry I I forgot where I was Council I just didn't know if that was a county thing no no no that's just the council my apologies continue Mr um I'm still with a favor don't start none there won't be none yeah so Flags mounted to houses what I want to make sure I understand your question there there was a great controversy to the south of us if somebody would like draped a flag over their roof the size of you know something that you would fly on a military base for everybody to See For Miles um are you talking about a mounted flag or a flag that's just like let's say you've got a flagpole and you put up a an American flag and you put a military flag and then you've got a flag hanging off your house it says the best college team there is go Gators you know everybody makes mistakes sure yeah my point is are we gonna I think it's kind of where you're coming from are we going to start really nitpicking if somebody throws up a sign for the weekend that's that's promoting their college team or their high school team or whatever if they've already got a couple team couple Flags out there are they going to get cited for that I don't think that's the purpose of this is it I don't think it's the purpose of this said differently though I am always very very strongly against the idea of passing ordinances or statutes that are intended to send a message but we're never going to enforce them right that's not what policy making should be right and so if we say you know what I don't care if somebody has every inch of the exterior of their home covered in flags and I can't see the windows that's their right that's their private property if that's the culture of this community so be it tell me um but I can tell you I very likely if you live next door to that house there's somebody in your community who's going to say that I can't believe I have to look at this thing yeah we're not an HOA I'm not trying to increase you know that things pretty enough but there have if there's if there are lines to be drawn let's draw that's mindful um I'm not invested in whether it's two flags or Five Flags that's for you folks should decide thanks shark very good job let's go to the new member all right thank you please introduce yourself to the new group thank you I'm Kim Shaw Elliott I live at 121 9th Street just around the corner here and glad to be with you all thank you Kim Welcome well I thank you very much City attorney for that introduction because you hit on all the points that I wanted to talk about so I don't want to be the new person that shows up and starts asking or drilling at things where people have worked really hard at coming up with a solution so I'm glad that those issues have already been noted so if I could ask a little bit more depth one is I appreciate the fact that your first assignment was to come up with a difficult ordinance relating to signs but I am wondering if there was something more than that and I'm sure you're aware by this this community has been rather legal oriented shall we say and there's been lots of controversy around that and a lot of constitutional issues raised where seemingly may have been hypersensitive about those constitutional issues and so is that was there something else is there something else that people are trying to address by coming up with this ordinance and the level of detail regarding the Constitutional issues short answer is I I think that question can be bifurcated the length and depth of this was not driven by some explicit or implicit mandate my draft was done in the vacuum of trying to balance the nuances of the law were their motivations by individual council members when they asked me or expressed that a sign code was a priority in in the form of ordinance changes potentially if there was it was not communicated to me directly as this is the ill we need to address or this is the problem that was lingering two and three years ago that we're trying to put to bed that very well may exist I've not been that's not been communicated to me I would defer to Patty and Kyle who have and I'm not trying to put either of you on the spot but who whose tenure here precedes my own just if there's additional context I'm not aware of I think that the main controversy was from former members of councils saying that the current sign ordinance was unconstitutional and it was mainly by the regulation of what specific signs and what language which you know he said through the court cases you can't regulate what the message is and I think that was the main reason that it got looked at and can you give some historical Clarity you're probably a temporary lawyer temporary signs um I think it was more like telling people like how we regulated political science versus other signs and all that um screwed up let's you know we could talk about that forever but that came up at every situation during election time and that what we got beat to death in this community finally that's over as far as so it's over from a personality standpoint potentially and and I'm not that's not a judgment it's just saying one person was particular it's my understanding one person was particularly vocal and attuned to that I will tell you you have not changed your code so in as much as one person has expressed that that doesn't stop somebody else from expressing that same sentiment and so in every Community where that has where Reed has not been addressed your election season will you will you will be lulled into feeling it's over we haven't heard anything about it and then two election Cycles go by and somebody puts 20 signs lining the road on the front of their house so that's that's obviously to many they can't do that well they can only have five political signs and then they come to a City attorney and I say we can't regulate yes our code says five political signs I would not enforce that provision because of read because that is a number based on the content and so communities who have not and there are many in Florida who have not yet changed our code you're not alone in this some Kick the Can because they get these drafts or they don't know how to reconcile them but every time election season is when you feel the same again absolutely and not every election season which almost makes it worse women would adoption of this prevent or hand or eliminate a reoccurrence of whatever the problems were before without specific knowledge of the problems before beyond that expressed concern it'll quell it um I travel the state and educate on operation of government and ethics and open government and my three takeaways regardless of the topic I'm presenting on is don't screw up you're human you're going to screw up and don't hide it and the third one is just because someone says you screwed up doesn't mean you screwed up and and I will say that adopting this ordinance will not prevent somebody from accusing the community of getting it wrong either in the form of this ordinance or you didn't address it enough so I can't stop controversy but it would quell the legal concern it would directly address the legal concern raised or a barrel of attorneys could come in and change challenge it and that's something we can't say oh no we're going to happen for any reason it's not we're right something there and says that's not legal that's not going to that situation my second question related to the format and you've already noted that that you've never done one in this particular way um so why 12 pages of whereas is and why was this not done perhaps as a separate brief that would be submitted to the city and in what format would this ultimately take and I'm giving you a compound question I realized and now I'm taking it down but um for instance is this sort of like a preamble but that that then is not part of the actual ordinance that's seen when people cite to the ordinance or the whereas Clauses do not get codified okay um the whereas Clauses do not get codified it is in function and operation in fact a preamble it is a preamble that is also I'm trying to get to my window here where I had this pulled up it is a preamble that is also accompanied by the fact that it says all the recitations above are considered Incorporated here and you don't you don't when you when we post this to the Unicode which is the platform by which we publish our ordinances they don't see those first 12 pages okay that is functionally a legal memo of sorts and and again the reason it's in there is if and when we do receive should we receive some kind of legal challenge it signals to the court when they say oh we believe that the city failed to con to consider no we didn't there it is um if you folks or the commission say we don't want all this in there make that I want one page of whereas is Randy I'll make it happen I'll make it happen this was again drafted saying this is the most robust way I can make this look because it's easier to subtract than to add in practice in format every ordinance I give you has whereas classes there might be three there might be three pages there might be 30 pages every ordinance has somewhere else causes that format is the case it's just the the level of detail and I will admit to you I could write this with less and there's some the law is nothing redundant there are some redundancies in there I can streamline that for sure for sure for sure writing a legal memo helps but the difference between this being a memo that I write to you versus whereas cause that is incorporated as part of the findings signals to the court the legislative body the council had these looked at them and felt yes based on this background and the council I've received on it I'm comfortable movement codified it doesn't the whereas Clauses do not get caught up it's just a guideline uh correct they are this is what the this is the historical record of all the factors that were considered before adopting us part of the history the legislative history so people have an understanding of what was considered as well as what their thoughts were in enacting well stated and to take it out of this and after whenever we get to the end of this topic there's a second issue that Kyle intends to Broach about uh regulation of pools and pools pool Heights and when that issue came up the first question Kyle and I drafted is or asked ourselves was how did they get here let's look at the ordinance where they said it was 18 inches or 20 inches or whatever the number is and we look at what are the what are the minutes and what are the whereas Clauses say does it say like whereas we just lost this lawsuit and we're doing it or does it say whereas we find it needs to be changed without any detail should something like this be adopted somebody goes back there's going to be no mystery as to how we got here yeah thank you very much and the last issue also raised thank you thank you it's the length and with that I go to the question of readability and enforceability so that to me an ordinance is something that the general populace should be able to read and understand what's prohibited and what's allowed without getting a legal opinion now there are always exceptions to that but also if somebody comes and says hey I want to put a sign out my in my yard and they ask for your help I want to fill out an application do I have it right you know you're going to be in a position of saying I have no idea I'm not going to give you legal advice you know whereas it seems that we should have something that people can understand and unders and know how to comply with so for that I have concerns about this because I myself have trouble reading it as an alternative I just decided to well let's just pull up Indian Rock speech they're right next door we're not at all like them in the sense that they have significant commercial activity where almost all residential but okay they're next door they're a Beach Community they have to deal with issues what does theirs look like and it's a very readable statute and it's it's 12 pages and I'm their City attorney and they've had a draft before them for three years but they've been principally focused on short-term rental regulation yeah and they are looking to modify their code in order not too dissimilar from yours their code has not been updated since read uh um so you're looking at a code that requires adaptation other communities that have adopted something more recently city of Dunedin city of Tarpon Springs full disclosure we represented both those communities at the time they were adopted I don't we don't represent either they're presently um if you search the state for post read you'd want to look for something that's been adopted since let's say 2016 onward um and you can when you're on Unicode you can see it shows like that last year so if you're looking at samples from other communities to inform a future product that would be my suggestion but I do want to inform in as much as you're looking at look what IRB has IRB is looking to change their sign code but if we look we look at just in terms it's it is very readable and it's and it's laid out in a in an easy to read structure that would go straight to oh what kind of sign am I thinking about oh there's a section right on it it tells us what's prohibited and what's not it tells us sign limitation excuse me side size limitations so just in terms of format I just found this yeah okay and that's valid feedback I appreciate that I know okay an incredible amount of work went into this so I'm sure everybody's very appreciative of that I don't know whether they are or not it's less important to me whether they appreciate it and more important to me that it aligns with what you want as a community so yeah that's it for now okay let's go welcome back she had a little situation where her husband was a bit black now he's back and she's happy and yes it's your turn okay so I just had some questions uh on page six uh what is a Paul sign I I don't know what a full sign was I thought maybe it was a billboard but is a permanent ground sign that is supported by one or more polls more than four feet in height and otherwise separated from the ground by air so if there's a sign on a pole that's at least four feet high foreign okay that's a big one I don't have I'm gonna get one now [Music] the picture or the pull sign so on page seven let's get you referenced uh the dangers of unsafe signs [Applause] in the warehouse Clauses yes sir what what would you consider an unsafe sign one that's Fallen apart or structurally unstable or some other means I guess if there was or too far into the right of way I mean there's a lot of pen material that was toxic I mean there is a definition oh I should have read page 20 too and for the purposes of the record if you're pointing to page 22 an unsafe sign means a sign posing an immediate Peril a reasonably foreseeable threat of injury or damage to persons or property which could be any of the things that were just stated okay it leaves it up to interpretation of the inspector yeah I will tell you the legend or key to reading this starts with the definition section the definition section is very robust to to avoid too much of I'm not sure if this is that your second most important section then is the prohibited signs section and it has a list of signs all of which are defined in the definition section um and I would say that where for your average person that is where the most heavy lifting is done in this ordinance defining signs and saying what we don't allow is really where most of the work is done in an ordinance like this I was going to suggest under definitions if we could include the RL and RM just so people can reference that because I look back and forth and I didn't I know we've gone through some of the zoning stuff that just didn't know what it was reference okay continue yeah I'm just looking to see if temporaries on here yeah definitions yes and most definitely is because that's that's where the um yes the biggest part of this work is is the electronic version do hyperlinks back to definitions uh no it's not hyperlinked across it does lend itself to a control F search Okay um uh but as far as as far as linking to no it's not fully cross reference let's go back to your comment the the definitions of the zonings that'll be this will be incorporated into the entire code so it'll be easy to be there yeah it is otherwise in the social we can make a I can make a hat to it to make it a little easier within the ordinance and the other question I had was about the RL and the RM so we got that answer it's covered very good are there any other observations from this committee before I get started one question I had is an obscure I could have been on that um on the bottom of page 34 uh when it talks about rights of appeal I thought this was kind of interesting because it said that if you make an appeal and the board doesn't get around to the meeting then your appeal is considered automatically denied how does that support through process great question um it is it supports the process in terms of a then they have a subsequent appellate right and the record below would reflect that there was not a substantive analysis done we would not just sit on something before we'd make an effort and there is provision I believe there is provision in there for um in our Board of adjustment section it says that the Magistrate will rule on it right and it would be subsequently they'd have seconds um they have the the there would be noticed there would be the opportunity to be heard as the uh is the application submission itself um I think would be the contention but I would be happy to look at that and see if that comports with other if there are other analogous code provisions on the due process right I think that's a good question because it and just from a practical standpoint from the citizens perspective one there's always an argument that you didn't get around to it because you wanted to you wanted to be mean to me you know you some medicine I wanted to you know and everybody else gets theirs heard within 30 days and well why didn't you bother getting together when my application came along but the other thing is a matter of cost obviously it's a much different matter to appeal to a local board as opposed to having to present at court law and so it's significant cost difference that way so maybe it should be the other way around that if it's if if the board doesn't meet within that amount of time maybe it's automatically approved I mean something to just motivate people to ask no I will I will look at that and I am part of a law firm I will ask my colleagues one if they um what their thoughts are on that and two it might be cleaner to just make it a right of appeal to the first district not the first district but the the local Circuit Court I think you'd want a more explicit local finding than one of them what an administrative holding is before you get there the court has to deal with a record from A administrative level um but we I can definitely look at the due process concern there I think it's well stated why not wouldn't have to do with just this I agree with you if the council didn't want to address it or didn't want to pass it they could just it's a pocket veto yeah could ignore can't language be in this just do it on the first round first meeting whatever that subsequent meeting is you have to address it in the following meeting and and give the citizens that the benefit of forcing counsel to make a decision but yes yeah so they're not being forced to have to take it to a higher authority and that's what the council's here for I mean that's a good point yeah again the feedback's well taken and I can definitely look to that and revisit that in the subsequent draft why do we hold our Council candidates to 72 hours to remove signs which I think they did a great job after this last election yet we give every other politician 30 days and some of them are still out there nearly a year later so you're talking about the timing for the removal yeah we think on page 39 the usage and removal yeah that come that is when I when I said earlier about um state statute uh generally uh that was pulled from seats in fact the citation is within there um I would not mess with those days and numbers because that is a that is a link that is language they are yellow they are yellow and and on on later review I realized I would got a little every time I saw dates and things I was flagging them so we're going to hold the council members responsible or candidates or local candidates to removing those signs quickly but there's nothing we can do about the any other level of power political hold on I'm pulling it says each candidate whether federal state county or district office shall make a good faith effort to remove all of his or her political campaign advertisements within 30 days the 30 days comes from the ordinance from from the state statute the city office 72 hours is a local regulation and your commission talked about that particular language so the 30 days is I wouldn't make it more than that that state status the 72 hours your commission your Council sorry forgive me your Council talked about exactly that regulation they're like yeah I mean insert State politician Anna Paulina Luna doesn't live in Beller Beach Baler Beach is like less than two miles square if you live here and you're running here you should be able to get up and down every street within three days and take care of your business with sort of this sentiment not those words um and so the shorter timeline was actually welcomed by the council members saying and and being held to that more stringent standard because their sentiment was as a candidate who lives here and is serving this community you would continue to be serving your community to beautify it within three days the reality of it is any of the other candidate signs were put up by local residents anyway potential get permission from the from the property owner to put it up potentially generally speaking yes and there's still some of these up and you wonder what's the point of having them up right no I'm just saying 30 day what if you're going to hold the council the 72 hours find out everybody else but you can't you can't that's the state section yeah the 30 the 30 days comes from the state of statue and what's the hammer if you don't remove it it's a violation of of 106. 1435 the statute citation from from RN yes while we're at that section uh in B2 um it's the time begins after having been eliminated as a candidate I assume that means they've withdrawn but does that also include you weren't elected correct okay um if you lose a primary for example um and that is also um that is also the language that one a b and c um of 106 145 1435 it says the actual statute says each candidate whether for a federal state county or district office shall make a good faith effort to remove all of his or her political campaign advertisements within 30 days after a withdrawal of his or her candidacy B having been eliminated as a candidate or C being elected to office very good all right thank you and then it continues however a candidate but that is um that language is a mirror of the statue okay everybody if everybody finish wait for you okay I too went through this and as anything else goes I know that it wasn't codified these are all guidelines Etc and when they hand you something like this and say take a look at that it's kind of overwhelming to a lot of people and you see what this exists well my background has been in this field so I know that it's still up to them Council when the attorneys and the judges when everything comes down to the fair facts and these guidelines are here for a purpose so we don't get overrun I've been in this city forever since 1989 and it's been pretty good all the way through a lot of fine people and a lot of fine people on this board I served on the board for petting it alone since I was a citizen since I since I moved in but I appreciate this group the zoning board has always had five members I'm glad to joined Kim and Patty would always say that we're the only board she ever had in a city that's always got five members and that's cut that's kind of a compliment to us we've seen attorneys go we've seen city managers go we've seen Mayors go but we're still here and we do the best we can with what we got and Randy had presented something that it ain't easy but it simplifies something that tries to touch every base and we all know it doesn't touch every base because there's they're invented all the time so and the city manager God bless him he's probably the the wheels are paddy and she's been very Cooperative with us keeping us informed and right now I would like to call for a motion to recommend that we have no objections to what was presented to us on the ordinance uh 20 to 23 Day show one I am open for a motion there were some points though that I think to address that I would say um you know recommend approval subject to the commentary given today otherwise given and I've been documenting that as has the clerk and of course the minutes will reflect the business of the body and so it's not we don't just throw those away and I don't do anything with them taking under advising all of your comments thus far so you can move directly yeah move to recommend approval subject to the input this board is otherwise given is I would say probably the cleanest way to do that from a parliamentary procedure are you rewarding my emotion no sir I'm advising the client on on the requested input relative to the motion oh that was under discussion that I didn't call for okay understood what what he said so any further discussion on the motion that yes um does that motion include a reformatting a reorganization of it or are we taking it in the form that it exists now too much all right then I don't support it I I would ask for it to be slightly reorganized and a little more direct because I think the average citizen and probably most of the administrators within the community would not be able to implement you'll have to put that in apartment motion was it it's my reasoning for not supporting emotion do I hear a second you'll be asking for a second motion so so okay with all deference to the chair because everybody's kind of looking at me like what's happening remember heart has made a motion to recommend approvals subject to the general commentary the chair is looking for a second to that motion that was the motion on the floor and if there's no second then you go back to discussion correct correct we could include Kim's points on this it is a complex document and the issue is if we continue to work at it doesn't mean people are going to read it anymore they may or may not but maybe we do have an obligation to make sure that it's it's easily the people are going to refer to it to find out what do I have to do here and you don't want to have to hire an attorney to get an interpretation on it should be pretty clear to the majority point of order kiss we have a motion on the floor until I hear a second to hearts motion I'm not sure what your mind I'll withdraw the motion because I think it needs to be restated okay so it means the motion too if there was no second in the motion wasn't carried forward okay wait a minute or make as a matter of order I'm looking for a motion to from this committee in Reef to connection with the ordinance number 2023-01 that we accept what was prolongated to us through this document but I think what this the committee is saying is no we're not ready to motion to accept it based on the way it is right now I believe that's what they're saying certainly my view yeah right so I there isn't a motion to accept it unless we restate the motion okay is there a motion that would like to be presented by the board I think we can come to agreement on that based on except I don't want to put words in your mouth but what I'm hearing out of this is that we would accept this with the changes that Randy has documented clearing up some of the points and trying to reorder it in a manner that would make it a little bit easier for the average reader reader to comprehend that means putting more work on you Randy I'm sure if I work for you folks but if we if we could accomplish those objectives to include the changes we've discussed and to make it more reader friendly in order and I'd make a motion to accept based on that subject to that and I would suck at that motion would you restate the motion no you got it on tape yeah the motion was to approve the ordinance subject to their General input and to the ordinance being reformatted in a manner that is more easily understood thank you it's made by art seconded by Kim any further discussion but by frames mean that as an approval of the ordinance but we're asking it to be Rewritten is that inconsistent my understanding is what we want to do is reorder it and just try to simplify the existing terms existing I think her question is what is one proceed and her question is if I'm generally blessing this and saying Randy rework it and then I send it to the commission having not seen it again have I have I really I don't know that I approve the way Randy Reid does it it's sort of what I'm intuiting and so I would tell you subject to the manager's input this is a matter that while it is important to the commission it is more important to them that they get it done right then they get it done fast this board meets with some regularity would you would you staff how does staff level be amenable to bringing back whatever revised draft we have yes um I I was wondering if is there any recommendation on how to simplify it or I mean or is yeah and again ordinance is going to be revised but just in terms of a model for organization I thought it was fairly well done I'm sure there are others that could be good also but I thought this one required a lot of flipping back and forth a lot of a lot of disparate treatment for different types of things um which in part is intentional I understand that but if it could be Consolidated a little bit and a general format of of uh you know here's what's allowed here's what's not allowed here are the different types of signs here are the dimensions this is how we enforce and it would just seemed to have a better flow in some of these others to that point though I noticed that we Define all these different types of signs and then we also prohibit specific signs but then it really kind of comes down to the two districts the zoning districts and if you go to um like the residential medium District it it says a permanent one wall window or monument sign so to me that's specifically IT addresses three exact types of signs so in essence it's saying that everything else is prohibited and in that District you have the most flexibility because there's less you're allowed in residential lows so maybe if we reworked it some way to to prohibit everything else it just isn't zoned because I mean like this is why I have an example of some signs just in the RM District because technically that's that's a pole sign or a monopole sign it's not a monument sign and that brings up another question is how do we want to regulate like the signs that are already in place will you address that in here though I believe you said if they're not in compliance they're if I'm reading it properly they're not in compliance they're essentially grandfathered until they become [Music] you address that I believe so yeah as long as we're okay with that um the only other thing that was brought to my attention when I looked at these signs is we have a lot of the condominium signs that are actually in the right-of-way and is that something we want to grandfather in or is that something we want just kind of if it ain't broke why fix it is it creating a problem I wouldn't say so but if somebody goes to erect another sign and it's not on their actual property and we'll prohibit it why why couldn't they put it on the right of way I mean if the right-of-way is there for the access of utilities correct yes local regulatory use I mean regulatory it's an hour it's our property function Al so and so that means ordinarily you prohibit people from putting stuff in your writing effect but if they do then they're responsible for moving it they're not responsible for removing it they're they've got to figure out what do I do if it's in the way you know if it's in the way and utilities your city or whoever comes along and removes it they've got no complaint not necessarily if you're permitting it and you're saying if if you've and I see permanently permitted it to be unless your grandfather did until it has to be moved no no I'm saying like yeah that's one that's certainly one way of going out instead of going out telling everybody right now you got to move them that's in the ordinance you can't have it on the right way if it's in the ordinance already then yeah it was in the previous ordinance too it's just yeah they're they're in there it's not being changed they're their interrogation of your cook presently okay well then if they're in violation they're in violation that's right I always say it's been I read that I ran a lot of political things that that's where it went that's where it stayed hold on a second sorry uh just a matter of discussion I know this is legalese is not easy for a person that's not trained in legalese to understand the whole situation but I know that a lot of the quotes from this document came straight out of the Supreme Court and to make that simplified I don't know if legally we're allowed to do that these are just observations can we change the verbiage that's handed down to us for it to transmit these are just my observations I can I can say that my comments did not relate to the whereas is because they're not going to become part of the published ordinance and they do not relate to Provisions like the one we looked at which is really incorporating language can you be specific and feed that back to the city manager and to Randy as to what you objected um I mean it's always saying okay it's not able to be read I think in any individual that's objecting to something should Supply Randy and the city manager with what verbiage you don't that you want streamlined I guess to adequately do that I would need to study it more but I can say that my goal would be that the ordinance be more readable okay less uh well then I think it's behooves each member who objects to supply to Randy and the city manager what they object to and would like streamlined not just say streamline the whole thing or make it more readable if there's specifics let them know what the specifics are so they're not in a dark so right now we're at an MPS where the majority of the board does not want to accept what was presented today are there any other General business to before we move pursue no I I appreciate it as a matter of procedure there is a motion on the floor that has been seconded and not resolved or withdrawn been died well there was no vote called for on on the motion well I'll vote I'll call for a vote right now on the motion it was your emotion uh yeah it was the it was the question I understand what is the wording of the motion is what I was waiting for which we went through the the I understand the the mission I believe is to try to just simplify the way that this reach I am not an attorney I think you are you're an attorney you're not doctor um are you an attorney no I'm just a so certified counts I think you made a good point in that people who are not attorneys generally do not read this as well as someone who is an attorney you've probably read it and got everything out of it to understand it you probably did I think you did okay if you didn't I think what we have to do is be cognizant of that because we don't want to have to force people to go to an attorney to say how do I put up a sign but the flip side of that is we don't want it so simple that we open ourselves up to all sorts of issues and interpretation can I make a recommendation at the risk of an interrupting you Mr member Hart um because as I mentioned I'm the City attorney in Indian Rocks Beach they just went through a six and seven month Saga of a very complex ordinance adoption um this is itself a complex order of adoption ordinance adoption by a different flavor perhaps my recommendation based on what your discussion is and ultimately it's your decision is that we bring this back for a second hearing and in the interim give the members now that we've had you came to this table somewhat let's say uninformed not by your own fault but you were given as you said sort of this daunting document and said hey what do you think I mean we've had a preliminary discussion I think just like with the comp plan when you were handed this complex document and said hey what do you think maybe there's value in taking this conversation marinating or reflecting on it if you will and having this brought back as another measure at your next meeting whether that be your July or August subject to people's travel schedules and the like and in the interim I'm happy to meet with meet and talk with any of you who wish to discuss this with me ask questions and I can say hey I've met with you each individually I'm not pulling you for this is the product I'm saying what is your input I take whatever input is well taken and either present you or a new product or say here's why I couldn't present you a new product now what do you want to do with it and that gives you all more time to either reflect on it tear it up look at it and say you know what I think it would be made easier this way now that I have a Saturday sitting by the pool to just kind of look at this thing and that way we we're not losing a lot of time trying to accomplish what we're not what it seems we're not prepared to accomplish yet so perhaps it's just a move to table a recommendation to your next meeting so that and understanding that staff is comfortable with the product we put before you we stand behind it or at least I do because it's my product on Instagram um I know the cause prepared to administer it in its current form but with that in mind that would be my recommendation to you based on your discussion and the pivoting Motions it just seems we're not all at a place of comfort where the majority's will can be ascertained okay well based on that I withdraw my motion and I I withdraw the second no you can't withdraw in the ocean you have to have a vote on the motion that's on the floor right yeah all those in favor of the motion on the floor signify by saying aye you made the motion she but after discussion I'm not going to vote for it oh that's all well push the motion yeah and then women that's the second withdrawal yes motion dies I honored I'll entertain another motion emotionally table the decision to forward this until we have more time to study it and look at alternative presentation second and discuss with City attorney yeah all right then you know that would be you know whatever do I hear a second that would be a second any further discussion hearing none I'll call for a vote all those in favor aye aye opposed anything other to become the farthest board foreign yes um so as Randy previously previously mentioned um we have another ordinance that I'd like to consider recommending a change um we've had as of this year for um variants earrings come up based on one section of code and uh it's actually the code has to deal with the height of a swimming pool can be built at in the uh on the property of a residential low single-family home property and what it currently States what's up is that the height of the swimming pool Shelby no higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road and then that's really where the road the crown of the road to the elevation um and then it goes on to say any structure part of any permanently installed in-ground swimming pool or Spa should not be built 24 inches above the pool deck including raised Spas raised pool beams upper level decks and raised waterfalls auxiliary deck mounted equipment such as handrails ladders grab rails diving boards and slides should not be subject to the height limitations set forth in this section so that's the whole thing but it's really where the problem lies and we've had hearings about is people installing new pools where they've never had a pool on their property and they're finding that if they can only go a maximum of 18 inches above the elevation of the crown of the road the pools is very low because compared to the rest of the grade of the property and they're living level floors so they're not only having to build multiple steps to get to that elevation if the pool deck was at that height but um on some properties we've seen where all the grade is higher than that height it causes almost a bowl effective where all the water will drain into that any Crown the wrong reference um so if I look back at the the hearings we've had um and I I pulled up the old uh the ordinance and the minutes surrounding the ordinance and the discussion which I'm not trying to have you guys make a recommendation today but I want um the next meeting um to have it on the agenda and find out on what information you want me to provide for you to make this recommendation now I've already pulled the ordinance which was a 2014 ordinance the minute surrounding but I I also can provide the audio of that meeting specifically the discussion of that ordinance I think it gives the best background of what was being considered at the time um quickly I I gather the main complaint was that and there was a property on uh Harrison Avenue that built the pool and it was elevated significantly above the crown of the road and uh it caused like you know a deck where the neighbor was looking down into the neighboring yards that was the example given in the audio for that meeting um they originally were talking about the elevation of the pool being relative to whatever the base floor of the house was but then it eventually turned into well we should base it off the crown of the road um again I'll provide you with that audio so you can listen to the reasoning behind it but through all these variance hearings the board of adjustment has kind of said hey you know we keep getting these one after another month after month we should probably because they keep granting them we should probably adjust the code so that we don't have these these hearings um to be if somebody could build a new home don't they have to raise their their lot anyway required yeah that's right I think that's where they got the 18 inches from originally when you go to the grading section of the code is required to at least be 18 inches above there and that's going to be affected as as government continues to change flood levels sure and and so not only are people going to be raising their their property is going to be raising their sea walls and homes that were built before all that are very example I could be sitting here with a seawall like this in my my floor level is still going to be sitting down here by the time I'm meeting all the new coach how do you how do you hold somebody that's got a new lot or a new pool to a code that doesn't meet floodplain requirements and that's that's what we're running into issues um I can tell you right now from the variance hearing so the first one was a request and this is the greatest one today um 14 inches above the maximum so that would be a total of 32 inches below the crown of the road but then the other ones we've had um one with four inches so they're looking at uh 22 inches above the crown of the road and the other one was five inches so it's not extremely high over what the maximum is but I we do have one that's going to be heard in July and this is a different issue because when they pass this original or when they pass this ordinance there were multiple property they said a lot of properties in the city are going to have a problem because they're not conforming because their pool decks were significantly higher than the girl on the road unless we're going to raise our road levels eventually every house that gets knocked down and a new one put on you're not going to meet this because they're they're great and you'll be already above that we're all dead they're going to run in the issues and then like I said we're starting to get those pools that were um that were within the code when they were built but now after they're starting to get redone and now we're running into what do we do because you got houses like uh the one coming in I think is a is for about four feet above that whoa height of the road and it's existed before this ordinance what is the board of adjustment say that one's gonna be interested I haven't they haven't heard it yet but I'm curious of what they're going to say about the the I don't think we can approve anything that's in their purview that's their purview then there are hours no he's not asking for your opinion on that case on that case I'm asking for you guys to look at this ordinance and we'll present it in a future meeting um but I can gather whatever information you think is pertinent to you can represent it on the agenda you can add it to the agenda the next meeting I'd be interested knowing what the requirements are for um if a house is raised what are the current codes requiring in terms of elevation and grade and I'd like to understand what is the purpose is this is is it so that it doesn't look like an above ground pool is that the goal here it just seems like keeping pool water above draining into something else is probably a good thing but it's supposed to be elevated somehow but but I don't know well all properties are around here they're all required to to retain the lottery either on their property or drain it to the road or the sea wall then it can't go on the neighboring property so that doesn't change anything again I'm going to provide the audio because like I said it seemed like the reason for them trying to establish is the height of the pool that can be was because people were getting them very high um because I think at one time [Music] a lot of houses were being built on a lot of builds being brought in and uh so that was raising up everything so we have some examples throughout where the you have one house that's just the grade of the property is is three to four feet higher than the neighboring property we don't allow that anymore but it was out it was happening um but those properties do exist with pools that are that are at those elevations you know it's interesting I've talked to you about this we've moved in from Fort Lauderdale about three years ago and they're going through exactly all of this and and in order to meet new code the home next door to you if it gets raised they're having to build retaining walls and their property is ending up three or four feet just the grade is three or four feet higher than the house next to it and then you put a a deck on there and you're all ready you got people looking over the fence there's nothing you can do about it well the question is can you present it to the board yes is there any objections to that for the next meeting no so I'll gather the information and the rest of the code surrounding just get it to us early thank you any other thing to come any other thing I did bring it up but I don't know if it needs to go on a different agenda I don't know if it comes to the Planning and Zoning but it's this issue of amenity rentals and controlling that because there are communities now that people are renting their pools out and all of a sudden parties show up on the street there's nothing the cities can do about it and you should you may be familiar with some of that I I am acutely familiar with it one of the platforms is called swiftly while it's called swiftly and it is for renting your pool for hey you're going to be out of town why don't you let somebody have a private pool party because you have a great Beachside deck you can also it's it's the platform has expanded so that you can rent your kitchen your sound recording studio your tennis court insert element of your property here I'd have to look at I haven't looked at it specific to your regulations because some codes didn't necessarily anticipate that but it said like if you're going to rent you rent the whole property and so I can look to that code I have provided Kyle I believe some information on that in the past um and I can and I can revisit that that language was incorporated in an ordinance I did in another Community recently so I can talk with staff and at least present you with the landscape on that looks like if that's a desired of the board is it a planning themselves oh you got to look at it yes it is because would be a Land Development regulation that would come before you and ultimately go to the commission I think a lot of people just aren't aware that that's starting to get on take a look at Indian Rocks and what's coming this way is whatever else we've got this strong position on our Airbnb so we ought to be doing everything we can to to uh I think the feedback is well taken and I'm prepared to get that to sap and it sounds like I'm looking at the nodding heads that if we if if it's not already regulated that you'd like to see some kind of at least presentation if not ordinance for your to kick around and develop yeah the other thing is people renting their boats out you know they're they're bypassing Airbnb but they're renting their their boat out for an overnight stay now I think we have ordinance against live award here don't we I believe you do so that would preclude anybody from technically from from renting their boat out I think the use of the word technically there is well placed um The Challenge becomes with any kind of thing like this is is proof and evidence that they were yeah I was I was looking at the stars at night um you know and and absolutely you do and I'm not suggesting you shouldn't regulate um I just as we start getting closer excuse me to Transit and temporary uses there's a few things in Florida that complicate that um and I want to say that up front before we get into the chapter and verse of it all but home-based business rules are one of them um the Florida legislature two sessions ago preempted your ability to regulate a home-based business so if you from your home here in Bel Air Beach wish to operate a business and I'm not just talking about an accounting firm if you wish to operate I've seen it in another Community somebody made their home a temporary UPS depot during the holidays and there was no added traffic because it's just the one truck coming and loading and they load in their driveway and anybody can fit in a driveway so there's and there's restrictions around that but it complicates your ability if it's just like hey somebody's doing something commercial provided certain boxes or checked they can do that so it makes it a little more difficult the level board thing is is different but I want to make sure you know and and there's Provisions in your code on that um but we I can look at this landscape and and brief the manager and come to you with a discussion of where you are and where you may need to go yeah I think you're running the the same problem with look well how we got all these boats out here it's like all they'd have to do is drop anchor that's right anything else that really comes before the sport I'll call for an adjournment okay all those in favor sure good"
