appreciate your support and thank you all for your time thank you Miss Gattis any other citizens would anyone like to speak all right we are now closing citizen comments and so we are now on to item three uh which is a presentation for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office hi are you all by yourself tonight uh I don't know who's supposed to be here tonight but uh I can do with the code enforcement report if that would please you that will be just fine we'll we will move forward with the code enforcement report and uh we actually do have a printed copy of what was going to be discussed very good uh good evening commissioner or Commissioners mayor staff and citizen Steve Clapper for the record uh December uh was again a very busy year for code enforcement we are doing a um a lot of enforcement again on some of the local ordinances as far as the weeds and brush we're getting that pretty much taken care of um one thing that I'm very proud to say we've had an issue at the corner here at uh Causeway and Gulf Boulevard and I spoke to the homeowner and as of today they started repainting their house so they're uh I spoke on Friday and they said they were going to try to get something done in the next two weeks but I was very pleased to see that they were painting today when I showed up this afternoon other than that everything else is pretty much status quo we still have uh probably about four cases right now that I'm working on for unlicensed contractors and unpermitted stuff got two more today but again they're they're going to be in compliance so but other than that if anybody has any questions Council any questions I have a question yes ma'am on Harrison Avenue the doc repair yeah I'm sorry you can't hear you knock repair in the Derek boat I noticed there was a 15-day notice given do you know what the status of that is on Harrison Avenue uh and Harrison um what was the complaint on Harrison the do you mean the doctor yeah I'm just waiting for them to get a a permit pulled the problem with docs is it's very difficult to get those permits pulled um and I've asked him to give me a call once he gets an estimate because then he has to come through the city and then go through the county process so we just had somebody on the leader we've been working on for 14 months now and she finally getting the permits and everything in order so right but when you run the risk of um of a lift floating off it's hanging on by like one thread um and a boat that's half sunk that's those are things that need to be removed not necessarily dock repair what what is our position on that Kyle well I didn't know about the boat is the boat still there is it sunk into the water because I don't know anything about that I know our marine unit pulled it out um and it was supposed to be removed by Cito so that's the last I heard about it and that was just before Christmas yeah it's tight it's still tied up and then the lift like I said is just hanging on by one you know and when that lets go I don't know where the Love's Gonna end up but chances are it'll end up in the middle of the canal which is our channel to our Marina I'll take a look at the uh the lift condition and if it is something that's about to break loose then it will be removed before they get a permit to put something new in okay thank you any other questions or comments from the council okay thank you very much have a good evening happy New Year yeah same to you and uh I would also like to uh let you know that today is National Law Enforcement appreciation day and uh thank you just wanted you to know that we certainly appreciate you and we would appreciate the others if they were here I showed up and I will tell you that actually um it's funny you mentioned that tomorrow night I am going to the hockey game uh it's the lightning has a law enforcement Appreciation Night and uh a gentleman by the name of Mike Honeycutt who owns Jedi CU out of Tampa is taking 14 of us to the game tomorrow evening so that's where I'll be tomorrow evening well I'll probably see you there but I'll see you on the big screen have a good evening YouTube thank you if we do have a representative from the uh the sheriff's department um whenever they come in we'll just halt the meeting get a report and then we'll get right back on track if that's okay with the council that's great great all right now we are on to item four which is a presentation from Sharon Gadbois did I get that right all right who is a public affairs specialist with the U.S small business administration uh welcome us uh and uh let's uh let's hear your presentation so I don't like to bore everybody with like you know PowerPoints or anything like that so I'm just going to kind of give you a quick overview and then maybe go into a couple of examples so thank you so much for having me here Mr Mayor commissioner and definitely uh Kyle over there and so um the small business administration offers uh or our mission is to help homeowners renters non-profits and businesses of all sizes to prepare for respond to recover from and mitigate against disasters of all types whether it's man-made or natural so I'm sure you guys are familiar with Ian and also uh Nicole but we're talking specifically about Ian Pinellas County was considered a primary County um within the Ian SBA declaration and so we actually provide homeowners uh low interest disaster loans for physical property damage we also not includes you know if you have the roof damage or structural damage debris Landscaping fencing things like that also if there's any type of content inside the real estate structure itself that was damaged that would also be considered that's considered personal property we have a mitigation aspect to the physical property loan they would just need to ask like a loan officer case manager or something like that they definitely would have to have a physical property loan now if you were if bellina Beach was involved in another uh hurricane or another declaration from another storm within the last two years and then you know now they have gone through Ian they might want to consider calling their SBA loan officer case manager back and request a mitigation aspect uh maybe they might want to do some kind of house raising retaining wall or something like that for consideration because Florida does suffer a lot of Damages here whether it's hurricanes tornadoes water spouts those kind of things um also I know that Belair Beach doesn't have any businesses per se but sometimes there are solopreneurs serial printers that work from home um and all types of businesses are eligible to apply for a low interest disaster loans not just the physical so if their businesses maybe that work out of the home then um more than likely they would be eligible for the physical property damage for their home versus maybe the business but that would be a question of course for the loan officer and um the economic injury disaster line is for instance if they were a salesperson that sold let's say advertising to the media or something like that and they worked out of their home a lot of people work hybrid now or more from home than um they may be eligible simply because maybe you know people are spending their money on pre-existing you know getting their homes back to pre-existing conditions and so maybe now they don't have the extra funds to spend on other things like advertising and things like that um we were talking with Kyle earlier about secondary homes now there might be a possibility that there might be some homes on Baylor Beach that might be a secondary home now those homes wouldn't be eligible for the physical property damage if it was damaged during Hurricane Ian however if it was used as maybe rental income then that would be considered eligible does anyone have any immediate questions um I can tell you the interest rates if you're interested sure okay uh the interest rates are as low as 2.188 for homeowners and renters it's as low as 1.875 for non-profits and 3.04 for businesses and I like to kind of give an example of let's say a credit card example and so sometimes uh people are a do-it-yourselfer and so if they're kind of like that like right after Ian I know Pinellas County was without power at least 400 000 people without power so um it might have spoiled some kind of you know whether it's food or maybe you had some kind of whatever it was so if you're going to do it yourself or but maybe you had some kind of damaged roof damage or anything like that then um maybe it's possible that you are go to Lowe's or something like that and get all your supplies and maybe put all of your I don't know maybe it was 20 000 to fix a home and just picking a number out of the sky and you put it on the credit card well as we know credit card interest rates nowadays is 20 30 percent even pre-covet it's 10 maybe so let's say you had excellent credit pre-covered 10 on your credit card but you threw twenty thousand on there what happens if you don't make your payment on the 20 000 the first time and adds up right so you could actually pay yourself back for all of the money that you put on your credit card for the supplies to fix your roof not to 60 inch TV that you bought to watch hurricaneian okay so um you can pay yourself back with the low interest SAS loan and for homeowner and renter is 2.188 versus maybe 10 on the credit cards kind of a eight percent difference there any questions Council any questions no no no it's great information I'm going to send it out thank you so much um I left my card there if you would be uh kind enough to just email me um is it Zabo is that well um just email me and then I can communicate with you and if you have maybe I can send you some additional documentation yeah actually if you can I'll send the email to you and then what I'll do is I'll broadcast it out to a bunch of people it's like you know there's things that you just don't know that would be awesome thank you sure and um commissioner Roberts yes I was just going to ask um I don't have any particular issues at this time but if I know some people that may uh it sounds like it's already answered what's going to be the best way to get in contact with you so I actually left every single whenever one of my business cards and if you would be so kind um because Mr Roberts is to email me I would be happy to send you over some documents and um if you need some additional documents even if it's not related to like hurricane Nicole for instance you had somebody you know I can always communicate with you that way as well so just send me an email if you need to call me you can call me on my cell that's totally fine any other questions or comments from the council thank you very much Miss catboy thank you mayor all right we're on to item five which is quarterly board reports uh first off do we have a report from the board of adjustments please come right on up the story Mr Mayor of council Mike Deli Board of adjustment chairman good timing um yes we had a meeting this quarter yes we had an interesting hearing and with the help of Randy and with the help of Kyle and help of Patty we handled an administrative appeal something that board of adjustment normally doesn't handle but we did this time and Randy thank you very much for being so cautious as to how we handle it and Kyle thank you for bringing forward Pinellas uh the report by that planner because that definitely helped our case so it wasn't a normal variance we had one coming up on Thursday but it was administrative appeal any questions uh do you have a you have another one coming up and you said That's Thursday this Thursday is a regular variance for house yeah house on 22nd that's under construction Council the question are the minutes for these hearings that you were talking about on the City website everyone's free website not sure I know some of our members have attended um you know by um you know a couple of them have been out of town but they've been able to participate but I don't know that's on the website is it a website it's not we can put it up okay I'll check to make sure it is okay thank you yeah the one we had homemade administrative decision that the particular homeowner didn't agree with so our board was asked to to represent the city and make a judgment and with Randy's help that's exactly what we did thanks for being there now are you saying that the uh that the board of adjustment meetings are not being posted on the website it should be they should be yeah the question was specifically what are the minutes were on the website okay and it wasn't clear whether the minutes were it's not even clear that the minutes have been approved at a subsequent meeting yet so there's also that um that's that was their first meet this would be their first meeting since the meeting the gentleman's speaking about so if they're not on they'll certainly be on once the minutes are approved by the board all right any other questions or comments from the council no thank you very much Mr Kelly yes sir next up is the citizens advisory committee report thank you mayor Ron SEC Lennox as a citizen advisory Council chair we did not have a meeting this past quarter We are continuing to work on the project we talked about last quarter which is um working with the city manager assembling all of the variety of capital projects installed water projects and we're working with uh Bond Council and lenders to get some potential quotes to present at a work session here in the near term for you all to just decide if it's something worthwhile or not that's it all right Council yeah quick question what does the market look like these days for loans um probably interest rate for 15 years is around four and a half percent and so it's a little bit cheaper than the existing bond that we have and we have three years remaining on uh the good news is the 10-year truckers following the last two days so that's the rate prior to that so um hopefully the tenure keeps following around and we decided what we want to do then it'll be a good time Roger thanks yep and that is a tax exemplary thank you very much Mr saganic next up uh Park and Recreation board good evening everyone Tammy lavenda park and rec board chair so we had a very busy um fourth quarter l1d I'd like to thank all the volunteers that helped we had a very nice Halloween event our first annual chili cook-off went very well and then at our holiday social this year was very nice and we had our first annual toy drive um I would like to say goodbye and thank you so much to Nicole Miss hussman who is um resigning from the park and rec board because she um she moved out of Bellaire Beach but she still would continue volunteering and help us with the Community Foundation so we will still be seeing her around which is awesome um brought a couple of props for those of you that didn't come to the holiday social we have our Feller Beach logoed fanny packs for twenty dollars and then um we also have I wear my tall shoes so I can hold it extra large beach towels so if you haven't seen them they're very nice and we usually only buy like 35 of them so supplies are limited but you can get them um here at City Hall and then we also may have a table at the health and wellness fair for merchandise um we did have only two Beach cleanups um obviously October was canceled because of Ian and then park and rec board did our first annual resident survey for the walking easement which was a very fun project thank you so much um but for those of you that don't know our health and wellness fair is January 14th from 10 to 2. it's an open house format and we would love to see you all there we have a lot of really good health and wellness care providers that are attending this year so I think that's everything does anybody have any questions for me Council uh any questions yes Mr just quick note I bought two of those towels for full intent to use those in my swim practices and they were relinquished over and this is a good idea use them in your guest bathroom so we got two nice Littles you know Bellaire Beach shell type things in the guest bathroom now very nice we do still have some hand towels that are exactly like this like speaking of guest bathrooms I just we've had those for a little bit we don't have a lot of them left but we do still have some in stock oh and just one more question we will no longer be doing the t-shirts because we had a very difficult time trying to accommodate sizes and colors and um styles so we we literally get those at Mary Mouse which is right down by Columbia and Sand Key so you could almost walk down there a lot of us can and they will you know you can buy one at a time where we had to kind of buy in bulk so you can still get your Bellaire Beach t-shirts and tank tops and stickers but um Mary Mouse is where you can pick those up thank you thank you thank you very much Miss lavender all right next is Planning and Zoning Board good evening Council Rudy Davis standing

Council no thank you very much Mr Davis appreciate you coming out tonight all right item six city attorney's report Mr Mora you have the floor off to a new year um already well as usual in regular uh contact with the city manager and at the end of the year last year in December did a presentation with the league of cities as as my office often does on ethics uh public meetings and public records remember Livingston already attended that and continue to offer similar education around the state as it relates to this community this will be the first time I'm serving as your City attorney as we enter the legislative session uh we our office tends to monitor that session very closely we're already looking at what's getting filed before it gets into committee and start seeing where our new forms of preemption will come from our new unfunded mandates and the sorts of things that that may change uh the either your powers or what we do in this community and so as that happens we'll try to keep you updated I will try in my report to keep you updated of the ordinances not that just affect local government but that may affect local government as it relates to your community if any of you have particular concerns on the legislative agenda or the legislative session not that affect your private interest but those that relate to the city itself please let me know so I can make sure that I'm tracking those and meeting any expectations you have in that regard otherwise Happy to answer any questions Council thank you very much Mr Moore city managers report Mr Reaper you're up thank you so uh starting off with our 12th and 13th the Bay Street stormwater project uh we're getting very close to wrapping that up um you may have seen before the holiday uh them complete the paving I think they did a nice job on it um after the New Year on January 5th we did a walk through where we created a punch list for what we you know the things we saw that needed to be uh corrected on the project um some of those things were some basic cleanup some of it was we found some high high points in the uh Valley curb where they're gonna have to restructure so it drains properly fortunately the day we were out there was a it just had rain before so it kind of really showed where where the drainage needed to be uh adjusted um they've they've submitted their last pay app uh the engineer and I are reviewing it we have some uh some contentions on the quantities so we're kind of in the back and forth to get our measurements versus theirs um at this point we uh they're claiming that the paver restoration came out um even higher than our uh are as needed amount that was on the contract um we want to make sure that those measurements are correct um and then the other thing was the uh the required base eight inch base of a crushed concrete but um based on what the engineer uh measured for excavation we think we're gonna we're gonna come down on what they claimed to have used for that quantity so um once we have that all wrapped up um it looks right right now what they're uh submitted the payout for is uh they're over our total contract of about 26 000. um I'm expecting it to come down some but once that's finalized we will need to do a budget adjustment for that overage I will give you an update on that once we have the numbers but I want to make sure they're accurate the uh after they finish that um we televise the segments that go from uh the inlets to the Sea walls at both 12th and 13th um I have those I want to share those videos with you guys um I sent them to the engineer Engineers recommending um you know that we do some kind of cure in place liner to seal off the Integrity of those pipes they're not failing right now but they're um they're on their way and we the last thing in the honors for something to kind of fall in after we just um replaced a bunch of pipe in the system so I'm working on getting proposals for those for those segments so they can present them to you and show you the options we have while we're out there um cleaning the pipes on 12th Street segment uh we discovered that the check valve was not functioning properly um I was out there with one of my staff members and uh we we removed it um I contacted the manufacturer they are going to replace the valve because it um it kind of warped in a way that I've never seen before they've never seen it they're going to assess it and uh and give us a new valve so just be aware um if we do get any comments of the tide levels rise and people are seeing that the water's infiltrating the system that there is no check valve on 12th Street at the moment it's a 15 inch valve I didn't have a replacement um in-house to swap it out with so we're waiting on that but when do you anticipate having the replacement in it being installed they're usually pretty quick I would just I would imagine one of the two weeks I should have it we'll get it in immediately as soon as we can um it will it won't take very long um we we have it all cleaned out so just be popping down there when the water's low enough and getting it fastened um so uh the underground project that is uh it's continuing the Duke has ordered their supplies they expect this the conduit to come in within 30 days um once the material is in it'll be it'll be stockpiled at the marina and uh utility underground underground Consultants of Florida will uh we'll begin installing at that point so we should start seeing actual progress shortly on that the sea wall and boat ramp project that is that is pretty much wrapped up we are still working out the final pay app the uh the city staff after the last meeting we talked about that wheel stop that it actually became more of a burden on the wrap we went out there rented some tools and removed that wheel stop and then I got the contractor to come out to clear more of the sediment that was around the elf Falls and they moved it where that drop-off existed so um over time it's it's sloped off we want to still kind of make sure that it it's settled the way we want it so that so that a trailer can back up and not um have any kind of obstacle we're going to call it on anything um but uh so we moved that around the shortly after that I got the uh purchase orderly approved for the dock they came out they they've installed the dock um the dock has got a better design than the original because they on the Lower Landing um they actually put in piling for support as opposed to the way they kind of used to do it where they built it off the larger dock so that should hold up better um I left out a tie or a bumper pull that used to be on the old dock it can it could always be put back but one of the one of the complaints when talking to the residents about the old Dockers they thought when they backed up that they felt that the space was limited for when they backed up the trailer so that that bumper pull was sort of encroaching on the on the pathway of backing up so um if it becomes a problem I ordered some cleats that we're going to put on the Lower Landing so there's a tie off um but if we do notice that people are going to try to use the dock as some kind of Pivot Point um then we might reinstall a piling but I tried to open the space for now and see how that works um the city staff is still going to do the backfill so now that we have the doc complete I have Phil scheduled to be dropped off on Friday and we'll use our equipment to start back filling and then um we're going to order the sod so that we can restore the whole park uh there's a lot as the citizens advisory chair um told you that we're still investigating the the bond issue uh blown for the stormwater projects that is our determining Factor as far as where we're going to be at as moving forward with storm water so um if we get the loan the idea is that we're gonna try to combine all those projects to get them done the alternative would be if we don't do the loan then we are going to move forward with 17th 18th 19th 20th and 9th but either way we know it's a priority so um once we have that determined we will be designing and going to bid for the next projects whatever those are the code enforcement analysis um Steve presented a report in the old format this month but I'm working on next month a newer format some ideas that I've used from Resident feedback um I would like to incorporate a section that kind of shows more of the uh outstanding open violations that just tracks them better of whether it's uh something like a you know a house that isn't completed or a structure is not permitted it'll be more laid out so that some of those ongoing code enforcement uh steps that we're going through are just laid out and it can be followed by the residents and then another thing I wanted to do which I've been testing or playing around with on Excel spreadsheet but I want to tie in our different categories of code that we talk about in the survey so that I can lay it out in a in a uh a pie chart um to display kind of what we're covering month to month make it a little bit more visual the city hall generator rest uh we suggested that I reached out to cat um so I contacted cat Ring Power they did not currently have a used natural gas generator they're still looking for one so I can get a price on that currently they have diesel only um a resident after that pass meeting approached me with a um an idea for a his company was looking to auction off an existing generator they had um right now it's still kind of on the table where I'm looking at the price for the install if we were to attain that generator and in the transportation price it's I just want to get the numbers because I want to I want to explore the option um for consideration it would be a much larger generator but we'd be getting it at a very good price um just thought since it was out there but it's still an option I didn't investigate it to see just because we were talking about different options for generators uh the buoya replacement I got some prices on that the followed up um I put the application in for the for the uh US Army Corps of Engineers and the fdep before the holidays I followed up after the holidays it kind of went on a Hiatus for a little bit they at least with the uh Army Corps it's been assigned and I uh we'll keep following up with fdep to make sure I have their approval because I need their approval to go back to FWC with their application package um FWC is fully aware of uh the steps that I'm taking so that they're they don't learn compliance with uh attaining or pursuing a permit the uh 16 buoys I guess the prices were just to let you know what we're looking at the 16 buoys for our swim zone is going to cost roughly the uh about five thousand dollars and that's what all the uh that's the buoys only um but when you do the install the uh the contractor will uh put together the anchoring system and the stainless steel Hardware the pricing on the install has gone up significantly since the last time we installed 16 buoys it's uh almost doubled it's up to uh 20 000 800 this is a quote I got so I'm gonna shop around I'm going to look at uh some other options um with uh helical anchors and also I recently in contact with Clearwater Beach when we had the storm wash up some of their markers kind of talk to them about who they were using so I'm going to try and reach out and see if there's any kind of better pricing option uh I got the Morgan Park parking lot that's on the agenda we'll talk about that later uh some other quick notes the we're offering a CPR class our staff is due to be re-certified the CPR first aid that's going to be out of January 19th at 7 30 a.m here that's open to the public so if anyone is looking to get a CPR certification I believe it's going to be 60 base fee an additional it might be 50 basically an additional thirty dollars for this for the uh first aid part but you get the CPR for 50. um that will be uh put on by our local Suncoast fire department uh representative so um you know it should be a good class we'll we'll also advertise that in the health fair the RFQ um we got all those submissions we got six uh statements qualifications submitted the last week we had our uh our preliminary evaluation where we met and we scored the six we have a ranking order at this point um the recommendation is that we follow up with all six firms I'm looking at the January 18th of January 25th uh for uh interview time slots and I would like to bring in the firms and hear their uh you know quick presentations and and be able to ask them uh how they can tailor to our needs in the city and then we will score them based on those results and I expect to have a recommendation for agreements by the next council meeting the my old position the community services administrator um I'm down to two candidates and I'm planning on actually I'm both scheduled this week to come back for a secondary kind of informal interview I'd like for them to uh meet the Public Works staff and be shown around some of our facilities and see some of our equipment just to get a feel from the staff about the two candidates and then get that feedback before I make a decision but they're both great qualified candidates so we kind of lucked out um got about five applied but got some two quality candidates out of that five yeah that was that was solely from posting it on our City website and uh using some LinkedIn contacts so I was satisfied with that the uh we got the audit um we just approved and they should be on site in one to two weeks to start our uh annual audit I believe that's all thank you for the very thorough and detailed report but we greatly appreciate it Council any questions uh Mr Roberts pal and I had a couple conversations about this with the 12th and 13th Street project I think in the future Kyle I don't know if we address this in our conversation but the as needed um area if we can kind of in future um bids that we put out there that we minimize that as an example for the removal and reinstall of the papers if we could have had that in the original bid so we weren't really leaving it up to them with respect to what they were going to charge us per square foot or square yard or whatever measurement they use so that would be part of the original bid because as we all know anytime a contractor gets an opportunity to come up with their own numbers it's going to be not a good one for us so yeah we could include that in there for that removal that would help as a recap they it was included in the original bid it was included as as needed items so they could provide that price um but it would the way it was handled um with the PO and the contract was um not having it built into the PO it was said that the Adida would come out of the contingency of the 10 of the contingency yeah so it was bid on no no I get that but it would be um in our conversation you were saying that they they included it as an as needed so we didn't know what their unit price was going to be but we we did we did know the unit we'd have a bit a price on it you included that yes okay but we didn't know what the actual measurement was I think they could have actually defined that the engineering firm could have taken the time to define the areas that those papers existed and and if something was added uh from a homeowner once the bids went out again that unit price would apply but I think we would do a better job of tightening that up so they don't have the ability to come back later and we're in the situation we are in now where we're saying that price you gave us is too high so anything we can do to kind of tighten that up would be it would be a good thing okay um on the generator so I know you mentioned this earlier that it um Pat had some that were diesel again one of the places I came from before we had multiple generators out there for each building and we did have uh diesel tanks so typically you know obviously based on the size of the diesel tank so if they have a good price on something I wouldn't walk away from that I guess it's my only point because we could use Diesel and then we can have a contract with a diesel provider that they guarantee us uh during any type of an event it's guaranteed that they will provide us with diesel fuel when we need it now is that a perfect thing probably not you know I mean if they just say they're at but they're supposed to provide it once they sign a contract so we could provide if we got a good price again on a diesel generator that still may be a good option for us even though we would prefer I'm assuming because we have natural gas right yeah it's more reliable but yeah it's a good point okay yes sir anyone else uh yes uh let's go with Miss Livingstone Kyle question for you what's your timeline for completion on the seventh uh vlog so so the doc is done um I got Phil Dirt coming in on Friday uh with my staff I would I want to have it done by the end of the month um probably before that but involving um ordering the sod and getting it getting it thrown down mixed in with other things is there a maintenance schedule as far as because there seems to be a lot of debris that comes up just when we walk on a regular basis that comes up is there some sort of a maintenance schedule to keep that debris out of there um I recurrent maintenance schedule is one at least once a week or when cited um when they come by and see that that's accumulation it hasn't been cleaned during the project we've kind of let it accumulate until we had to clean it so right now I think it's got its own there uh Mike Sable uh yeah great list uh you're missing some things let's go over it Michelle Kyle and I've been working together first thing I want you to know I don't know city council knows but right now we are streaming uh our medians live we have both a taped and a live meeting so people can join in starting at six o'clock on our Council night so again thank you Kyle um next was uh you may notice here on the causeway that uh I was talking to some people various citizens got together with Kyle we had a meeting with the county and the citizens and we got a brand new fence installed uh County came and installed it nice black beautiful uh next thing obviously we're working on is landscaping and potential funding for a fountain but the last one is a weird one um I got a phone call last week and it was about a floating um piling in the water about an 18th footer uh obviously that would probably injure day if you hit it with a boat or it could damage boat lists Etc I was able to get a rope on it pull it in and tie it up to appear but the next day Kyle showed up with a complete crew and who's the ruled one instead of just kind of grabbing the real cow had to swim trunks on he waited out [Music] the edge of the sea wall uh and then their team put it out chopped it up put it in there so uh Kudos that's one hell of a move there buddy um so that's what we're looking at so uh thank you very much for all your work anyone else on the council no um 12th and 13th I'm sure that we've learned quite a few lessons on that one uh it definitely uh it has been a more of a challenge than we probably initially expected uh I think overall everyone's pretty happy with with the outcome and it looks great uh the 7th Street uh back to the boat ramp the edge of that ramp where it was doing the drop off was that would you consider that to be a design flaw do you think that the engineers or the uh the installer did it incorrectly and now we've kind of had to patch it up to make it usable I will follow up um with the engineer to get his of his opinion he's got a lot of experience with seawalls and docks or boat ramps in the area um I I would have to ask his opinion on that one because we went out uh 10 feet um in his design um and the idea is when we first went out there to figure out how big the existing was it we tracked it to about eight feet so we wanted to go further than that now the um the actual the way that the sand was at the time it kind of came up over that ramp so like you you ran out into the sand um I don't know in the uh process of dredging and moving that all around if it got moved so that that ramp just became like where it caved out Beyond it um but if I'd like I'll get an answer for you on that and see um he's fully aware of the situation I proposed um the idea of moving it back so that it wouldn't you know it wouldn't be a drop off and uh he approved of it um but yeah my biggest fear is that we took a functioning boat ramp pulled it out and put a non-functioning boat ramp in its place um it'll get the boat out there but if you can't bring it back and if this is a recurring problem uh I guess my question is is do we have any recourse on the installer and the the engineer who designed it uh just to uh uh even if it involves digging it out and redoing it uh we we want to make sure that even though it's a very small boat ramp people that are using it can actually still use it right so uh that's uh that's like comments on that uh other than that like I said great report I appreciate all your hard work uh it's nice to see the progress and the transparency anyone else I just add just to your boat ramp uh comment is it possible to just talk to the engineer about adding rip rap which is not unusual to have you know some rock stabilization at the end of the it'll stop the dirt from moving it'll kind of just solve the problem so you might just discuss that with them okay that's a that's a good comment okay thank you very much Mr riepler and now we are on to item eight that's the city clerk's report this Gentry you have the floor um I I'm on the website adding and deleting all day long so I didn't want to say that I had put it on there until I looked at it again but I did I just checked it the board of adjustment yes it was put on there last week so it's on the home page and then if you just click on it it has a full packet so you know that's a normal procedure and just for so okay and that's my report all right thank you uh any questions for Mr Gentry no all right thank you very much uh Now we move on to items nine and ten this is the consent agenda now this is for approval of the November 14 2022 city council work session minutes and the December 5th 2022 city council meeting minutes all in favor hi hi any opposed all right the consent agenda passes all right next up item 11 regular agenda this is for consideration of appointment of a new Park and Recreation board member uh we have one candidate which is Mr John Wagner is Mr Wagner here tonight and if so would you like to introduce yourself to the council um Mr Mayor council members John Wagner 107 6th Street moved here about two years ago and I've been involved with the parks and rec activities and I really enjoyed them my wife and I really loved it in there and Bel Air Beach and I'm looking to contribute thanks for your consideration thank you very much before we go to the council I need to ask if any citizens would like to speak concerning this possible appointment yes yes please step right up I would Tammy lavender 97 Harbor Drive I would just like to say that John Wagner would be a great addition to the park and rec board team he has participated in Beach cleanups Halloween events chili cook-off he's he and his wife are very actively involved in almost everything that we do and he would be a great asset to our team thank you thank you very much foreign costume for the dogs my dog all right before we go to the council I need a motion to appoint Mr Wagner as a member of the Park and Recreation board I do I have a motion Summit motion made by Mike zabel do I have a second second by Leslie Notaro Mike Sable you have the floor no revealing uh the application uh thoroughly experienced looking forward to bringing you on board any other comments or questions from the council yes Mr Robert yeah I did actually have an opportunity to uh taste his children and I think he had pheasant is that correct was the secret ingredient it was excellent it was very good though thank you um any other questions or comments no all right well uh let's take it to a vote uh we're going to do a roll call vote Patty yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council member Sable yes vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess hi so uh passage unanimously uh Mr Wagner you are now on boarded and uh thank you for stepping up all right item 12. this is for consideration to authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order for resurfacing the Morgan Park parking lot Mr reefer you have the floor okay so this purchase order is the um authorize Baker Paving uh for the Milling overlay and re-striping of Morgan Park parking lot in the amount of 18 805 uh maker Paving uh proposed the most competitive price of three separate proposals um and they are the payment company who just recently performed on 12th 13th and Bay Drive which I thought was quality work I did some uh some digging into the history of the parking lot um I could not find the the actual date the the oldest part the middle section of the parking lot was paved is in my estimation it's definitely over 15 years old probably more um I I included some pictures of some of the wear and tear just if you haven't been out there recently to see some of the weathering um rutting there's some transitional cracking going through a little in some different areas some of the the base is exposed um but uh the last time anything was done in that parking lot was when we expanded uh for some additional parking spaces I think related to the uh nourishment of the beach and uh you can see the the in the pictures you'll see the line difference between asphalt that's about five years old and the older asphalt um the uh the budget uh we have a currently have funding um in the budget accumulated up to 35 000 and um it was uh described for Milling resurfacing and concrete uh replacer further Kirby and walkways I looked at the existing curbing the walkways I would say that we don't need any uh funding going towards that at the moment thank you for explaining that to us uh before we go to the council let's go to the citizens would anyone like to speak on this topic nope all right so we're back to the council before we go to discussion I need a motion to authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order for resurfacing the Morgan Park uh Morgan Park parking lot uh do I have a motion motion uh by Leslie nataro and do I have a second second by Lloyd Roberts uh Leslie you have the floor I think the memorandum and the estimates speak for themselves I think we need to go ahead with it other council members yes Mr Roberts so Kyle for this particular project that we typically put together a request for bid where we detail is because it's under a certain number how does the city typically handle that um since it's under 25 000 we uh request proposals um and I give them the uh the parameters okay I saw them uh at least a inch milling and overlay um that they had to restripe okay excellent the reason I asked was I know there was some slight differences in the actual bids that were submitted uh in a positive way I mean the winning the winning company actually is going to do inch and a quarter which is great so um but so they just did that on their own yes that's right recommended it all right thanks other council members no I I did have a uh just one it's probably a dumb question but I'm going to ask it anyway um what it has saved us any money if we had rolled this project into the 12th and 13th Paving project I talked to him about it when we were discussing that Paving and due to the mobilization the distance between the two jobs he did not think so at all no because I was I did consider that before the holiday trying to get them in before the plans shut down but he told me that it wouldn't make a difference all right thank you I have no other questions anyone else nope all right so let's take it to another roll call vote Patty would you please call council member Livingstone yes yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts I'm council member Zabo aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor Gaddis aye and so it passes unanimously Mr reefer you are authorized to proceed thank you okay on to unfinished business we have any unfinished business at this time oh right going right along we are on to item 14 which is uh Council comments um you know I have so much fun doing this with the computer so it's never going to be the same way twice except for the fact that uh vice mayor Shirley goes next to last and I go last this time the computer picked Miss Livingstone to go first so you have the four oh good um I just have two questions the first one is in the in a previous meeting and this might not be the forum for this and I apologize in the previous meeting um we were talking about the piping and we couldn't find the documents um for that particular piping where we had an issue and then in the one for the paving we couldn't find the documentation for that Paving I don't know if there's been some laws enacted since all of this has taken place but what measures are we taking to make sure that we're able to find appropriate documentation moving forward and this is no reflection on you by any means I just have that question um I'm glad you asked uh the city clerk and I've kind of discussed uh what would make it easier when going through our records area um it's all physical papers and and bins so there's no easy way um some of the some of the more current stuff it's on computer and we can search it um using modern technology but some of the older stuff and this I think predates um what we can search on a computer it you have to go through and and and kind of look at different indexes and trying to figure out when it possibly could occurred um our solution and um I want to get some prices on it is to try to go start going electronic okay so that we can start filing and make it a lot more searchable okay okay thank you and the next question just has to do with work sessions how often do we have those and when is the next one coming up well funny you should ask uh I am planning on having one on uh two weeks from today uh Monday I believe it's the 23rd um so uh darn that was all I was going to talk about I'll bring it up later though sounds good apologies thank you oh and also uh just so you know uh whenever it's your turn to speak you can talk about anything you want to as long as you want to except for you may hit a point if you are too long where you have to buy us all pizza but other than that I think I think we'll work through it and remember Livingstone more to the point on on work sessions they're not on regular intervals or at least have not historically been over the last six months um there's been a lot that this ambitious uh Council has been working on so in some months we had you know four or or more but that's not that's the exception not the rule um so it's the the fact that one's coming up is an indication of oh okay Greg we're gonna have to do that but um it's not something you can plan your clock by that way and we try to coordinate member schedules when we do have those sort of unanticipated hey we need to fill a vacancy we need to pass something quickly before the legislature does something or because of a hurricane or whatever else we try to give as much notice as we can for those kinds of special meetings and workshops okay thank you we typically at least try to one uh I uh but in December we try to give everyone a break all right next up the computer picked Lloyd Roberts oh good um thank you Marin I had a conversation earlier today with my friend Randy and what I would like to recommend or propos is I think it's wonderful that we started a meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance in addition to that I think we should actually open the meeting including a prayer I worked for a state Organization for many years and they had a board that was appointed by the governor and every monthly meeting that we had along with the Pledge of Allegiance somebody opened the meeting with a prayer so I would like to propose that we do that and I think you mentioned the upcoming Workshop I would like that to be an item on that Workshop where we discussed that and hopefully come up with a plan as to the best way to make that happen I think anytime we can get some help from somebody uh via the prayer that would be a good thing so that's my recommendation thank you and uh I like that idea also and we uh we will add that to the work session to be discussed and I will also add that uh in the various meetings that I attend uh throughout the county a majority of them actually do open with a prayer and then they do a pledge so you're not the only person who thinks that way anything else nothing all right thank you very much all right next up is Mike zabel cool um since we're going out live I just want to reiterate uh if you want to contact me numbers 301-943-3443 don't worry about calling me just call me leave a message I'll talk to you uh second of is my email is mike.zabel at cityofbillarybeach.com a reason to bring that up is during the latest hurricane this city has and I got to watch the terminology here there's a considerable number of people that find it difficult to lift 35 pound bags and let them fill them and place them at their residence and what I'm asking for is if you need assistance or you have problems doing that physicality is I'm trying to assemble one list of those people with their addresses and compile that or match that to another list of volunteers that want to come out here when we say it's come out early throw the sandbags for these people and then distribute it to these houses too often it's maybe one person knows of somebody but a lot of these people really and I gotta say it they don't have friends they don't have an extended Network and too often they fall between the cracks and when you're between the cracks chances are you know you could be injured or die so I'm looking for that is you know come back to me we'll get some names assembled I like to break before the council to see if we can put that up that there's a series of people that you know maybe that we can keep it hidden but they have matched volunteers to assist them during uh sometimes a hurricane that's all I have thank you thank you Mr zabel next up Leslie Notaro no proof of the comments no comment vice mayor Shirley um I just I want to I saw Nicole leave sorry that we didn't get a chance to say thank you but she's done a great job helping with the Parks Board and uh I really if you guys see her tell her thank you for all of her service we do appreciate it and John thanks for stepping up we appreciate your help and really if there's anyone else that's you know looking to assist with the city I'm sure there are plenty of board positions see Patty she's always looking for help around the city and just thanks for coming out and participating in the meeting thank you vice mayor all right uh as I mentioned earlier our next work session is on Monday January the 23rd a few of the items that will be discussed include uh the new sign ordinance and uh buoys on the beaches um there's been some discussion uh it was originally raised by uh the council member bankard about placing buoys on the south end of I still considered our beach even though it's not our beach in name and then also discussing uh holiday Lighting on Golf and Causeway boulevards I'm sure other things will be added but there's a little sneak preview of uh of just initial items that's been discussed um also I'd like to thank everyone who attended tonight happy New Year and uh with that being said do I have a motion to adjourn ES okay all right do I have a second all right uh all in favor aye aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
