studying it I suggested then that something remedial needs to be done in the interim um I don't know what's going on I look at the uh sheriff's report about accidents it just tells you where the accidents are it doesn't give you any details or anything like that but something's going to happen there it's going to be bad so I'm just bringing it to the council's attention and I'm imploring you

Memorial we are currently at 60 approximately 67% of our goals so thank you to everyone who has donated so far um we really appreciate it we're still just trying to raise a little bit more money for the sign and then the fountain and then I have a few more details um there will be a a dedicated um bricks um surround surrounding the fountain so there's a couple of examples on the board so they're um 8 by8 bricks so they're the double size and they'll be $200 and we're hoping because there's only 20 of them that each of them will be dedicated to your loved one who has served in the military um and I think that's all I thank you very much I appreciate it all right we're on to item number three which is a presentation for the pelis county sheriff's department uh I'm sorry officer I did not get your name so would you please uh tell us who you are and what your title is certainly good evening my name is Sergeant John shield with P County Sheriff's Office um I'm here to present the uh stats that you all have have received already previously should have receiv received them in an email uh if you all have any questions about any statistics I answer that all right do you have the report I do if you don't mind just kind of share the highlights most people in the audience have not seen that report sure no worries uh so it's broken down in monthly end we have the uh it's kind of uh 6 months I'm sorry six weeks in so we're in March so with the present uh Prime stats that we have for the month of March 2024 uh so in the March uh we have four people arrested the city of b beach uh they are broken down into different felony misdemeanor traffic felonies and broken down into stats there were 644 events in the city of Val Beach um with 728 units responding units are comprised of Deputy sheriffs there were three traffic crashes in the city um for the month of March um they may include accident and hit and run divided up we have 212 citations to to include warning citations for the city also they're broken up I believe 97% of them uh are listed as parking citations we have uh 95 of them are warnings and 20 are issued traffics any questions or comments for the sergeant coun yes thank you Sergeant uh I did notice on the um I guess the second page that it does reference an accident um involving Causeway Boulevard and goard do you have any T any data on that particular one I don't I given General uh stats broken down uh for instance the deputy activity is broken down to what they out code on and what traffic control uh suspicious vehicles and such when it comes to the um tra traffic crashes the county gives a there's one at 103 it's listed as our location of what we utilize for our our accident reports 1038 Street uh 3100 golf Boulevard and Howard Drive at the intersection of the Golf Boulevard I know those are a little few of them are a little vague but um that's what we have so we have the three of those in the city okay yeah I miss read that that's my thought that is a citation that was awarded on cway Boulevard and go Boulevard so but I do have another question I was curious about the two assaults in March 24th again any detail on those I don't have any details know they're just broken up we have a uniform uh it's a UCR it's a data that we're collecting that our analysts collect and it's within our computer system kind of generates we kind of classify those but I don't have any details on those recuits is there a way what would be the easiest way for us to get that information want uh we can uh look into getting it from the crime analysis okay and about that specifically right thank you anyone else I did have a a question Sergeant there was a over the weekend there was a pretty serious accident on gold Boulevard but I believe it was in San you may have heard about it I did I was actually off this weekend so it's my first day back to work I did see it through media uh I don't know the details other than involving a pickup truck and a semi truck the the details and nuances of that I do not answer okay all right um yeah I guess what we'd like to do is find out more about for sure all right anything else Sergeant I appreciate you being here tonight thank you very much my pleasure have a good evening you to and is Deputy Trump here tonight yes sir we to the monthly code enforcement report how you doing tonight how are you sir doing well again Deputy Trump with County Sheriff's Office I try and help you guys out with your code enforcement uh for the month um for the month uh I have 34 entries um a lot of them varied and stuff but what we're basically finding for the the month is we're starting to get into that growing season so we're trying to make sure everybody with their yards and stuff like that are trying to keep them for PLS about that so we've been doing a lot of patrols there talking a lot of people I get out and I'm do and I talk to a lot of people and you know trying to get to come back into compliance with that uh you'll notice the other big topic was pretty much other enforcement other enforcement is a staff that I actually had added to it um but that will vary as far as um uh doing my beach patrols cuz I've been trying to get out and do a lot more Beach patrols out on the Polaris and trying to talk to a lot of people out there and making sure everybody's enjoying and being safe um so uh we also had I'm sorry so besides that uh other also included a couple things we had a jet ski that was unauthorized up at the marina that uh uh the city manager helped take care of uh along with the the rest of the city staff and uh we had a boat and a trailer in the front yard um I talked to that Doan out twice and I think we got that one straightened out but he takes his boat out you know it's got to go away pretty quick instead of sitting there for a week so we've dealt with that so um for the rest of it it it's pretty much pretty minor um we uh do have one note here that uh had references the 107 21st Street property this property uh has been in pretty bad shape uh especially for the last 6 months that I've been here I know a lot of neighbors have complained about it the city's been working with it and there's actually fines that are um growing on that property so right now just to inform you there is a title company and there's actually s sign in front of it now uh but there is a title company that is taking control of the property uh it's going into a trust and then the title company will be bringing the property into compliance uh in the very near future from what I hear uh and I'll keep you guys updated on that uh as we progress and I'm sure the city manager will also uh but after that then they are going to work with the city and the attorney uh in order to try and come up with some type of settlement for all the fines and wings that are cled on so any questions yes thank you for the detail regarding the other category that was one that I had a question about that as it approaches one of the offenses I'm wondering if that should be down in any way categories in the future I can try to I can work with the city manager see if I can break that down for you uh but before like if I went out I I try to uh take numbers and make sure that we have statistics on other things that I'm doing like the beach patrols and things like that that weren't documented before so with that I was able to work with the city manager we at least got that entry but I can work with them see if we can't break it down a little bit more for you that will help sure any other questions Mr thank you uh for the report and thank you for bringing up the point about the the U height of the grass and theut so that's basically 50% and I think that I feel very fortunate the street that I live on everybody does a great job taking care of those Pilots I think that this city overall really wants the city to look as nice as it possibly can yes sir so I think it's wonderful that you are bringing that to our citizens ATT attention those that may not be complying with our current um rules about grass height and cl and things like that so thank you for good the simplest way that I can put it without going into there's a bunch of different details it's based in grass and weeds if it's over 7 in it's not importance so just kind of keep the grasses cut and keep them under 7even in keep the bushes trimmed and everybody should be happy okay thank you all thank you next up item four a presentation from the pel sun fire and rescue District by Chief Jeffrey Davidson Chief good mayor how are you council members good evening uh it's here present the uh fire and rescue report for the month of April there were 15 calls for emergency services to beach including motor vehicle accidents party events and fire alarms we recently outfitted a new jet ski uh for to add to our water rescue Fleet maranian Fleet and the training is underway um hoping to have it here on display uh for you all uh at the next meeting um currently uh we just finished Coast Guard um water rescue training with the Coast Guard and once we finish at the training that that unit will be in service um we also have been working as you know to purchase the land on the Northern of Indian Rock Beach a better serve belir Beach and that's moved along very well we'll have the contracts completed in the next week and we'll move forward and hopefully we'll have a new fire station to better serve your area uh and less than two years that's the goal and then our Mainland station which we're in the design phase we're continue with that we're just waiting on some engineering to see what we can do with the Retention Ponds over there and uh keep moving for any questions or comments no thank you very much sir have a good evening thanks for having me number five City attorney report thank you Mr Mayor um since our last meeting I've been uh researching uh how different communities have adapted to sign code revisions I've been Gathering that information including in addition to just general research series public records requests of different communities and getting that material together so as directed I can meet with member sha Elliot and have a a discourse on Gathering that information in a way that will be helpful and just here's a flood of information um in addition to that of course working with the manager on day-to-day issues we are almost exactly two months post the close of legislative session and honestly there is a lot up in the air um remember recall that the process is that both Chambers pass identical bills those bills if passed in identical form are at some point transmitted to the governor and the governor signs them or vetos them um he has 15 days to do so once a bill is transmitted to him um and if if the governor does not sign it within those 15 days it seem to pass so for those of you remember the L of the pocket in the '90s it's a pocket approval in the our state system um there are many bills that were passed that still have not been sent to the governor um notably uh the short-term rental bill that a lot of communities were tracking housing Bill Transportation bill there's just a number of them that are sort of in limbo that doesn't mean he will be Ving him they just have not been sent to him and there's not necessarily a date certain that they will all be sent by uh most bills are typically sent by now or at least mid June because a lot of bills tend to have an effective date of July 1 so you want to have them sign you know at least two weeks out from that or have a 15-day window before that uh so we expect to see a little bit more motion but if you're you know if you track something or or there was a legislative issue that was near and dear to your heartbreak session you're wondering why am I not hearing about this or why are we not doing anything yet it ain't over till it's over it's got to be signed and so we are tracking that closely but I do want to make make that known it's a little bit curious um bunch of theories on why it happens some some way but it is a very it's a truly arcade process and that is like the final document sits in a drawer and until it is summoned it sit under the Locking key and so we're waiting for those those side to be summoned by the governor or otherwise get to his desk so um other than that happy to answer any questions you may have um I also just because it was a topic of of discussion at at April's meeting I continue to remain in we contact with the um whether it just be a simple phone call to check in or otherwise with the attorney um for the town of B Shore uh the parties are both generally amenable to working through towards a revised document the interal agreement of course the details matter and we'll see where that goes um but there's at least right now both parties are postured towards let's work this out um and so that's where that presently stands I think my my your colleague is awaiting some direction similarly I'm you know meeting with pile and identifying what of the issues our community would need addressed in a Revis and and also recently reached out to Banker to meet with him in the same regard so that's uh where that is happy to answer any questions I have a question where are we on the Lo period there's an ordinance on the agenda okay for some reason I didn't read it the same way know uh you may if you were tracking it through the entire process recall that when when you first said you know this is a priority we want this as a council we want this prioritized my concern at the time was um it may need to go before the Planning and Zoning Board did um and and they considered all the provisions and looking at it I thought it best to break them out into multiple ordinances um so that's you have three ordinances tonight land restrictions that are it was a little confusing I was reading it but I'll make it clear when we get there thank you very much uh any questions for the City attorney this is no reflection this is just about on the back page um you gave us a letter after the meeting after last month meeting April s in page two there was a February 28 citation and Kyle took a drun of this storm from a resident at the last meeting that there was authorized partment permit that was issued um reflecting that I don't know if you ISS I don't really care ISS you took theun but I visit the six stre beach access and this is what I'm talking about okay now I come from the construction trade I'm sympathetic construction workers B Shores wants to tell us what we can and what we can't do meanwhile they issue these parking permits at will okay now I've also copied on the back page B shortest code paring permits and I'm not I'm just going to paraphrase such paring permits shall only be issued as may be provided by the Board of Commissioners to the the property owners in the city of Bor Beach east of goth Boulevard and shall be number these guys aren't east of this east of golf bullevard all right they're construction workers they're given a permit to parked here all year this thing goes from February till the end of December all right our our intercal green also Nots who can park in these Lots east of goth B the residents of balair beach the Deeds from the Kirk PE on out also notes who can park and who can use these lots and what are the purposes to be used Beach invading purposes now if b beach and B Shores wants to really get along okay they have to they have to comply and give us equal treatment is what I'm saying so I know you're in talks with them a lot and I would bring this up because one day there was 10 cars apart in in Beller and in the six Street AIS and the one guy backed up I was coming off the beach it was two well I'm old now so I I can say there was two older women okay one one in a wasn't a wheelchair with an assist he backs all the way up 2T from the access point where the grand starts and she says I can't get around it so I went I went up I said hey how about moving your truck he says I'm busy doing paperwork thank God Robert Shaw that comes pulling it he pulled right out but what I'm saying is he had no right to partner and this is just bad behavior on their M Banker I appreciate you bringing this tangible example to my attention what I would say is one we are as as I've stated I I think that the to the extent of been in contact with their officials I think that all those representations of working uh toward a resolution are in good faith I'd also caution um as we work through this process um just generally understanding especially in these small communities as we see turnover like we're talking about an agreement that goes back almost 20 years right and we've seen a lot of turnover in our communities in those 20 years there's not always an an awareness or an appreciation and that doesn't necessarily excuse it away but I would not suggest that it's necessarily always malicious and so I I agree with you that we need to bring this to their attention and we need to address it and and this needs to be not just on the list of things we address long term but near term making them aware of that concern and I'm happy to do that and again he got I okay and I don't think get I don't know what circumstances where like I said I don't have a problem with construction workers partner if they work work and we can navigate them thank you for bringing that to our attention I'll I'll make note of that any other questions or comments for the City attorney you have anything else no thank you m right thank you very much and now we're moving on to the city manager report Mr Bri for you're up thank you mayor uh start off with the adult Boulevard undergrounding last month we uh did a contract with the UCF to install the conduit for the rest of the communication portion of the uh phase two North Side well north and east side of Bel Boulevard and good news is that um the material should be arriving within a couple of weeks and think they're going to get started on that the uh storm water Improvement project um currently we're still working up from uh Morgan drive down to 23rd Street um they are replacing the curves and you know they'll do the milling and reserving for those four streets and after that the plan is to come down to this uh south portion which is going to be the Ninth Street Harbor Drive um Cedar Drive Spruce Drive and Palm Drive um speaking on that I'm going to try to share a screen but member sha Elliot and I went out and met with the two property owners for the for the uh options that we were looking at uh when during our work session the concern was um would they be willing to have um that pump station and power panel in front of their properties and what we found in meeting with the neighbors is that they would prefer not get out of um The Pump Station out in front uh that would be between 9007 and 905 Harvard so um since then since learning that from these residents um and actually Mr will and Mr Brown are both here tonight um to support the project um we started looking at other options um right now given um that the previous options we have aren't going to work out our next best option is going to be um what I'm showing on the screen right now which is going to be our option one um which would require an easement with the property in the screen um which is 1259 Street uh we feel they may be willing to give an eement because the idea is to run um from the from the corner where that Mano is um slightly into the property which is all grass area but in doing so it avoids uh there's a line of oak trees um if we if we couldn't get in eement and we had to go north we would be um running into those old trees and may be required to we'd have to remove them so that's our our next best effort um the residents of the area are helping us get in contact with the owner of that property to hopefully negotiate um being able to get that eement so that we can reduce the flooding in the area U the other option we're looking at I want to jump to my other this shows me better okay so this is a a shot I took from the corner and so this on the left where it says Pump Station option one easement so that kind of shows you the line of sight um going from that manhole it has to cut to the West a little bit uh the property line for 1259 street is slightly to the west of that telephone pole directly in front of the screen um but with the easement we'd be able to move more over into the grass area to get the pump station roughly um just past the property before to the the existing pipe that runs from their attention Pond the idea would be to put the pump station in that area and then um trench the uh force force line across to the sell through the road um the other option pump up station op two um that would be to go directly across the road and position it we'd have to keep it to the south of the Swale because we could cross over the well and we can't go through the pipe in the boat um but that would be the less uh preferred option to put Pump Station in that general area it's far away from being from the property owner's house to to eject the water into the spell same same way and I have some arals too to kind of show op one and option two and I spoke with uh Larry flu city engineer um he's aware of what we're looking into it's really pending um when we can get in contact of the property article in 259 street so hopefully we can do that soon um to narrow down if that is a feasible option then we can get him to start um drafting the plans to get a cost estimate um the one both these options um we can still move the project down to this area um and at this point we'd be able to replace the um Valley curb in Middle up to um just north of uh Mr Brown's driveway and then what we could do is not um do the replacement of the remainder of Harbor Drive that borders to park um we could do that in the future um with this project if we felt um we still needed to do so the curves and the street aren't in horrible conditions I don't think it would negatively affect anything but that way we wouldn't be uh refurbishing the streets and curves um only to tear them up again so that's a quick update on where we're at with that hopefully I was able to show you um the ideas and you can understand I don't know if um later we want to give an opportunity to the two Property Owners to speak on it but um they they support the project um and they've been working with us to find a a a reasonable way to put the bomb station and make it work anything else I do have s Banker has a question for you sure option one at that house doesn't that take a lot of um the house at 1259 Street does take a lot of fighting so we felt that they would they would feel strongly that well day um so again what I will uh keep the city council um aware of where we're at on that our progress as we try to make contact with that Resident um the code review project U Mr is compiling all his recommendations for us to review and we will be um putting together the draft ordinances again most of them are going to be more restrictive but we want to get started um for review to can look over and uh for more discussion on what we're recommending the oh call calll Boulevard um and CER Boulevard intersection study we did have an update on that the FAS County Public Works invited member Robert and I out on May 1st I believe it was Wednesday and they uh showed us the um camera that they installed at the intersection they the camera is is is kind of the best technology they have that they're using within the County right now um when they learned about our um our uh our need to to study the intersection and to to analyze if it's working most efficient um way they they thought sell it as an opportunity that we kind of looked down on and got it installed so now that we have it it's um it's operates on AI software very Hightech they showed us um real live Imaging of the Hide up camera identifying vehicle washing go through the intersection it can um it operates on demand so there has I've noticed personally when they asked and um and it's mainly because the the computer is watching the traffic patterns and and it's changing the lights not on a timer but more so in realz in what best way to to change the lights to get the most D through the intersection I've noticed uh uh increase in um um well I just say decrease in backup I've noticed early in the morning one of the major complaints that residents had was you know pulling up to the L 6:00 a.m. in the morning nobody's at the intersection nobody's coming in any direction you're sitting there for almost over a minute which seems like an attorney that early um that's gone away I don't know if the uh the previous well whatever they were using motion sensor just wasn't picking up but this this new technology is definitely doing a better job I have a question about this um actually to uh first when when was that system installed I want to say early April that's probably why whenever the turn signal is turned off and it's to Green bre through lights occasionally it'll turn back on and let you make that left turn if your headed because it's toting the cars there's nothing coming it must just automatically uh by any chance does this technology uh will it Aid and the maybe resolving the concerns that were um addressed it it should be able to because it it it can uh recognize near misses and obviously um to their knowledge now it's only been running for like a matter of weeks um they showed us a report example they showed all the accounts um they can get the data on how like they could tell the speeds the traffic was moving through in all different directions they can tell near misses they can tell when the car comes out of the lane like it it's very very complex they offered um they're going to send me a report uh based on their recommendation and what their recommendation to us is at this moment that they feel the intersection works most efficiently with this technology install the way it is with the two lanes going left what they did feel when they really looked at it over and U analyzed the numbers was that the when you turn left you have the uh the I should say delineating lines that um guide the two lanes as you turn they felt that um we could use another set not in not just in between those Lanes but another set on the far which would be the east lane turning the left to go over Causeway to help them guide them to not cut short on the uh Stop Bar um another thing they thought that would make a difference is um repainting those lines all the way through so once you make the turn you're heading towards the bridge um they're kind of worn out so it um they felt like it would marking it better would uh help traffic stay stay in the lanes but at the same time we as soon as you turn to col Boulevard there's a merge era so um I guess you know the guys that work at the Traffic Division felt like that could be playing into the fact soon as people turn they see that merge ARA so it's causing them to feel like they got to get right over um there's plenty of space that you know it extends almost all the way up to Cedar Drive and they felt that that might also um help with that intersection it's not perfect but where we're at right now um with the new camera they got in there um they really can tell what's going on they you know like I said they can tell if there was an accident um they offered to share this data with us so um as we move forward I think if we have questions you know concerning near misses concerning accidents speeds um they can provide that data and I think it'll be very helpful I don't want to keep talking about traffic all night but I I would say that I think we've suggested possibly moving that Stop Bar the line that's painted the thick white line it tells where you're supposed to stop your car at as you're waiting to make a left turn or a right turn um at the end of C way thing was moved back they could make a less drastic turn and I believe that that would help because right now it's almost impossible if you're doing the speed limit and you go around that curve you're going to go the other way so that's something that I think we have discussed it before but maybe it just hasn't been brought up any questions or comments for yes yeah first of all I think the count County uh did a good job and Kyle did a good job making sure that they followed through I think we brought this to their attention sometime last year so Kyle didn't let that just lay there uh talk to a couple of times and and out of the shoot I think the county did a good job of increasing and putting in a system that was better it's always good to do better so the problem is still there the Mr HK they showed us video which was pretty awesome every time there's a near miss the camera system takes a picture a video of that there are a lot of near misses making that leftand turn when there are two vehicles making the left hand turn there's a lot of variables that go into that I think the and we talked about this the spring break time of the year we have a lot of people down here that are not familiar with the traffic fls those are the people that don't realize that when two cars are making a leftand turn off of Boulevard on the causeway you have to go out and make effectively a 90\u00b0 turn if you start making less than that somebody's going to have an issue also we have the the fine folks that travel down from the north at that time of the year many of those drivers are not familiar with those those two have turns necessarily but it is just a matter of time now when the county made the recommendation of staying with the two lanes and Cy correct e they based that on traffic flow so they were looking to see how many vehicles are getting queued up since they made the changes with the new technology and that has improved immensely and that was my first issue when I was calling for the two lanes when cars have to sit there for a long period of time is not effective they in my opinion they fixed that problem which is great because you can see the flows going through it just doesn't queue up anymore which is awesome but the fact that we still have two lanes turning left and they recognize the fact that the merge distance is very short fact the bott's not going to go away and I hope we don't get in a scenario where and we all see this in life sometimes people are saying man that could be a problem that could be a problem and we wait until something catastrophic happens and then we say oh gosh we need to change that let's let's think this through and if it needs to be change one of the options can still be to turn that back to a single Lane and move it further back and take that um little island out um the county has assured me that we do take it out and for some particular reason we find out that it's not working as well as we thought they have no problem in putting it back but there is an option I believe still in coming back one single Lane and going through down through that b directional Lane to eliminate two vehicles turning left but just want to make sure everybody understands it is a big Improvement like K said the cars are not queueing up there because in the morning perfect example I've had citizens talk to me that when they first opened up that double turn line everything was set on a timer that was that was designed based on traffic flow now it's demand base which is Works terrific so if you come up here in the morning and and the cameras recognize there's nobody coming from Causeway and there's nobody coming from the south to the north it immediately changes back to green so that works great but I still think the issue when I sat there for just 5 minutes and saw those near misses what a lot of them uh and you don't really see if it's in the M because it shows you in that one interview we saw that it looks like they're going to hit and then it doesn't show you that anymore it just kind of goes out of the camera but it's something I think we need to discuss and make sure that that's taken care of my biggest concern is somebody actually walking on the sidewalk and those two cars battling for merged position and somebody gets pushed up on the sidewalk that's my biggest concern the speeds of the cars going is just going to be a couple of dents and somebody's going to be sad but if it goes up on that curve and hit somebody that won't be any fun you're also sharing those lenses with bers yes yes definitely definitely something we'll keep an eye on and yes council member thank you sir um to comment to E ases by go and I I feel vulnerable because there are many many times you sleep there and someone doesn't a lot of attention makes that it's so I think that up would be very help there is that I think when walk in that area I will not walk at that intersection because if you take a step off the curve um at go andway Crossing cross the back to the stre each access in that direction people come L around from and they can't see you and they come very quickly around that cor and that pedestrian in it's a better alternative and if I could also turn back to the stor project and I I want to thank you for all your collaboration and work on this to our neighbors very much and my thanks to our neighbors for um all their careful consideration of all of this when we look at the two options the two new options that you reviewed tonight the benefit of both of them is that in option one it literally is only going through grass and preserve the wonderful lios that we have along our eement the issue is that we have to have permission to encroach into that grass U but it's a very good option and it crosses the road it places the um the P station would be uh up on the protection pond near the pipe um where it goes into the soil but from there just be that 8 in so the pump that pump just the water over under the side be through the street out into the St okay yeah so it doesn't cross the road at all so um that option also brings potential cost savings because we're not disrupting the road you could address those a little bit as well as on option number two it did involve potentially crossing the road but it C noiss from anyone directly into the creek which is another good option for the water flow um but both options offer a pause on any further construction further on the street because the portion right out here um has good curve system the road is in very good shape um so we put a pause on any of that and and it might become permanent and therefore into the project yeah so the the both those options were important because what we're trying to do is get the current project down to the n9th street area to get those improvements done um and I was talking to Mr FL day about um getting with the contractor to um to stop um earlier on Harbor and just not do those proportions cuz that way we're not doing anything that we're going to tear up later so if we want to get that done we could we could build it off of the future project or leave it as is we'd still be able to get the uh 2f type great inlets in at this well um just not reservice the street right there until we know what we're doing that's we're keep you up up to dat with it any other questions or comments for the city manager uh so the we've released the RP for auditing Services um we got questions going to come in on May 14th and it's due May 31st um from there we'll call back the a committee to review um quickly the uh I have a the uh Florida City County Manager Association conference from May 29th to May 31st um I will be in Orlando but still working answering emails and um I don't know if anyone noticed but we did get the carpet changed out in this room um one thing we were not satisfied and and neither was the installer you can see some some seam lines so um the actual uh manufacturer came out and they're going to replace all it they weren't satisfied with the product either I mean it looks pretty good but it's not perfect when the sun catches it you do see some lines you're not supposed to see and they think it's just because um had a little bit thicker of a padding to it and the Machine that cut it just didn't cut it correctly so they're eventually going to be coming out to be that were to get out but we like we like it it looks nice but nice um and then lastly this month I'd like to um once I get my budget draft um just set up individual meetings to it virtually or in person just with each council member to to go through the first draft of the budget before we have our first um work work session good idea all right any other questions or comments you had enough anyway right good all right now we're on the item seven city clerk report R you have the floor just we've been working as business as usual I have nothing further to and you're doing a great job anyone have questions for the city court all right now we are on to the consent agenda items 8 and N this is for approval of the April 8th 2024 city council meeting minutes and the April 22nd 2024 city council work session minutes we'll have a motion to approve motion to approve consent agenda Asos motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second Roberts all in favor I any opposed right consent agenda passes now we're on to the regular agenda item 10 uh this is consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive uh financial report for fiscal year ending September 30th 2023 presented by Sal Marsh Cleveland and gun Certified Public Accounts welcome thank you good evening name is Chuck Landers I'm with Sal Mar Cleveland and gun and we've had the privilege of serving as the the city's Auditors for several years U with our predecessors before that tonight I'm going to present the annual comprehensive financial report not in detail but in summary I believe everybody's been given a copy at this point before getting started I definitely want to say thank you to Kyle for your assistance with the audit process there's no way we can do it without you and especially then Heather with test CPA I don't know if you all work with Heather very much oneon-one but she is a tremendous asset to the city very fortunate to have her in the uh packet of booklet that I should say turn to page one which is after all the Roman noals as you have to get through so it's about 10 or 11 pages in it's our lettered and this is the independent auditor report it's a multi-page report but I'm only going to read read the first two paragraphs these are the the ones that I would consider the most important out of these Pages these are the opinions paragraphs under the report on financial statements we have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities the business type activities each major fund and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city of Belair Beach Florida the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2023 and the related notes to the financial statements which collect ly comprise the city's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents this next paragraph is is the important one in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the respective financial position of the governmental activities the business type activities each major fund and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund of the city as of and for the year ended September 30th 2023 and the respect of changes in financial position and where applicable cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that's what's called an unmodified opinion it's the clean opinion it's the uh the best that we can give and the best that you can receive the next several pages are the basic financial statements and the notes I'm not going to go through these in detail like I said but there are a few that I'll just point out if you don't mind following along with me on page 17 Page 17 is What's called the statement of net position this shows the assets and the liabilities and the net position of the city as of September 30th 2023 this is a snapshot the numbers were different the day the day before they were different the day after but it's what they look like on this day I'm again I'm on page 17 the statement of net position just above the middle half of the page you see total assets 24,32 2,000 in the far right column so you have the governmental activities in the in the middle column the business type activities uh next to that and then the total column again 24.3 million total assets total liabilities jumping down towards the bottom of the page 3.8 almost 3.9 million which leaves net position of 20,44 7,000 of which 10.9 million you all have invested in your Capital assets leaving 9.5 million as unrestricted very healthy the uh net position I Comm you for that so again that's page 17 the sa the net position the next page page 18 this is the the statement of activities and this attempts to show the the expenses and the revenue and then x uh Revenue again it's in my in my uh opinion this is a confusing statement to look at so I'm not going to take you through this instead if we turn to page 21 I believe this is a a a more readable format to follow and go through Page 21 this is the statement of revenues and expenditures and changes in fund balance for the governmental funds we'll see that there's a column for the general fund and a column for the capital projects fund a third of the way down the page total revenues 3.3 million for the general fund a little over 2 million for the capital projects fund for total governmental revenues of 5.3 almost 5.4 million the middle third of the page shows the expenditures total expenditures for the general fund a little over 2 million capital projects fund just under 2.2 million for Combined of 4.2 4, 250,000 roughly in expenditures for the two funds then the bottom third of the page you see these are other financing sources and uses the general fund did transfer 1.1 million to the capital projects fund but overall the net other financing sources was 381,000 which consisted of debt proceeds if you're looking at this from a business perspective this would be roughly what net income would be so in the in the general fund you see net change in fund balance a positive 173,000 for the capital projects fund a positive balance positive increase of 1, 335,000 for a combined 1, 159,000 increases all across the board if you turn to page 25 page 25 is the statement of revenues and expenses and changes in net position for the proprietary funds these are your business type funds you have the storm water fund and the marina fund what are the two funds that the city operates again this is looking at the revenues and the expenses the revenues for the storm water fund 975,000 the marina fund 78,000 for a combined mil 53,000 their expenditures 232,000 for the storm water fund 75,000 almost 76,000 for the marina fund for Combined 308,000 what does that yield that yields a net increase in net position of 74300 roughly for the storm water fund $3,000 for the marina fund combined 745,000 so again positive net increases across the two funds and in total the next several Pages there there's some more statements but then you get into the notes the financial statements there's only just a few notes I want to point out if you turn to page 44 page 44 at the top of page 44 this is note for and the reason I point this out is U this is concerning the receivables of the city so money that's owed to the city in the general fund the accounts receivable 334 for almost 335,000 and underneath the the um chart that you see there I'm just going to read this this one paragraph This is on page 44 it's note for accounts receivable accounts receivable for the general fund include $282,300 will be fully collectible therefore the city has not recorded an allowance as of September 30th 2023 that's just a little unique to what you all have in the city so that's why I point that out as a note disclosure for you the next note disclosure I would point out is on page 45 sorry 46 46 is note 9 the bottom of the page these are the non-current liabilities of the city this lists the the loans the bonds and the compensated absences the top half of the the table are the governmental activities at the end of the year there were 1 million 93,000 of non-current liabilities we call longterm and then underneath that the business type activities they have long-term or non-current liabilities of 1.7 million so again just pointing out what the the liabilities are for the city now we're going to jump almost to the very end page 86 under governmental Audits and standards we're required to issue a few more reports on page 86 is what's called The Independent auditor report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards lots of words on this page the middle section of this page is called internal control over financial reporting it describes what a material weakness is and what a significant efficiency is I'm going to jump the next to the last sentence on this page it says in part during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses that's part of that page you want to know if you turn to the next page the top of the page is on page 87 the compliance in other matters last sentence in that top paragraph the results of our test disclose no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government Audits and standards again I would consider that to be the important sentence on that page the next page is the beginning of the management letter the management letter is presenting information that is required uh some more specifically for the State of Florida there's one section that I do need to point out uh it's the very last section not last on the last paragraph on page 89 so the second page of this letter so this is the addition additional matters paragraph So it's it's this is just additional matters I'll just read it section 10554 one I3 rules of the auditor general requires us to communicate non-compliance with provisions of contracts or Grant agreements or abuse that have occurred or likely to have occurred that have an effect on the financial statements that is less than material again I want to point out that is less than material but warrants the attention of those charged with governance City Council in connection with our audit we noted the following control deficiencies during testing over the city's dispersements it was noticed six out of the 15 vendors tested that were issued material payments during the fiscal year were not registered with E verifi the city entered into a contract with one vendor which explicitly listed terms related to E verifi this vendor also does not appear to be enrolled and E verifi and is not registered as an active entity on the Florida Department of State website Sun this.org so just a little little more background there we're not saying that this is a a material problem it's just something that came up during our testing we've discussed it with Kyle uh the the vendor in question I believe uh you all are working out uh to make sure that you get the the contracts the the name of the contract correct or the name in the contract correct and um that if they would need to be issued to $199 that you take care of that as well so just again not a material item but it's something that came up in our testing so we need to present that to you and then the very last thing on page 91 this is the independent accountant report on compliance with Section 28415 FL statutes section 28415 FL of statutes is concerning the investment of public funds during the year into September 30th 2023 and the next to the last paragraph on this page says in our opinion the city of belir Beach Florida complied in all material respects with the AFF mentioned requirements for the year ended September 30th 2023 that concludes presentation welcome any questions thank you very much Mr Landers um do we have any questions that we would like to ask yes sir so everything there seemed very very positive with the exception of as you reference on page 89 is anything that you can recommend that we can do so that we don't have a scenario where some of the vendors that we contract B are not registered with e sure absolutely u i I would recommend as you on board a new vendor or or engage in business with them uh make sure that you get a u the W I want say before I'm not sure if that's the right number at this point got taxes going through my head also but but um W9 I believe is the cor form uh so you get their full name uh their their the type of entity that they are and their EIN number and then uh just check it uh again before uh activating a new a new vendor check sunbiz make sure that they are registered and that they're an active in the State of Florida if they require some type of professional license look at that or CPA firm you can check my name and our firm to make sure that we're properly licensed as well just a little bit due diligence at the beginning I think would do good all right thank you other questions comments all right um let's go to the citizens for comments thank you thank you very much would any citizen like to make comments on this report before I uh ask for a motion to approve this to accept this report see if thbs up everybody okay all right

city and welcome to planning and Z all right we are on to the mysterious item number 12 it helps when your flass drive is fully engaged it was all CR it was just the strangest thing okay uh so um this is for consideration of ordinates 24-02 Mr MOA would you please read the ordinance then provide a brief summary of what it all means happily Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 24-02 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances so Part B Land Development code 4 zoning Article 1 in general section 942 definitions to amend the definition of substantial Improvement to reduce the look back period from substantial Improvement calculations down from 5 years to one year and amending Article 5 supplementary District regulations Division 1 generally section 24 94255 alterations improvements and repairs to align with flood plane ordinance requirements providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for severability and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance number 24-02 by title only the first reading Mr Mayor uh this is um again in the spirit of the um Land Development code review that this Council has undertaken we are we are implementing those amendments that can the city does not deem to be more burdensome or restrictive but rather less burdensome or restrictive U pursuant to the restrictions of Senate Bill 250 or 280 sorry I think it's Senate Bill 250 um adopted during the 2023 legislative session uh in this this amendment what we're doing and you can see the the the 5year calculation actually comes from the definition of substantial Improvement in your code it's a little hard to see because we do everything through strike through and underline but if you're looking at the definition uh on page 204 for this ordinance where it says substantial Improvement definition towards the right on the second line and also the like seventh line you can see five year has been strien out and one year has been underlined and that's that's substantively where that definition and guidance comes for your administrators in your code so we're changing the substantial Improvement calculus to be a oneyear look back as opposed to a 5-year look back um and then also because this is a a consonant Amendment um or consistent Amendment as far as being related to female regulations and this is also came at the um encouragement of Mr Sara and and with the manager's review where where it provides under the remodeling language it says um presently it says any application for which the total value exceeds a certain dollar threshold 20,000 shall be required to have a certified appraisal we've removed that requirement to say market value shall be determined as defined in section 74134 and second section 74134 sets forth a few options for that appraisal not limited U or for that um valuation not limited to a certified appraisal and so that's what we're doing there again making it less restrictive not enhancing the requirements and so those are these two amendments again these have been discussed previously in the abstract during your code review and this is the ordinance implementing them on first reading we'll still have to do a second reading where this to pass tonight thank you Mr MOA before we take this to the council opening for citizen comment yes sir please come right on John Hy 22 stre is not so much a comment it's more of a question the City attorney referenced a a Senate Bill 280 so the we're being forced to reduce the look back based on a state law that I'm assuming has already been signed in at law I'm just trying to get a little clarification and then something about new F Maps so that's all thrown into this I'm trying to better understand it we go to uh uh Council discussion I'm sure someone will try to uh make bring light to this okay thank you you any other questions or comments by the council Citi comments are closed Council uh I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 24-02 mayor I would like the great honor of moving that this ordinance be okay I'm going to give that to council member Elliot do I have a second second second five Frank than yes sir if I may just to inform the dialogue of the council address the inquiry that was posed based on my comment um from the from the member of the public um the during my during my opening explanation I referenced Senate Bill 250 uh during the 2023 not this legislative session but the last what that that bill did was it was passed um post Ian and Nicole and provided that within nowhere within 100 miles of landfall of those storms of which Beller Beach is within 100 miles of landfall of those storms and again landfall might multiple places but be that as make um you cannot adopt any land restrict Land Development code provision that is more burdensome or restrictive and so as we have done our Land Development code review some things we've said hey maybe we need to tighten this or make this a little more restrictive these are not those as it relates to changing the look back from 5 years to one year that's a legislative decision that this body has made based on input from its residents um the study that the that the student had presented and other other legislative inputs that each of you individually consider this is not a mandate this is legislative discretion being exercised um in terms of changing the look back period from 5 Year to one year and all the U Benchmark comparisons you've done so that's why we're here I just want to be clear this is not pursued to amending thank you um council member ellot you have the Flor um we want to thank our mayor for bringing this to um a quick resolution as we have reviewed our set of ordinances but this is ibe just pull it a little closer to you have a feeling can't hear out there got to get on on record also but we want to thank our mayor for bringing this issue up as we reviewing our ordinances and we were looking for improvements this is something certainly that the city has struggled with for a long time our citizens have struggled with this there is no requirement anywhere in other statutes or regulations that would requiry here put back uh we support Bea's rules in terms of trying to provide for good uh flood management um but there's no purpose to a fiveyear look back and certainly support having a oneyear look back thank you very much uh other comments yeah I I think the important issue here is the only negative part of 5 years to one years we have M permits come in rather than uh waiting 5 years and I don't think probably 9 to 10% of the citizens understand say when you buy a house and someone did a lot of repairs to the house that you bought that gets taxed onto that 5year look back if it was staying at 5 years so if your house is a phras let's say this is fous structure of the house it's not your entire property it's just the structure of your house so if your house is at $300,000 a praise you can only do $150,000 in repairs modification substantial so some people put new windows in put a roof on you could have $75,000 tied up and you didn't even know when you purchase the house wh a hurricane comes you got $80,000 in repairs the county will tell you to tear the house down all right because you're over that $150,000 and we had a resident that beat up one Kyle K didn't do anything but follow the code okay to the letter of the law in fact he tried out a million times we in the county said tough it was over what 101,000 yeah I me we grossly calulated it when it was and and she's still out of it she's still out of their own I mean it's just it's it's a horrible situation and reducing this now to one year is is really just common sense thank you Mr Baker all right I uh I do think that this is a good good thing for our city it's uh it's also uh going to help us maintain the character that we love about Belair Beach it's going to help us keep our homes um in the spirit of small Hometown Community beach front Community uh that uh that brought us all here so it's not going to solve The World's problems I thought that zero was maybe uh too little and uh could be problematic in the future and it might actually put us on someone's radar so I think one year is uh is appropriate and I think in the long run this is this the right way to go so we would like to vote on this now all right if you mind calling the RO please council member Banker yes council member Roberts hi council member Elliot hi mayor gtis hi all right so the ordinance passes unanimously and we will vote again on this next month thank you everyone for uh working so hard on this I'd also like to thank Planning and Zoning taking a look at this all right now we're on to item number 13 consideration of ordinance 24-3 Mr Mor you're thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 24-3 an ordinance of the city Council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subp Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 4 districts division fre residential low RL District 2 Section 94220 minimum living areas and setbacks to reduce the side setback for specified Lots in Beller Beach first subdivision providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading award that's number 2403 by title uh as you can see here again in the strike through an underl line on page two of three for this ordinance page 147 of the PDF the um lot change here is on the Lots one two and three row that is the second or the first substantive row of numbers in that table there on the side set back you see we're reducing the side setback from 15 to 7 which is why it is not more burdensome or restrictive it is reducing the setback and that's to make it consistent with other side setbacks you see such as in units a c e and D in the area um this was presented initially by a particular property owner again we're not zoning to a specific property owner but rather to Lots 1 two and three because your Land Development code has different side setbacks based on platted Lots it's that's done in this format um so we're keeping the format just changing one little line here from 15t back set back to seven and um if there's any more specific inquiries I think Kyle can provide rather manager refer and provide additional detail of pp but that's the proposed ordinance as with the last ordinance you have the business impact estimate as required by um otherwise if it pass tonight this will pass this will have to pass on a second reading at a later dat thank you Mr MOA before we uh go into discussion you have any citizen comments yes sir Mr yes sir please come up and give us your name and address please hi my name is Scott Brown uh address is 907 harbard Drive I am lot one of uh this area and I just wanted to introduce myself and uh express my support for the change I understand this is the first reading and there's a second reading next month I'm going to be out of town for that reading I just didn't want it to appear that I wasn't interested I'm very interested and uh so I won't be here for a second but uh I do support and hope passes thank you Mr Brown appreciate your comments Mr transy John hansing 22nd Street I did my homework on this one I I found the code and these setbacks that are referenced my problem with this is you're going to go from 15 ft setback or on the side to 7t and yet we have people who complain about flooding basically in Lake terms if you go down to 7 ft for a side setback that means somebody can build a house within 7t of his property line 7t in the other property line you still got the 15 ft I I checked mine too so I'm moving at this and I'm thinking we're going to put more stuff on the ground where rain isn't going to be absorbed or be able to run off and create more flooding I really don't understand what the point is but given the fact that we have issues with flooding and now we're trying to figure out where we're going to put Pump Station at the South End of the city and we do get Flooding at the North End I'm opposed to this for the simple fact run off from rain we haven't had a bad storm yet but the last one that came through last year while I was out of town my rain gauge only had 3 and 1/2 in from that total storm cuz I use that to monitor what I need to do irrigation but I'm not for that to that simple reason you got to have more porest land to absorb the water thank you Mr Andy any other citizen comments Council I made a motion to approve ordinance 24-3 I have a motion Some Mo motion made by council member Elliott do I have a second a second second by council member Banker council member Elliot you have the floor um I just wanted to respond to to our citizen that the this particular change affects literally only three lots in the city um and houses I believe are already on these lots and um I think it is a change to make things consistent among our homeowners throughout the city and I supp thank you other comments or questions I was under the same impression you on this and any new construction 10 10 foot above sea Lev 100K most people don't 14t now 500 Mar so it still does reduce the drainage depending on how much concrete I do have a problem with that um but again this is this is really s specific if I'm wrong it's one lot the uh Lots three and four are all Bas side part okay because I can support that but I I sympathize with citizens if we're trying to do that we do have an impervious surface ratio that every lot has to follow that plays into that Roberts Kyle do we know why it was ever initially do we know why it was initially 15 Fe was there a specific reason for that that anybody knows the history of I think originally one investment company owned all of lots um before we got the uh Community Trust Grant um where we got money from federal government to purchase the three lots for a park okay um I I don't know that far back okay the 15 it is the only 15t side setback the largest side set back rest of the city is 10 ft um and that's on the North End there's not one side set back that is um 10 ft on the C so it does match all the b beach um units a c d e and D on South okay so I should have checked this myself so is that lot currently built on yes so houses already there yes okay so this unless you was down and rebuild the house this allows him to have um I don't know if you want to place a shed or some kind of covering off of his house it allows him to get a little closer toide property line right than he normally go we have a map of that area that you could project yeah I just it's the house next to the so yeah it's 97 Harbor so as you can see he's got 15 ft which is a pretty big you can't see the next to it so the planning planning and zoning board made this recommendation as well did did you have to go out work with them and presented them already yes no I I didn't I met with Kyle had a discussion with Kyle that made the request cuz I it really was a question why is my lot the only lot in the entire city of beach that has a 15t setback and literally is he looked it he couldn't believe it either it's the only house that has a 15t setback okay so I de said we make it the same as the rest of the city okay what is the size of a lot in relations to the others Mr Roberts more to your inquiry just as a point of educational this in terms of what we're doing here it's a a legislative change not a VAR and so the the gentleman or a property owner in a similar position would not ordinarily go before planning its Z Bo beyond the same interest he has here as a member to comment on it it's not an application for Relief that he's seeking it's a just a legislative policy I just while we've got the down time G the opportunity just clarify that difference thanks so you can see the DI Manion a lot on the same most lots are about 110 ft it's 11 114 on the other and it's close to 100 wide on the front and 110 on the back um if you look at some of these other houses they're not quite the same size lot you can see that they all have a little bit smaller setbacks build closer to the property M do you think that the uh setback was was put in place to prevent building bigger hard say I mean you can Union two lots and and build a big house if you got two two lots next to each other we have larger size Lots you go the north into the city that might be the largest lot in the South but as you can see with some of these houses you know this be the biggest in the city and what is the uh issue in that area I mean I don't have the exact square footage of what uh difference that setback would make but like I said the The appro Sur surface ratio of 65 is going to apply to every lot so regardless the size it's the same ratio so not sure why we would you know he still held to the same standards okay I might point out also that this lot is Waterfront as well as adjoining a cre and that many of the improvements that are there are permeable services so the P are notable so I for one am very concerned about flooding but I don't think this one that is contributing significantly to it where we do have the flooding however is in front of that house joining house where the storm water drain is and that's what project is about in the part is this flooding goes from front of that in the street backing up the street into the other all right thank you any other comments all right well just let take it to the vote Rene would you please call the RO council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliott I mayor gtis I all right so that ordinance passes we'll vote again on it next month now we're on to item number 14 consideration of ordinance 24-4 Mr Mora you please read the ordinance and give us a free Happ one moment please this is ordinance number 24-4 an ordinance of the city council the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances sub Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning section 94-72 fences and section 94251 fences walls and hedges to allow for fences walls or Hedges on seaw wall caps providing for implementation providing for resolution conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective dat this has been a first reading ordinance number 24-4 by title only and again um turning to substantively you're amending two sections so that they're consistent with each other but both of these um involve allowing for um fence so you can see on page 206 the second paragraph 94-72 subb the language is changed now so that fence shall also be permitted on but not Beyond The Waterfront facing side of the seall cap to a height of 48 in uh there was some discussion at work sessions about this desire especially when you consider pets and other small children who might go across such caps and why those things may wish to be extended that was some of the your discourse on that again this is a policy decision for you and then in 94251 fences walls and hedges uh you can see in sub two there's been language added to say fences walls and hedges shall be permitted on not placed Beyond or overgrowing the Waterfront facing side of the seawall cap so if you want to use the dimensions of your Seawall cap you can this does not give you license to out or have has Rel solid fence that extends you know several inches beyond your seaw wall line or otherwise you wanted to be flush with your seall cap to cover that space you do so should this amendment be adopted and that's Lage you have this is a longer Amendment only because I included the entirety of section 94251 um section all the subsections the only subsection being amended substance subsection two that stands Pages two and three of six of this or p 153 or 152 and 153 of the PF if you're track that so um there's a bunch of other numbers after there that's just for completeness so it's there's no mystery as to what the rest of that section States um otherwise it pass tonight as we go to a second for your thank you Mr Mora let's go to the citizens for comments anyone like to comment on this forance all right C comments are closed need a motion to approve ordinance 24-4 so moov motion made by council member Roberts do I have a second Mr Roberts you have the floor I just think it makes sense I don't think it's it's a big deal but um I think it makes sense as um Mr moris said briefly when he was doing that that um and there are some issues with kids being on it that type of thing so it makes sense to be able to be able to put a fence um you know the conventions did not change so it's not like the neighbor is going to be obstructed now because of this change I think it makes sense thank you Mr Roberts any other comments my question about this is um whether the Integrity of the would be protected they that someone put a fence there have to drill into it somehow fix the fence and how the I have a neighbor who just installed a new fence and I fully understood theod um so it does extend a little further over the cab than stopping before um but the post that holds the entire fence in place is ground not in the sea um as far as the purpose for this everybody's got a dog in this city and if you don't block that sea wall or a seap they're going to snake around they're going to come into your yard or you're going to be piling up like I did for years bricks and blocks and everything else that's falling into the uh into the water and it just looks awful I I see nothing wrong with this I think it's a good idea any other questions or comments no all right let's take it to a vote council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot I mayor gtis I so that one passes unanimously and we will vote on this one again next month all right item number 15 this is for consideration uh authorizing a purchase order for Engineering Services to replace the South Park seaw wall Mr thank you Mar so after we completed 7th Street Park and 16th Street Park SE walls um South Park was the next one on the list um I included some pictures it's very obvious um it's a very old seaw wall it's got a lot of sping a lot of cracking um mostly failure um but you know at each joint of the concrete slabs it's separating um so we uh have been budgeting money to replace our seaw walls and U this has been on the corrective action list for the par Recreation board um for two years now so it's been noticed and um this would be to um start the design um to go go up the bid to get the seaw wall replaced thank you Mr reefer let's go to Citizens for comments anyone like to speak on this topic Cen comments are closed Council I need a motion to authorize a purchase order for Engineering Services to replace the South Park sea wall motion made by council member OT have second I'll give that one to Mr rer M Elliot you have the floor perfectly sensible we need to maintain our sea walls so this part of that process thank you um I have a question um just because I don't know what the real difference is between City owned piece of property versus private property but generally well in fact as you know I'm working on getting a new SE now um I just hired one company we get it all um is there a specific reason why we have to do Engineering Services with one company to hand the project off to another company that might have done that anyway um mainly because and um attorning more from ra it's mainly because we need to have the plans so that we can because of the price of the project we know that it's going to be something that needs to be bed out um so it's to get that um all the you know plan design done so then when we we release the bid um we have all that taken care of and then any company that comes and replaces seaw walls can use that um PR B so it's perfectly specked out of how it's going to be done yes and then every uh bidder of he save his ey to bid on so that it's there it's uh it just seems a little shocking to me that it cost 6,000 bucks to go yeah you need a SE w and and it's going to look the same no matter whose it is this does um you know this does include the um the engineers coming out up to three site visits um to do the inspecting on top of what the county will already do it was part of the pering process so it's actually a little it's a little extra um being his public property um May you shouldn't that's fine that's fine I was just just just curious there are there are multiple ways Mr Mayor to to get construction projects done kind you did basically like a design Bild so you find one firm who does both of those where you do a hard bid you design it with company a and then did it down to multiple constructions there's three or four other ones you can use but a simple thing like this uh isn't the way the way our city managers doing makes some sense all right thank you very much any other comments no all right well let's take it to we'll just do a voice on this one all in favor I any oppos all right Mr you are authorized toce than sir unfinished business we have any unfinished business all right uh let's see here now we're on few Council comments we're going to start with council member OT this mon I don't have a whole lot to say I think we've accomplished a lot over the last month we've gotten great input from our citizenry and I think we've reached some good decision so a good night I agree uh Mr Roberts I do have something to say about the way I didn't have a good feeling or taste regarding how we handled the three citizens who step forward after we were um really trying to get citizens to step forward to join the council so I'm concerned that in the future when we try to do something like that again that we may have people that saw that and witnessed that and saw what happened and may deter other citizens from stepping forward so it just bothered me so I just wanted to talk about it a little bit and say I hope that if we decide to proceed and bring on an additional council member or three that other people will understand what we did and not be deterred from stepping up because I still think and I think we all agree that we'll probably need at least one more council member to be up here with us and we're not saying necessarily that the three that applied earlier are done I don't believe so I just wanted to to voice my opinion on that because if I were in their shoes and they did all the things that they did to step up and say Hey I want to be on on the city's Council I think I'd bring something to the table and nothing happened I may not be too happy about that so I just want too thank you very much Mr Banker you're up I would to take's time um last month I went to the B Shores be because I spoke to sheriff about b beach resence from Bui Beach being moved on beaches Shores laying out just sitting in a chair the sheriff nity would inform his deputies that they should not move people sitting or lying on the beach simply there is no certified ID actually in the area no certified or control line either the only true Mark is a construction line by female which is the sea wall the properties in that area I do want to stress that this should be in no way telling anyone to encroach themselves as close as possible proper our this was further noted by the sheriff's at that meeting also noted at the meeting was two complaints about be of Shores one of the complaints is from commissioner stories who took out C nots on his property lives all the way in the South End of the Val Shores although I seen pictures of our R and truly that's not the case the rap War were many feet away from the ceilings of this problem another complaint from short was that the bottle fell out of the ring the r period and was left just a note me and his Council woman did Beach clean up Saturday and there was what six or seven P bottles sou by some chairs our short that I guess people were just faring that night just said we just leave here so anyway so also also noted at that meeting was AAL b beach will be compensated B shes for any legal action they saw in their March letter to b beach that was followed by one of the Commissioners possibly sugges removing the parking in the Lots dedicated to the b beach I know during citizens comments if that was the wishes of the Commissioners I would contact American Disability associate and get their in me was also noted for Citizens as B 2201 was addressed last year by a resent b beach to sum up this ordinance it allows belir Shores residents to erect temp temporary structures of shade Etc anywhere and leave on noted beaches while prohibiting resents of b beach Etc the same simply ordinance 2201 I believe as account violates the federal Florida equal protection after the meeting I was thanked by all the Commissioners for my input I had a long talk with commissioners who also lives at the First Southern House of Shores this property is adjacent to the IRB 28 Street Jackson I told commission story that dollar Beach residents are not the problems most are simpe to Dollar shes issues although we need to work together I further note that the resent that brought up the 20 20 20221 ordinance is serious about filing F wall ERS attorney needs to contact him sooner than later I also emailed B shes attorney the next day emphasizing this and the B shes was upset with legal cost in the other lawsuit a federal one might not might not be covered under their insurance and please seek out the resid to avoid litigation I further sent a text to commissioner story in this regard simply I've have not heard back since I sent this email I further not all this Mr Mo this past week H he could motivate the counsel taking know as a councilman like my colleagues who play a of federal state constitution B shes refuses to rectify 2201 I comp of any I that more their Council and their commission to look at that ordinance and work with thank you Mr Banker on that note would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn motion motion made by V again do I have a second second second
