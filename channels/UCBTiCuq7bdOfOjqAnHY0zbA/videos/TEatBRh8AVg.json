    "transcript": "you have to maintain you have to maintain some type of relation yes if you're if you're fishing from the beaches you're still required to have salt fishing I think a lot of people come down the weekend or whatever it's very cheap to get it it is especially if it's just a temporary one like they're here on vacation they can go to Walmart they can go to almost just about any onl go online there's several different ways they can get it they're very they have so they're inord are they ever checked you guys ever checked the Yes actually what was brought up before with some of the saltwater Fisheries violations and stuff our marine unit will go out they'll they'll hit the beaches once in a while they'll hit the uh Bridges they're not always on boats they may be in their trucks or however that's why uh the sergeant said they'll stop by underneath the bridges they'll catch or catch it's a bad word but they'll make Conta with several citizens and they'll check for illegal fish illegal sizes make sure they have their uh their licenses and everything too so that may be exactly what was brought up in the last session thank I I can add one thing to uh in reference to the boat that is out there the sailboat it has been taged by our Marin as a der vess the process is not overnight the cases have to go on for 21 days once the case is finished and they have deemed it as a d vessel and they've not been able to make contact with the owners or dealing with it in any different way then the boat would be deemed steric and we can remove it then the next process is getting the contracting company out there in order to remove it so they try they're trying to keep it within the time Lim roughly that 21 to 30 days to have it out of there but I do know that actually has been down believe the county is that right as far as the removal of the boats some of it is count but some of it they get through state grants also uh FWC actually puts out a lot of the grants in order to get a lot of these votes removed so it's a combination of very good any other questions um you know I'm I'm guessing that this list is very short because either one is hot or two they they heard the arbitrary new share of well I don't know but we did I mean like I said I've been work with Kyle and everything we've been looking and trying to stay on top of everything and we just it's been a slower month as far as some PL of problems or issues this has been one of the shortest lists I've seen yet why don't you just well Okay I uh yeah cuz when I come out here uh I try to even on the days that I'll hit the beach I try to get up and down every single Street in the city every day that I'm out here and you know double check that first before we even do any course or anything so it's just been good seems to be working I'm glad you're here just one other positive comment I noticed at the house on 21st Street I guess it's in ownership transition but it has been cleaned up right which is I I stopped by I talked to one of the workers there who is actually a friend of the um I guess new owners if you want to put it that way and uh he was actually starting to work on the inside of course they had a mess inside I guess so um it was terrible but at least you know right off the bat they got the front cleaned up and the yard cleaned up and everything else so it is going better thank you any other questions or comments TR all right thank you very much sir thank you sir okay Mr Mora thank you Mr Mayor um happy report as far as we know it's safe Memorial Day here in the city um over the past month I've done uh some presentations for the Florida Association of Code Enforcement I was just at the um fccma conference that uh Kyle was attending speaking on some new legislation that's been adopted relative to unsheltered persons got a presentation this coming weekend with the Institute of elected Municipal officials especially for some of our newer officials always a resource to consider um with the FL Lea City's University um I'll also be presenting at the Florida Planning and Zoning Association this week um getting back to things inside the city we though we are in June nearly 3 months post session there are still bills that have not been signed uh we continue to track them closely um I think about eight bills got signed uh just in the last week but for example bills that are being held near and dear to the pel speeches such as the short-term rental Bill still has not been sent to the governor for Signature uh as a reminder that process is that once it passes those chambers of leg of the legislature in identical form it has to be sent to the governor the governor has 15 days to sign any legislation sent to him um if not signed in those 15 days it passes as far as bills that have been sent in there are dozens um all the two have signed only two have been vetoed by the governor so we'll see where what that means for the remaining uh bills that are coming forward there is no set deadline by which a bill has to be at least not the Florida Constitution by which bills have to be transmitted to the governor so we await that um as far as legislative happenings in this community we are approaching budget season and I'm sure the manager will be speaking to that um shortly um for our newer members uh the budget has to be adopted by October 1st each year the only legislative acts you have to do uh annually so we'll be beginning that process um and um uh more recently as far as other happenings in the community I did have a meeting about two weeks ago with member bankard and a member of the community Mr Mano concerning the Beller Beach and Beller Shore um exchanges relating to the beaches and their uses two real issues going on there one the interlocal agreement and the second issue being concerned of some residents related to their ability to use the wet sand beaches in the same manner as the members of fell at Shore um very productive discussion uh informative and I continue to move forward I am in weekly contact with the town attorney for the town of B Shore and making progress on items both related to the interlocal agreement and just general as getting getting better acquainted as we work together as neighboring jurisdictions um outside of that uh the one other thing I would add since especially Rob mentioned it earlier there is a property I believe it's 107 21st Street is the is the address that um has recently come into compliance that is a function of a change if not in ownership certainly in possession of the property and then investment uh investor style approach that has brought the property um into compliance on the exterior they are looking to um sell the property continue to enhance the exterior Landscaping Etc I believe they're targeting a sale within the next week or two for continued compliance as part of that they have approached the manager and myself um a representative from the property has approached the manager myself would request that this commission consider U reducing the fines or otherwise eliminating the fines on the property given the expedience with which they work with this so it's a request I think there's a representative of that property here now that seems they may have exited the room at the moment as I looked down at my notes um so I'm not sure they're in the room at the moment um but not something that's formally on the agenda tonight but it was something that was asked of us to make you aware of in these hearings we could if you wish to discuss it this evening as a commission you could do as a council you could do so during other or unfinished business but it was not an agendized item um for purposes of the record we did receive um correspondence as I was um traveling to the hearing I think that gentleman just reentered the room um but I did uh receive correspondence from that property owner from a representative of that property saying hope this email finds you well as you know this office has been working for the property owner uh uh in order to deal with the open code violations and fines we've made significant process progress dealing with these violations in fact it appears all violations have been resolved and the manager confirmed that they're in compliance presently so the F should cease we promptly assisted the owner who was unable to act on her own behalf and took all necessary steps to address these open issues we acknowledge the vi occurred over an extended period resulting in a formal invoice exceeding $50,000 in fines however since we were not in a position to address these fines we respectfully request these penalties be waved relatedly we are also going to improve the appearance of the outside of the property with landscaping and other improvements with a view of listing the property over the next few weeks at a full fair market value we look forward to your response thank you in advance for your professional courtesy again though not necessarily part of my report given that I think the member of the public who intended to raise this entered the room for public comment and ceas I wanted to make sure you were aware of that as it relates to B compliance uh and so those are that's all that spits print in my report Mr Mayor and I'm happy to answer any questions from the council Council I just want to thank you than any other questions or comments from the city attorney thank you Mr I do wish to make one note because I just can't resist Mr Mayor there are two very very engaged uh members of the public here in the back row my children are in attendance tonight and I'd be remissed if I missed the opportunity as a father to embarrass the public summer homework what brother knock out all right up next is the city manager report Mr Reaper thank you mayor I'm start off the top was work down um we have the go Boulevard undergrounding project I'm happy to say after we did the pay back agreement for the Spectrum conduit that is more than halfway done and at this point they feel U they could be wired um and Dro down from the aerial po to underground with at the end of September so that's moving along hopefully there's no delays on that um the next uh is our strong water Improvement project um currently we got the streets that have been started uh doing the curb replacement Morgan Drive 25th through 23rd and they're currently down at Cedar spr and palm next to the building um right now those are to be the first streets that will be um asphalted resurfaced and um restored um and the schedule for that is late June at this point the um we're currently you know part of what the resident SP forgive me if I say his name incorrect I think it's um he lives at the corner of 23rd in G Boulevard um we've met with him several times the last time I spoke with him about this issue um was the Friday before last and um being out of town this past Friday when typically we do our on-site meetings um as my understand that uh city engineer floody had talked to him and um has talked to the contractor um some was concerned is that there is a negative pitch which we can have um starting from in driveway going towards a depression at the corner of 2030 gol Boulevard um the layout of the street is it by the sidewalk on G where the radius is it is very low um it over the years has puddled and left sediment build up even growing weeds um that scope of the road is actually pelis County right away and looking at it um we think the best ad approach is to start at a high point um right at the very beginning of where uh you know it be just east of the sidewalk in Boulevard and then you know continue our uh continuous um you know slope all the way down the bore uh Drive um but at that one spot it has to come back down to the depression that exists in gol Boulevard but we didn't want to match starting at where that Depression was because our plan is that the county does something to their Road um and reshaping it to meet where our high point is at the start of 23rd um I'm not sure if I summed up everything but I do know that the major concern was the depression or sorry the negative flow that was heading um on the new curb and what I've told uh the resident was that our main goal is to have the water flow to the East Bay Shore Drive um one way or the other um um where there's new curve to make sure it gets down to the end of the road we have other issues at bore um which our Engineers U droing up an explanation that when we get to bore in a future project um the idea is we're going to have to probably lower the inlets on mayore and maybe even add an additional Inlet and some problem areas um to get that water to continue and get off and down the drain um but we are look at as a as a whole um you know including gol Boulevard and the streets we're currently working on and in the future project um there's a lot of areas of the curb that the profile is not your typical v-shaped ballet curb it's very flat um we've seen this in other areas of the city before um not fully understanding why it was flat and I can't speak exactly to those areas because we do want to um when we get down to for example 19th we want to at again the total fall of the road we want to maintain a continuous flow line and we have the water flow to the east um but at the same time we you know given that uh there is no ballot there's no actual b shape in the curb we are uh verifying that the water does flow um the concern is and again I'm going to uh we're working on cost estimates what it would take um as far as additional asphalt and raising driveways um to create a vshape in the curve um but in looking at it the to meet objective number one which is to get the water of the flow and stay out of the road we feel we're meeting that um with the curve that is installed even though it is not you know the perfect specification for a valley curve um so that is another concern but like I said we are um working on a report that I will share with you so that there's a full understanding of what we're doing out there before we get to the Asal portion of the project um I think I might have covered it I know you know based on a diagram I sent it to Mr FL today I said this is basically what you've reiterated in your email to me and he said yes and you know we we'll keep doing it until it's right so just know we've been out there working on it um I'm sure we'll be meeting on it in the future um and then the other portion that was brought up was 22nd Street we did not have the curves getting replaced for the extent of that street uh because it was resurfaced in the past two to three years uh one of the residents on that street uh contacted me and told me that the previous city manager told him that those curves were getting replaced um so after hearing that uh it's not the ideal way to replace a curve but it could be done so we do have the engineer looking at it um two cut out areas of broken curb um where you're puddling and then you know replacing that we're going to get a proposal together for you to look at and consider does this begin ATL gol um down to the four-way when we were designing the project we did um include the radiuses of the four-way stop because there there's a lot of puddling that's historically been there so that was included in the project but not the the whole 22nd Street curve um that is all I have um did did I address all of your concerns just want to how in of my property is no problem how I going to fix this so we're going to ensure that there is FL okay that's why I was trying to show pictures of uh obviously part of the C has to be otherwise the flow canot there's nowhere to come from so the question is how much of the the job has to be in my view it's at least half of the street on my side well again we're going to lay it all out like I told you I I know we'll send it to you and any other residents on the street but we we're been looking at this we spent a lot of hours out there on the site so we are taking it seriously and doing the best that we can out there thank you um the code review right now Mr Sher has provided me with the writeups of all the recommendations that gathered I'm crosschecking I'm making sure that um nothing was missed and then we were going to start drafting proposed ordinances for Council consideration these won't be able to be read until after the budget the first of the year uh of sorry first of October but um we we will continue to work on that and get Council input um so that we are ready to go and that time happens the RFB for auditing Services came in due date was Friday Friday uh we got five proposals in so that was good because I think there was only six plan holders so it was a good U submission and uh city clerk is in the process of sharing all the proposals with the audit committee and finding out a first evaluation meeting dat and that again some the propos they thought within our budget so that that was good and then just as far as the budget goes in general um I heard back from most council members um our first budget Workshop is June 17th it's a Monday at 6 and I would like to either a zoom meeting or if you want to stop by just kind of do a oneon-one sit down make sure we go through everything and that's it any questions or comments for the city man yes Mr Roberts so um so Kyle on the 23r issue that that that you guys are working on and and your answer was perfect and I'm confident when you said we're going to make sure it works and that that's that's the message so I'm just curious previous to the improvements was there any water on that street that actually flowed towards go Boulevard I do not believe there was okay I know that there was puddling um there was broken curve um what did was we took a complete fall from offl the bore and we tried to make it as continuous as possible um to ensure that the water doow down to Sure possible the reason I'm asking that I know on 20th Street and it almost looks like an optical illusion but pretty much from the midpoint of that street on 20th between Bay and go Boulevard the water flows pretty easily to go Boulevard and the county has a very big uh area there that water disappear which is great so that's the direction it goes I don't know if it was by Design or it just turned out that way but it blows well that direction now so just wondering if that yes yes um and again like we're going to give alternative options just you know CU I know you know your typical Valley curve has got that V shape it may not we or my proposal would be to raise the form boards and create at least two Ines on each side but there will be added cost and we don't feel that right now we're at the top uh which will be the West Side the water will flow um where the curb is meeting the reveal of the asphalt so it's not your typical Valley curve where you have a flow line down the middle and staying right there it eventually gets to a valley curve because that flow line does go down as you get down the street and then you're able to make that shape um but our feeling was to create a valley curve and create that vit um is more of an aesthetic and it won't be perfect but we will provide a price for consideration any other questions or comments the city manager yes for the a services I don't know this question to but I did rece the proposals today and I'm wondering if we used a matrix or some of checklist in the P for evaluating I do have sure she anyone else all right we're on to item number seven Miss Rose you have the other than my report that was included in the packet I have nothing further to report do we have any questions or comments about report I have one brief comment um I noted on the website that we have several listings where we say that there are currently open for or committee positions but I don't believe we say what those positions might be so that might be helpful I can add that okay thank you anything else I would like to make a comment about the U board appreciation Lun that may be something we want to take a look at regarding I don't know a better day a better time because we definitely want to thank all of the citizens that participate in those other boards and it appeared they had difficulty in actually making that lunch because it was not a big turn out any stretch so maybe something we could I don't know just some different ideas on how to um lay that out so that we can thank more and more of those people sure we can consider other avenues in the future steak on a Wednesday anything else right we're on to item eight this is the consent agenda this is for approval of the May 6 2024 city council meeting next I have a motion to approve motion to approve as present made by m Banker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I any oppos all right cons agenda passes now we're on to the regular agenda item number nine consideration of ordinance 24-02 Mr Morrow would you please read the ordinance and provide a brief Su thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 24-02 in ordinance of the city council the city of B Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances subar B Land Development code chter 94 zoning Article 1 in general section 942 definitions to amend the definition of substantial Improvement to reduce the look back period from substantial Improvement calculations down from 5 years to one year and amending Article 5 supplementary District regulations division one generally section 94255 alterations improvements and repairs to align with FL Lan ordinance requirements providing for implementation providing for resolution of conflicts providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading ordinance number 24-02 by title open Mayors and members of the council you will mayor and members of the council you may remember um the priority that you placed on reducing your look back period as it's called for purposes of the FEMA calculations this is the period um for purposes of the 50% rule um calculating the improvements on a property to go back only one year as opposed to the current 5 years as that would mitigate the impact of Prior improvements before purchases um and other simil Li that may prevent people from doing perspective improvements as a result of past improvements and so um this is that ordinance and the two parts of it one is to explicitly change that and the second provision is to make the flood plane ordinance reference to that calculation consistent with this change um in terms of what materials people will work at when Administration does perform that 50% calculation uh so this is that ordinance for a final reading thank you Mr Mora uh before we go to the council to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment on this topic seeing as we have none citizen comments are now closed Council I'm going to need a motion to approve ordinance 24-02 I believe believe I heard a motion by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Kim Shaw Elliot Mr Banker do you have the floor um this really came to my attention because of the damages done by year by a couple citizens in one particular and I didn't really know about it took five years that we had and um while we doing our Cod review this was brought up and I asked the counil the council P this like this prob all just to the extent they more restrictive their statut Li more and my whole was now get and I do think it warrants that recognition for the council um every now and again you folks should be able to have your SS on the back as you brought this up the goal was to do this before storm season was on us and here we are on the first full day of I believe now first full 24 hours of season not second day and here we are so congratulations to you folks on right can speed up citiz all the time he for in the wall this needs to be done any other comments all right would you please call council member bankard yes council member Roberts hi council member Elliott hi and mayor GS hi ordinance 24-02 passage unanimously now we are on to item 10 consideration of ordinance 24-3 Mr you're up thank you Mr Mayor this is city of Beller Beach ordinance number 24-3 in ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordinances sub Part B Land Development code chapter 94 zoning Article 4 districts division 3 residential low RL District 2 Section 94220 minimum living areas and setbacks to reduce the site setback for specified Lots in the Beller Beach first edition subdivision providing for implementation providing for resolution providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading ordinance number 2403 by title only U Mr Mayor as you may recall from last month's discussion this is a very very discreet change to side setbacks on a specific lot um it's really three lots but it only should impact one lot I believe um most directly um this was a a greater outgrowth of the Land Development code review and issues identified by the manager and dealing with administ in the community we are reducing the side setback on a lot in the first edition on threee Lots in the first edition from 15 ft down to 7t um all other requirements still apply meaning that you can't do a zero lot line buildout um within that setback area you cannot um have any structures this just creates a little bit of a more permissive buffer between the two properties and between the this property any property May enjoin um otherwise Happy to answer any questions thank you m before we go to the council citizens any citizen like to speak on this ordinance there are none Citi and comments are now closed we need a motion to approve ordinance 24-3 I make that motion motion is made by Elliot do I have a second second I'm going to give that one Mr Roberts mellot have the floor I think our attorney MOA described rather well as always um this is a very limited situation it really only impacts one lot and it brings it in a consistent manner as all the other Lots set back limits in the city any other comments Mr Mayor I'd just like to add um because the anticipating issues in the future generally when we adopt legislation we do not legislate to specific properties we legislate generally the only reason you see that as an exception in in terms of this particular legislative process is because of the way your code is laid out there are setbacks by Lots within and further still by subdivision so this actually affects three lots but it is to it is consistent with your existing table we wouldn't change for example the height restrictions on one lot in the city um or something like that we don't legislate to individual properties um this has to do more with the way your L development code is formatted and how it format was effective thank you Mr Mo we all know that things get changed for a reason all right any other comments questions M Rose would you please call the RO council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot I and mayor gavis I ORD 24-3 passes unanimously now we are on to item number 11 consideration of ordinance 24-4 uh before I call on you Mr Mo I just wanted to ask you if you ever considered Auctioneer as a backup no that's that's purely a Dominican Talent May but I I appreciate it I may I may Endeavor to to go that way if this all doesn't work out you speak to your children only when I'm reading a would you please read the ordinance yes this is ordinance number 24-4 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida amending the Beller Beach code of ordance is sub Part B land of helment code chapter 94 zoning section 94-72 fences and section 94251 fences walls and hedges to allow for fenses walls or Hedges on seaw wall caps providing for implementation providing for resolution conflicts providing for cability and providing for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 24-4 by title only as you may recall members of the council from last month's discussion on this ordinance U this this is to be create a more permissive allowance for not just um Hedges to extend onto the seaw wall cap but not but not to extend beyond the seaw wall cap um in that manner where it runs perpendicular uh the concerns raised in last month's discussion or reasons for this would be to prevent dogs children and anybody else from going property to property by walking along the seaw wall technically as your code is written U you are not allowed to have any such structure on or above rece the um seaw wall cap and this now makes uh allows for that as opposed to the half Hazard B done it um one of the concerns raised last time was the post within the seaw walls and again you can have defens send over without necessarily having to place a post through and support or deteriorate the structural Integrity ofk Mr all right let's go to the citizens for comments any would like to speak all right C comments are now Clos Council I need a motion to approve ordines 24-4 so those is made by Mr Roberts do I have a second second second by Mr Banker Mr Roberts you have the four thank you Mr Mayor I think um a big fact in this Planning and Zoning Board did have a hearing on this matter and this is the recommendation that came from that as Mr Mo made some great um statements about what the benefits were're moving with this we were really just cleaning up this particular ordinance so um I think it's the right thing to do any other comments all right name would you please call R council member Banker yes council member Roberts I council member Elliott I mayor gtis I ordinance 24-4 passes unanimously thanks everyone for working on these three ordinances look forward to see them in the books all right now we are on to item 12 unfinished business you have any unfinished business May the only business cyber I I would just like to know whether you wish to address to tonight is entirely your prerogative as a council um is the correspondence I read into the record earlier only and I only rais that um urgency from the property owners perspective is they're attempting to sell the property within the next week or List It um and and obviously we have we have a lean the amount of the um of the money's owed to the city is $68,900 provided um here in the correspondence they provided they they made reference to being unavailable or unable to approve the property the property owner at the time was incarcerated for much of the approving violations some of our challenge was just in breaching the property order as a result of that to make them aware of these um deficiencies But ultimately I did want to make sure whether you took it up or not that you explicitly stay uh well I would uh happy to hear the citizen or the uh the the purchaser of the home I know he uh wasn't we had citizen comments but since you brought it up people would than have to let this gentleman speak please go up to the podium give us your name and address and uh tell us what's going on hi good evening uh my name is Vlad Vlad Chanel uh I reside in rington Beach town and I'm for the property at at issue today um as um CDX stated uh currently the property is in compliance with um an ongoing issue that uh particular the neighbors were struggling with for quite some time um been addressed and is actually getting addressed at this time probably getting REM model at this very moment uh so OB obiously uh the city uh accumulated SL expense during the ongoing issues uh with that said um uh currently uh it's I I believe it's somewhere around $68,000 $ 68,276 so uh to make long story short we will greatly appreciate if you will consider to this finds uh as been said before uh the um the former owner uh is not well uh in addition to that uh she is uh she was incarcerated and incarcerated right now uh so um um property is up to Cod and obviously we have all intention to keep that way I just actually had a very nice conversation with uh D Trump uh and uh I encourage them to contact me directly if there's any additional things that we can do to improve the problem um if you have any questions I will be motivated to answer them obviously uh but uh if you will consider to reduce the fines from $116,000 to a greater to much greater to a lesser number uh we would appreciate that thank you very much like I said any questions going to uh wave the rules this time a little back and forth this is the last person do any public speaking and um I'm going to open up the floor to the council if you have any questions what if any uh proceeds from the sale will go back to the owner uh there some yes how much money will go back to the owner uh well it will be determined by the sale because there is a a number of lenss uh legal expenses it's not even calculated at this this at this point in time uh exactly how much uh will go to the one is it more than $69,000 yes yes Mr Roberts who is the owner right now uh they are land trust and I'm a trustee the uh the owner of the property um uh Anna C uh surrender the property uh to a land trust and I am the pr of the property okay so at this point in time under the supervision of the attorney who is uh uh um managing some of the legal and other issues of uh uh M traps while she's as I said uh currently incarcerated uh so uh um the property will be uh sold and liquidated and uh um the multiple parties will receive the proceeds uh and of course cover the expenses affiliated with the life of traps as context saving things that are all public record that can be determined within roughly the last 90 days and I'm not don't hold you to the exact time like really truly within roughly the last 90 days stated the former property owner for whom the violation in initially attached transferred prop ownership to a land trust for which this gentleman is a trustee during that time this land trust and and its agents and officers have brought the property into compliance have paid outstanding tax me of which there were multiple years back in in Mo taxes they have um they taken to try and get the property ready for sale and whether as an investment or or just an arrangement are appointed to us which is of no concern to the city that's how they that's how we've got here um so to the extent that the letter stated we weren't in a position to help now we are the members of the trust or trustee and his and his agents and officers are now positioned as owners of record to do those things and they have done them um and so they've brought that they're now getting it ready to list and then and from a code compliance standpoint I you often will hear me Approach at that from a Cod compliance standpoint the property's been robing compliance um often times when you have fine reduction and Fe reduction hearings um what you're looking at are the same sort of factors you see in chapter 162 which is the the statute that governs the enforcement of fines and code enforcement and when in determining the amount of a fine when you have like a code enforcement border magistrate the statutory recommendation is that they look at things like the gravity of the violation any actions taken by the Violator to correct the violation any previous violations committed by The Violator and then says the board May reduce AOS that section and so they're coming forward to you saying hey my inter understanding of their asking and I will let the gentleman speak for himself is hey you guys want to incentivize compliance we did compliance and we did it quickly once we were positioned to do so so as whether it is as a reward or as it to to unencumber us our request is show that incentive to to compliance different cities have done that different ways I think historically the largest that I'm aware of in the last few years here I'm not going to go back 30 years in the last few years I think the largest was like 50% some cities do 90% um it's really up to you and what you're trying to do here um to accomplish you know their goal is help us facilitate a sale so that that's free and clear and then you won't have this problem ever again with the property owner who has been for reasons either within their control or otherwise who's been the source of these violations will not be the property owner any so help us get to that is there ass question do you have a buyer already well originally I wanted to buy the property personally but unfortunately this life is this property is not really conducive to to my life it's just too small for me and my small children uh so the reason potential buyer yes uh it is also if I might add uh which is I'm sorry it's not directly related to your question when uh uh when you impose the uh the f to the property at the timing was very unfortunate because when uh when when uh the city decided to impose the fines of $250 a day that was pretty much the time when uh she went incarcerated and obviously it's not your problem clearly but with that said uh it is when she when she went incarcerated obviously the $250 a day up pretty quickly while she was awake so uh um but uh to answer your question again uh is a a possible why yes does this uh Property Trust own any other properties not this time not no not was this trust formed specifically for this property yes all right and um no intentions of the trust possibly keeping it uh for to for its own Investment Trust anything like that no I don't I don't think that uh uh that that will happen Okay my my fear is is that we wave the F and it turns into a vacation rental spot no no no no no it's not going to turn into the vation spot okay the goal is very clear to have the uh user as I said originally I was considered appropriate for my personal re but it's not it's not but uh uh yeah it's not it's not the idea of and your existing L development code restrictions against that create new enforcement correct but understood understood was to make that clear for the record in fact I have an offer I'm sorry to interrupt you I had an offer uh from uh uh someone who were considering uh to do just that uh to have some kind of application for and uh uh I am not engaged in this conversation I appreciate that Mr um I sat on this board and um whenever a lot of finds % reduction and everything like that I'm going to make a motion that we the by 55% clear not that there's no vacation yeah I I have absolutely no issue I can make a definite commitment here that uh well obviously I don't know what the people will do later on you know so one they buy the property uh you know how it goes okay but uh as of the trust and me trustee okay uh there is property will be sold to the end user will you explain you've done everything as soon as you possible as soon as you took over so I we should give youy of 55% that's a um what is the deadline for for what you're trying to accomplish I heard something like a week that there's something that has to happen in a week or so is there any deadline at all no there is no no deadline okay do you have a buyer who is going to pull out if you don't if you don't resolve this tonight well I'm not really concerned if the buyer will walk away you know because obviously it's a highly desirable Community okay so it say I'm uh I I don't uh um obviously I have no control of the real estate market but with that said uh I think that um um that we'll be able to find VI especially that we don't have a deadline it's not there is no deadline that we have to meet okay it is all the other Le the property had been paid off it had thousands of dollars in B and you know and I'm not going to worry with a long story of other things obviously the property tax were not paid for 3 years uh it is and uh it's been uh current now okay so there is already a substantial expenses were paid okay uh just for the purpose of not having a deadline you know because there is a the uh the T option is no longer part of the conversation or something like that okay and uh because in order to do all the work in the house um we need to have the water so obviously I have to pay the world and so on okay so this is the one only mean that uh um is obviously still there and um I'm trying to communicate the best of my ability to tell you that uh you know we're trying to do everything we can so and as right now they replacing the broken windows and cleaning the house inside so because uh tomorrow they will start on the flooring you know and that's it so uh when it's done it's done there's no deadline you know so obviously we would like to resolve the issue okay uh and uh um and move on okay and I spoke to the at least three uh neighbors yeah they're very pleased that uh there is no longer Police Department other things that you know I don't have to tell you what happen over there obious so okay all right um Council I saw Mr San's hand raised um does anyone have a problem with allowing him to speak this please come up sir thank you mayor council just try to do the math right Baker so uh 68,000 ID $250 272 days and um this is this trust that now has possession they had a possession for how long Le uh I don't know the precise date of acquisition but I think it was in late March so wouldn't there typically be you know to get clear title any of these Lans would had been paid so we should have been paid as of March so I don't think 55 I I I think there may be a reasonable discount but I think it might be more at the time of turnover and you back into that day and time if if if I I just think we we got to make sure we don't set a precedent as a city and um people have different situations that Unfortunately they go through but uh the the time the city has had to enforce this the time that our uh uh code uh enforcement has had to act on it U we should make sure that we're more than compensated for managing the process so my recommendation uh would be you you probably you a 25% discount do my that real quickly but again if this was properly transacted with the title The Lean would have been paid if the T transfer yes with the note that I believe it was done as a quick claim deed so you take when you in ack claim transaction you take with all incumbrances so let's go back to the date of the quick claim it was actually filed um I don't know if it was filed or somebody signed it but you know uh you know the taxes got discounted the water's got discounted why should we get discounted for all the great services that we provide in all these citizens of jator in the city that's just like thank you thank you Mr yes sir Mr is there is there currently a mortgage on the property no okay what um so let's let's go down the road a bit and let's when the property s and all the leans are paid and all the bills are taken care of gets that money that's left over what when the house when the house is sold yes and there's and there's still profit there based on the sale price and everything else being taken care of who walks away with whatever money is left over a trust the trust has yes okay okay um with regards to advertising the of the property is there advertising so that other people can compete for the purchase absolutely yes as soon as the work is completed it will be listed with a real estate broker okay uh so yes in fact has a sign coming soon as we speak right now on the property the answer is yes because earlier you said you had a buyer I have a potential buy yes okay but uh but the property still will be on the market okay yeah and for the city manager Kyle so that this money that is that is due to the city for the fines where would that fit in our budget and how would we use that money so the money would just come back um in as revenue and go into the general fund okay but no specific requirement any other comments questions I I just like to know I like this we don't like an advanded house here and I think should do everything of course the Count's not going to lessen their fine order and everything else but this is where we live this is what we're trying to bring residents that's why I believe 55% deduction fine because as you know she got in car spr would you say it was $26 something a day every day was P or whatever accumulate quite quickly so she was iner or whatever and that's not the point at a lot I appreciate that and uh yeah the timing was awful and and I obviously I fully understand that you you live here so you don't want to have enough band and Light Property who would okay so and that's kind of the goal here resing the issue and uh uh actually as soon as we start working on property uh we clean it up in 3 days so um I had a pleasure meeting with your city manager on property twice and uh um and I specifically ask if there anything else that we can do okay um I'm still curious as to who is the beneficiary of the trust who the beneficiary of the trust uh it has a multiple entities including if this is referring to the former woman yeah it is so uh it is um some of your current legal and Health Care fees will be covered out of some of the proceeds of the trust and currently the home is is paid for 100% there's there's no de on the home there is no I I'm uh I'm leaning towards the suggestion of Mr Sanic he uh uh he is uh advised us quite often and uh he likes to watch our money and uh I think his suggestion of a 25% reduction is a nice way to reward you for um helping the clean of our city so that's where I'm how about you Mr Rober I think thats more than fair and I think U it's going to help you not as much as a 55 but I still think it's a a significant discount so I'm I also agree 25% just how many days did we it was 250 a day and while the manager looks that up there is a reported Quick Claim Deed that was recorded on it was made on April 24th of 2024 was recorded April 25th of 2024 to the extent that informs your decision making so while I said the last 90 days it's actually shorter than that so what would be uh if we started from zero and uh from the day of the quick land D what what would we be looking at got 263 days from April 24th to what's the that's 26 days 26 guys are making a lawyer do math on the Fly This is highly highly I'm trying I'm try to impress your kids here that's 65 2 6500 is is the uh if you if you take it just from the date of transfer so 25% would even be more than that so that's what I'm that's where I'm leaning right now counc member I have quite a few questions one is what is the normal process to request ement that's that's an excellent question Miss um Charlie one of the things that your manager and I are working on is is resolving that um it has been a little bit more of how we've done it right now where someone comes and usually they're on the agenda again I put it to your judgment whether you took it up tonight or not U but usually it's on the agenda they they request it the manager presents hey here's what it is what do you guys want to do um I as the lawyer trying to remind you we should ground this in things like chapter 162 considerations possible one of the this is one request we' received there's another that's we anticipate percolating and one of the things we're trying to get resolved before that comes up is getting a more clear process in place on the kind of criteria you consider both for your protection and the property owner so there's predictability we eliminate any arbitrariness in the decision making process so um but present to the extent the city has historically done this it has come before the commission and sort of a please consider it based on the totality of the circumstances what are you going to do in like and this Council uh historically uh has taken a very hard line against viors that not giving very little and what I'm trying not to do is set a precs I do understand there was a set of circumstances where um the homeowner may not have been in the best state of mind and then also winding up uh being in custody uh but uh I think at the end of the day uh the trustee the the the family everyone involved I I just I can't let I I can't give a a discount like that I just can't do it because I'm afraid that someone will come back later and say well you gave this guy one um where's my discount I'm not persuaded um this is an investment opportunity properties are very valuable in our state Lots alone 400,000 up um we all know that any con property is going to be subject to any accumulated means and that goes into the purchase price and so either that is time that together and the owner takes less because somebody else is going to have to pay later so I I I appreciate very much um the to do this quickly and to bring it back into compliance but that's also part of the investment value you get it done the F be sold property for a long period of time Ed that we should do this council member Elliot you uh sound as skeptical as I'm feeling right now U so um I don't know I don't know what the best medicine is for this and and I think also that I think it's good that we're working on a process but perhaps there could be a standing committee or you know one of our other groups that can do some back I mean we can speculate evening about how these facts came about but if somebody's incarcerated you know they still have the opportunity to rent their property they still they it Appo an agent an attorney to help them rent it and maintain buy property management I one one of the considerations for the process is looking to have it go as far as F reductions um to go before the process so but that's in ter of process we are considering options administrative orici it's fine if we act as some sort of appeal process perhaps but it seems like um a good process would include somebody's doing some backf finding and putting story together and and considering it and that's that's the the struggle that I'm having is that this is all on this I don't want to get bogged down in an entire work session to resolve this that's why I was willing toar this genten out and find out what it was we were uh we needed to decide on and there are a lot of um you know questions going on in my head how much money is the trust going to make and where's it all going and is this truly just how much money can I get out of this house has been quickly to a trust that ultimately goes right back part of it to the owner who just did a quick plan Deed on it so there there are many many questions I have uh I'm I'm just to make this go away can I answer any your questions perhaps sure I would to do that it as um so if you questions yeah I think I think the problem solved okay so it's in my view okay so obviously you want to have a clean property in your community so that's what it is so um so obviously uh we can have a long ongoing discussion and uh wait you know until the sale of the house for as long as you wish uh with that said um I suggest maybe we can just move on so with you know quality people that will move in the house and um and St I'm sorry is are you happy with the 25% if we gave you that 25% that resolve everything tonight you're not going to file appe stre try no way not 25% and I understand your position I I understand your position and I understand that whatever happened to the previous order of the property is not your problem it is you want to clean house and in your community uh my my concern is you taking this the court and appealing it okay and then judge would say hey she incarcerator for 200 and some days I'm going to Red there's not a clear um it's not clear that that's even a civil action it's actionable well anything could be you can file anything I just in terms of how chapter 162 operates that's not 162 and I don't have in front of but it clearly says we should consider reducing it okay if they and I think they comp well this Council needs a majority to uh uh to move on something like this and um right now I see we've got one person one council member who sounds like she doesn't want to give anything uh we've got one here that wants to give the world away I want to give the world away don't say that I want to give something that I'll get resident in this house as soon as possible make sure there's no more legal action well based upon the amount of fine 25% off of that fine is 16, substantial amount of money and I believe for $166,000 I could have regard imaculate so um I I think that it's uh I'm willing to do 25% I'm willing to go with the 25% too if he's willing to drop the you know what I'm saying no more legal well I I don't there's been no indication that we pursue that as it is but we can't find these proceedings and there's presently no on the there was a motion made that not receive a second motion terms procedur where we stand at the moment well there is a motion 25 no nobody made nobody's made that motion you made the motion for 55 did not receive second no other motion someone like to make a motion for 25 motion made by franker do I have a second second second by Roberts all in favor I oppos all right you do a roll please just so wasn't clear I could not see okay M Rose would you call the RO council member Banker yes council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Elliot no mayor gtis I so by your vote it's approved at 25 yes reduction which is a reduction of $ 17,32 41 all right if my map is correct we will clear that up and I will I will communicate that your legal council we receed this Council has agreed to reduce the fin thank you very much all right do we have any other unfinished business and um Mr Mor you're not allowed to bring up understandable m one issue I don't know this business or not but do we look at some of the benches at six Street one is broken not SEC some of the especially Sunset ask yeah we'll take a look at that any other unfin bu business sir um I I tell you in uh I think tonight we sort of did set a precedence for special circumstances um this this was a little bit different uh circumstances than we normally have where someone just ignores ignores ignores inlex um this was definitely unique and I think uh whenever if we're trying to to develop a standard we should take this into consideration I 25% is a a reasonable reduction under suchal circumstances as we develop a policy we'll keep that in mind and just understand as well I I know it's it's Habit to sort of say we we set a precedent but each matter will stand on its own there which is I think also what you're speaking to um you know sometimes there's an inclination to just look to your neighbor and say well they got so I should but that's whether we talk about variances we talk about it doesn't work that and so we can make good point and uh thank you for reminding us all right if there's no other unfinished business let's go to item number 13 Council comments I'm going to start off with council member Banker okay well there's two young persons in the audience tonight while we take a lot of your daddy's time hopefully tonight you can see how well he represents our city and many others so we thank him for this and I hope you appreciate uh Thursday's the 80th anniversary of DayDay hopefully we all remember who who currently serve have served especially those that all their day reach like that's thank you Mr Banker now following up on my comments regarding Bay Street East Bay it seems like it is going a lot better um I did attend a webinar that was on the improvs made on not East West Bank um look on the website as far as the specific dates but they are starting a project to um re uh resurface and uh correct any of the issues on West Bay as well as install Medi the middle of the street that will be used for decorative pures as well as kind of redirect traffic a little bit part of the purpose of that project in addition to just maintaining streets is to better connect the panel's trail to the rest of the city all of that is good news except that it did not include connecting it via bicycle trail found that there wasn't enough room um that the existing Street structure to be able for any ples so that's a disappointment but um we can all look forward to some more opportunities when they start constructing on East Bay I'm going to echo on that right quick and then I will turn it over to Mr Roberts um yeah it's it's amazing that we have the traffic that we do and they're actually narrowing the lanes and they're putting islands all the way from Clear Water lgo Road up to Indian Rocks Road and one question I had was about are you doing anything with the merge lane you're trying to beautify and you stop right there and you leave those ugly things in the road but uh uh I also feel bad for the the business owners uh that are along that pathway because a lot of people are going to lose their ability to left turn into parking lot you'll have to go around make a urn and and come back to be able to enter these businesses uh I I look forward seeing how beautiful it's going to be but I also am worried about the traic you know they had the full plan laid out I'm just grateful that they're not putting a dedicated bu L down because that seems to happen occasionally around County and and then you lose a l entirely Mr Roberts staying with the traffic Mantra I did this on Memorial Day weekend I don't know if there was something special that occurred but the um traffic I mean the car lights were Bumper to Bumper at 9:30 or 10 p.m. on Saturday night and or Sunday night so that could have been uh just due to traffic volume which was not a great sign Mass exell yes yeah not good anything else that's it all right um Mr Reaper the only thing that I really had is it's the traffic light at our intersection uh we we really need to kill one of those green lights that that represents going straight and and I'm going to tell you why it's because I've been kind of neutral about do we want one do we want two do we you know is this going to work or not so there was a great big truck in the left lane waiting to turn left he's going to go slow I hop in the right lane the light changes and he came all the way over into my lane I had to lock him down and I he never looked at me one time I'll tell you why it's because he saw those two lights over there and thought I'm going straight down the road that I wasn't going to make a left turn so he thought the entire turn was his I think I think between removing one of those lights aligning them properly so everyone knows whose light belongs to what and then restriping the the lines moving them back I think that that's probably the best opportunity we're going to have to to fix anything I don't I don't think there a real good F but it can't hurt it can only help yeah but drunks can't see those but the lane you were in was specifically a green arrow turn it was the right Green Arrow turn right turn L and I mean had to lock them down coming right over on me there was nothing I could do about it oh well well look U my my driving horse and uh just thank everyone for watching at home tonight and uh anyone that showed up tonight thank you for being here and uh you kids get to bed early tonight all right the City attorney had a hard day today other than that everyone have a good night um do I have a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn as city manager Tak kids out for oh yeah do I have a second second all right all in favor I any oppose all right good night everyone for e"
