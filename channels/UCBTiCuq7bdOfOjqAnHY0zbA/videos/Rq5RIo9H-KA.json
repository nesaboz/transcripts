    "transcript": "good evening uh ivan reeves and this is kyle reiper uh he's the one that kind of takes care of the the permits and what we're here to talk about is swim in buoy zones in the gulf of mexico from basically 19th street to harrison that's basically where they run this is the map of the original buoys for their and i want to kind of give you a little synopsis for what happened 2002 the city went together with bella shore both cities paid for and we went to the state got from putting movies to try to take care of the safety in the gulf of mexico then in 2020 we went into updating our buoy section of it and because we had some buoys that were missing if you've been in that area we had buoys that went away with the hurricanes and stuff together and the state said we'll roost the rest of the movies while they were in the shores area so we updated the permit with our movies and we couldn't move louisiana um long story short some different things happened some people were concerned about movies and better shore uh what it turns out the situation now is the state is saying our buoys are not correct because the coat said with a statue which is florida statute 327 section 46 says i have no weight zones you have to have a establishing ordinance which we already have that but it has to be within 500 feet of above ram uh hoist marine railway or launching a landing facility or it has to be 500 feet from fuel pumps or things like that dispenser so what that means is we don't have that in miller beach all we have is the gulf and our programs out there the only boat ramp we have is on 7th street so the state came back and said to us you need to fix your buoy problem so that's where we're at right now we've had discussions with the state we've had discussions with a couple of work sessions with the city council discussions but we wanted to get public feedback so that's the purpose of this week to see where we want to go so this is the buoy configuration now our options are take the moves out entirely that's one option another option is to create swim zones and it's only swim zones no boats no anything you can do in there another option is to compartmentalize the swim zones and leave some areas in between them before we can uh allow a boat to come into shore a couple weeks ago there was a boat that kind of grounded itself on the beach down near the park so let's flip to the map where we talked about option one uh okay this is an option where we declare where the boat zones are and we leave the swim zones basically remote zones small swim zones very large and expensive that's an option or option two we don't even delineate the boat zones we just basically build a perimeter like in this area you can see the buoys they they would be out 300 feet there would be a buoy every 150 feet going across and then 150 feet coming into the shore and those would be dedicated swimsuits in between those movies you could leave this space and if a boat wanted to come in they could so there's kind of two trains of thought there where you say it's a boat zone and somebody slips over into the other area it may not be beneficial to do that so this is another suggestion of what we might do we're trying to to update the permit with the state and what has to happen is the buoys that are out there right now go back to the first one the buoys that are out there right now we have to remark them and possibly relocate them depending on what we want to do if if we want to make all of that a swim zone all we have to do is go out with stickers on which movies and say swimsuit that means no no vessels of any type can go in there [Music] may be one or two missing now but we put them out there two years ago basically and they're that they were in places right right so uh so the option you know that's what i'm looking for the feedback for for some of the residents to say do you want to have an entire swim zone or do you want to have a kind of mixture so at this point if there's a question you've got that i can't answer tonight i put a little card out there and you write on it and leave it over there and we'll get back to you but so now i guess what i'm asking is uh public feedback any thoughts has the talent been asked or questioned by boaters hey there's a need for this i mean i've i mean obviously not knowing what all the rules are i've never seen a boat beached up on the beach it's hit and miss occasionally you know as an example so you live in a comment no no somebody someone mine is an example let's say well who is you you look where you live okay if you had guests and they were down at the beach and you wanted to take your boat and i don't know if you have a boat but if you want to take your boat out there and pick them up in the current situation you can do that because it's an idle no weight zone but we have to correct that because we don't qualify for it now if it's a swim zone you couldn't do that as an example you couldn't take your boat out there and go into the beach and pick something up if it's broken up in the swim zones you could do that which would um paddle boards and whatever they allowed all these swimsuits yeah yeah it's it's mainly motorized vessels like sea doos right okay so perhaps you could give us some background on why these buoys were put there when did they when they started in 2002 right and what was the public policy reason for having i don't actually know what that was because in 2002 i wasn't here for one reason but i do know that uh the buoys were put out there to kind of slow the boats down because maybe there was a problem with speeding boats you know coming along the shoreline i have no idea if if there was or wasn't but that's probably why they were put in and at the time the statute allowed you to have a i don't know wakes up so any police reports or any injuries that have been reported nothing's ever been indicated that anything has ever happened that would cause this to be done no it just was done this was just done it was no no rationale behind it it was not well i'm sure there was some rationale but what about at the same time that they also put them in a digital rocks yeah i i think the rationale was probably the same they thought you know they've been there for any incident since you no we haven't had any incidents to my knowledge so what do we do well that's the question that i'm asking you tonight why do we need them do we need them or do we just you know because what the state's done now with the issues that's been brought up the state has said you need to fix your ordinance and you need to fix your you're doing swim zone i have you can't have an auto zone because you don't need the qualifications so it's either for the matter or lack of words it's far enough you know but you can break and state says in their statute and it's that what it's designated is public uh bathing beach or swim area and the the buoys out and the gulf would have to be re-stickered if we made it all the swims on them so we have not used slip number one in the arena for what about a year and a half parents why could that not be opened up for boaters that are residents of this city strictly to pick up their gifts since we are not using them because of this so-called outfall and then we would have a place to dock a boat to load people just like you would at seventh street in that project then we this would be moving well there is an outfall that slip is very small and that's why it was taken away several years ago i that's that's what i know about there is an alcohol at that point we have allowed it to be open but it's you know depending i guess on the width of the boat you know you may not even be able to get maybe get a small boat in there but yeah i'll give you a couple different things other than that there as someone who's voted 40 years on this coast this area really is safe we know that so what we're trying to accomplish is satisfy the need to answer to the fwc so as it relates to why do people pull up to the sand typically in this area i'm trying to think about there and leslie maybe you would know there's an area under great buildings it seems in the summer around the fourth of july that area has some people come in for long weeks or whatever it is a couple boats are out there a couple boats are in there with fishing boats they're vacationers and they're doing what i would do if i was on vacation other than that it is very rare to see people pull off even residents but when they do it's because wherever you live in the city maybe family is down on the beach they have a couple chairs you're bringing the boat all the way around through the pass you're out doing whatever fishing what have you coming from another area and you know they're there so you're gonna pull straight in anchor never in the sand enjoy some time with them give them some rides as it relates to the dog maybe you're gonna carry the dog off the beach walk home walk him or go walk the dog it's home but it's not it's not visually a situation where we have boats coming in all day all weekend it's very rare so i think the real question has happened to traffic and why is do we want to take away what we've been for 70 years and that's the ability as a resident to pull your bubble up in anchor out of those rare occasions so additionally when you look at a line this is where i want a sunday just verifying this visually voters outside the city know when there's a marker i'm not going to go in there or if i do i'm going to check to see what it states on the moon and then kyle can you go back to the one that just had swim zones so this one is interesting if you took out some of these middle and i know then that you had mentioned fwc suggested putting something in the middle these not the straight line on the outside in the middle of going from 300 foot to now so you were you spaced those out 300 feet visually if you're outside the city of ballard beach you don't know what our ordinances are you're not even going there as a destination you see buoys and you're not going inside if you did now you would realize and stated i don't know wait if it changes and it states swim zone motor exclusion whatever it may be they're not going to pull in even if you do have these gaps that we as a city know are just gaps so from a citizen perspective to solve the problem regardless of all the history i think the goal should be to highly satisfy fwc while we make sure everyone's happy with what we've been able to do for a very long time without any problems that's just if you keep the movies i don't know if that helps i like what you did here then and i don't know if it's specific well these are just like the walkways like yeah we have four walkways right there's some depictions i feel as if morgan street park should be designated however it falls into the coordinates is definitely an area that one of these motor exclusions falls into and leave open the four walkways again no one outside the city is really aware other than we're going to have a line of movies all the way or the south that spin swimsuit they're not even going to attempt to go in but to wanted to hear some condoms it seems like it's an easy fix if we just use those walkways that we just built as a i don't even know if it has to be that long 50 yards 70 yards whatever it is 35 each way just need that capability for someone to come in and we've satisfied everything we need to on the buoys but if others have concerns time to have a lot overseas whether it's unfortunate or fortunate we're talking about it we're going to probably be solid these are some great options where do foilers fit into the motorized vehicle what where do foilers fit in to be to this they're not motorized yeah they are well if they're yeah if they're motorized then they would be so example they couldn't come in here okay they couldn't come in any of the swim zones because they they'll launch from the beach they won't be coming in right so if they've got a motor on them yes [Music] what about if you anchor the boat and the tides are always moving and the wind's always moving when you anchor particularly if you anchor overnight you put out as much rope as you can right because you don't know what's going to happen so you know when we do it it's maybe 300 feet broke and so it would go you know 600 feet well we just saw your boat out but i mean you know the wind's going to blow it in every different direction uh even though it's just stationary there's not a perfect solution to all of that you know there's just not that that's tides winds uh you know this isn't the perfect 300 feet that's not the 28 foot comes out when you're trying to find her exactly what you're talking about many years ago they used to drill them in they for the most part they don't do that anymore what they do is they put a heavy concrete anchor on them and they just drop that in an angle you know yeah but years ago they used to grill them in with a like a healing helicoil drill and unfortunately when a buoy breaks away from that it's a struggle to even find it well it's even a struggle with the concrete but we try to keep the coordinates like on the first map there's coordinates that are for your gps and that's where you put it back and we hire a contractor to put them back in what we do is go out and buy the buoys ourselves sticker them that way there is some savings to the city by us doing that buying the moving direct from the manufacturer roger yeah the uh portion of the conversation it appears that we have a lot of voters here that's great because there should be a way that we can find a way where both swimmers and voters can have safe access looking at this map i think if i was a boater i was coming in if they had that many zones there'd be so many lights coming out that you wouldn't have a clue where you could come in i think well is that a swimsuit or is that a boat song so it seems like feasible way to do it so that uh the only time i've ever even seen a boat come on is one of the guys right under access had a big party when they were just coming out of the roads but that's really the only time i ever saw that that's why you see it yeah so what that tells me is we don't need a ton of these that would probably just say put one in more than one in the south people who are picking up people they could just uh walk up to the area there's we we only have one two mile long beach just give them an access zone so that they could meet their goal of being able to pick up their family but most of the people using that are swimmers and we want to make sure that they have a safe i'm more concerned about what she was talking about we've already seen bicycles with um with the battery motors well these spoilers have got those those motors underneath them just like a surfboard well every beach in california's got zones for for boats and for surfers and for that and then they have a swim area because there's too many people running into them and we have we don't see the problem right now but i can see foiling become a problem for our beaches because the kids are already starting to use the beach for their e-bikes i understand that that that's still happening so does that make it safer no it doesn't you do need to be concerned about that well i agree with roger on that because i mean if we think about it on golf boulevard we don't have a couple of walkovers to get physically get over to get food but from first to to cause what we have we have one one crop across one crosswalk so why so many swim zones and movies outside well you're missing the point we're not talking about crosswalks we're talking about why no but what i'm saying to you is why have if if we only have so many walk overs from off across the main road okay then why have so many swimsuits that's what i'm saying you do and and non-stone center i think it's confusing i i think that um people people just need to have like like say go four four blocks or something and then you have a pull in for votes or something i don't think you need to have that many spots i think it's just crazy to have in these positions then we're talking about a cost factor here then there's more booze here we have to mark them off right yeah that's yeah so what would happen the long list of buoys we would have to adjust them these would probably stay the same in the first option they would stay the same but we may have to relocate some or buy some additional buoys so basically if you look at the swim zones here we're going to have to buy 10 additional the other part was um if if we are going to mark those movies ourselves to save money and the only way say 50 pounds can you not and there are floating basically they can float the storm why can't we place them ourselves and save some cost we can't place them how would i place them what are those anchors it's probably 400 pounds okay 400 pounds that's what i wanted to know how much it helps yeah we can buy the buoy right but the anchor and stuff we have it simple what i'm saying here is you're designing you're designing this and laying it out around boats and boats are the occasional infrequent guys and the swimmers are the well if we have as an example boat zones we can do away with that put one there or put one you know and that's this is just a theory you know what's missing is sometimes the language can throw us off so right now in our entire history as a city we swim in people right okay everywhere it's not like one or the other threat and there's been no problems right now because of the situation we have to do some markings right it's not as if people aren't swimming for one of these gaps we've been doing them for so many years let's keep that in mind well you have to do it because the idle zone that we currently have that we can't have anymore that's what it's been yes there's no issue about and we haven't had any accidents none you know that i know and i just wanted to add two and two and i'm sorry if i i may have upset can i say walkways on the road because we have four new four more balls well those boardwalks that go from you know the cos um that's just a perfect simple designation okay let's let's grab 50 yards here and keep it simple not much is changing the way that we do business here we're just changing the markings and those that do know need to understand those areas whatever you decide is where you're allowed to you can still swim there just like you always can so the markings are clear on how they will allow you to do it and all voters that don't know about it aren't going to stay out because of the natural line the things such as all the different variables to teaching and i i think i know what is being referenced on those motorized boards that rise up i think some of that is for different ordinances that are originating from the beach so whether it's polarized bikes whether it's you just start you know i hate i would hate to see a system take away a kayak so that's not the end that's not overthinking has anyone considered the aesthetic nuisance of putting another 30 or so weeds out there in the gulf i mean i think part of the aren't you putting 30 movies out there already i just counting them up well there's those are already there well let's do this over here i know right they're not so that's what i'm saying those are not exactly attractive as you're walking along the beach you see all that plastic stuff floating around right there i mean has anybody considered any of that i mean these are some of the most beautiful beaches in the country and why would you want to litter them up with all this garbage out there and it really is aesthetic nuisance to the gulf of mexico i'm sorry man you know it's an interesting point it goes back to that question of do you want movies you probably do but when they're in a straight line parallel to the beach it does a lot more than you think and that's from a safety perspective regardless of how they're marked but what he's referencing are those ones that give the box and that's a recommendation by the fwc not a requirement right so you don't have to do that i don't know if you have to or yeah thanks you can verify that i'm i'm under the impression you don't they suggest you do yes what it says here it has to be designated okay so if you're going to designate a swim zone you're going to do it in boxes as an example you're going to have to destinate that's what it says in the statute got it so we can't say from this street to this street but we have to designate we'd have to mark it off right you do want i was saying is and to you know it keeps coming up that you know we've never had a problem but going back to what mr lutz has got never had a problem because we've always had that line you know even though we haven't had designated swimmer votes zone so that's why we haven't had a problem because we've had buildings [Music] but but and i don't i'm not in favor of nobody's i think we need movies i kind of like this setup with the swimsuit only markings no boat markings but i agree you know you know with glenn we should make the swim ones bigger because there's more swim areas than boat areas and i don't i'm not saying where to put them that's up to you guys to decide but we definitely need something and i think it's better like what mr musk was saying once this happens the citizens of this city are going to know what is there and what's not there so like i know dave you've done it i've done it we've gone around and picked up family off the beach when they're here we'll know where to go safely and we're responsible voters so we know so it's not us we have to worry about it's like that one you said was beach and the the drunk ones if they see zero buoys they're they're just going to go whatever they want now boating when i see a buoy i'm not going to be running up against it i know to stay away so i think we have to have buoys for safety and the argument that we've never had a problem doesn't mean we won't tomorrow and if we can prevent one future death then it's worth the movies to me but that's my medical knowledge but i agree with one of these two great points but it in reference though to the people who do have votes i never realized that they wanted an access to where they come in and i don't have an issue with that i think we should be accommodating people in our community but it just seems like in conference they live in newport beach california they do it it seems like all over the country every one of them has buoys and they have a large swim zone and they have one place to come in for the boats some places with a really long beach half two but i think as long as we let our voters know where they are so they pick up their families whatever they need to do so it seemed like it would be central rather than one thing to the other but then that way it keeps the swim zone integrity there i think that's what the load area north and south and so most too but admittedly it's confusing because they see this and they say okay they're spies and that probably is overkill for us but there is buoys from an aesthetic stem planet obviously you want to bring in your boat anywhere but uh i don't i can't think of a major beach in the world where they don't have bullets i could think of [Applause] and look from pensacola to jacksonville this is about the only place you see it in the state okay well i don't know well don't know california that's just warm water so you can get it in nantucket because there's not much accents as we have to guarantee ourselves as a city that we designate somewhere in that zone the mortgage hornet park but if you just get on the water you're north and south there are no police okay well now i'm not i'm not a buoy fanatic i'm just saying that to me it seems like a good idea and uh but it seems like we're trying to make a lot of things just for a voting audience and i think our voters should be taken care of but why do they need the entire beach because i have seen people going very fast close to the shoulder i know you're probably responsible but i have seen speed boats going along our shore very close especially during the spring break and so so i i agree with you when that i think we should just have one north and and one south i mean you know that's all we need is just two because if we also here's the other options again you have seventh if you open up the first slip right arena strictly for our [Music] i'm not sure why we keep going to the base side yeah he's talking about the beach we are talking about i think a lot of people in here are everyone in here goes to the beach so we got this whole swimming thing down yeah those that do vote should probably give a little bit more perspective on the voting because that's all we're really dealing with it's not as if they're getting special privilege because the reality is that's what we've always had right we've never had issues you should keep louise going on the base side to pick someone up let me give you an example of a family son daughter-in-law baby wherever on the north side of town are middle of the town and i want to take them out we have to walk a half mile versus 50 yards to get on a boat that's the purpose of breaking it up this way again we don't have an issue we already vote it's just not visible to anyone because it's not a problem so those that do are probably in favor of war spaces let's not get caught on it it's not unsafe we've always been doing it um scenario i was going to talk about is there's there's a marina there's tingling south here and above going to take but certainly if you've got visitors or family with small children you don't want to take it and make them do all that instead go to the beach and wait so you're vlogging all that stuff to get on the boat how far are these are they expecting the law to get that vote i'm not i'm i'm not against movies and i'm not against swim zones but there are things to consider because it is it's uh for people that don't live on the water paint in the butt to go get your boat load everything up and then pull around you've got to go way up top come around and find so we just have to be careful about what we do because at the end of the day the customer is all of for whatever reason to make that trend from their house cross court boulevard across the beach and then you still have to lug all your gear wherever to uh to catch up to wherever you're driving the boat listen i think we have to remember that even though certain areas are designated as swim zones nothing says i can't swim between those swim zones i'm going to just you know i can swim anywhere i want on that beach it's just that a boat might be coming in there so it's sort of swim at your own risk if you will they do it every day i can tell you this if i'm doing 30 miles per hour and i'm i see that i'm staying i'm not going to get it if i if i get even close to that i'm going to be at higher speed motorcycles i was out on sunday again and i was looking at so indeed is it the indian approximation so that gap between dollar stores and dollar beach that's their decision one but even having our movies and you can see in the distance the movies of the next town is a voter that still keeps you in line of staying out that far so first of all okay if you've got your boat dry docked somewhere your people can pull their cars up there and when the boat gets put in the water they can they can actually go so that one doesn't hold water but the other thing is this looks so commercialized we keep trying to talk about aesthetics within our city with that many zones that looks very commercialized okay i think it looks horrible but i don't think we need to have that many zones now plus we have more people that walk over now that's my point to go swimming okay then we have people that pull a road top to pick up people personally yes i think we should have a designated area four of the boats to come in okay but i don't think it needs to be that cluttered i just you know i mean i i just don't think there needs to be that much so right now we on the westerly side of that all those buoys are currently there right would it be possible to have a different colored buoy on the floors do away with the blue ease between the beach and the ones in the curvy out there there's anybody that's going to vote and wants to know what the rules are and you know it's going to is going to see that this buoy to the beach is a line whether you see it or not you know that i've voted out here for four years we stay outside of the pools and a lot of times we'll fish them looking for triple tails um to this gentleman's point about you know having just a lot of you know you know visual you can eliminate those ones in the middle and like anything else when someone goes into the city they get a welcome to the city here's this here's that well here's the you're the needs [Music] like having all these side swim zones i just don't think you'll see you know it's not something visual you know [Music] because we're being told to so that's the problem was that it wasn't time is direct question that fwc did we know that it's stated designated swim zone do we have to have those videos well from the conversation i had with him he said if you're doing design screens well you can do that and and that's you know maybe this is a bone tone and that botom doesn't exist right now it doesn't exist and then the other one does officially actually one right that's basically what option one was well no no option one was bigger swim zones but there were three boats yeah okay so i shrink it to a couple of votes so we're all amazing yeah nice job everybody yeah that one shows morgan street which it shouldn't be about right so but anyways can i make a compromise can we combine option one and two longer swim stones would eliminate the boat zones and make those i guess what i'm saying is you see what they're saying is we don't want to have like 10 vote zones which i agree even as a voter so do like this where the swim zones are long and instead of that one in the middle just have the top and the bottom so we have a long swim zones but we don't designate them as boat zones like in option two so long swim zones in one don't designate them like an option too okay so cop you would love option three real quick just kidding [Music] about swim zones and the majority of discussions around books i mean what loves so i agree with you reduce the complexity one large swim zone and it's not a destination though you can bring a boat in at the top of the bottom and the other thing that's fallen out of this thing is the complexity you're adding for the swimmer because people are going to the beach to swim how are you going to designate the swim zones on the beach the boaters are having a problem identifying where they can come in but on the beach people are dragging their kids around and we have signage and flags on the beach saying okay this is a swimsuit we're doing that now well i think the purpose like he said the purpose of the buoys is to keep the boaters out not the swimmers in and it's swim at your own wrist but i will say my only thing is just make sure there's swim zones at those walk overs because nobody will want to walk right there in front of the walk over bam the boat like just the boat zone a little bit more you're going to look at your destiny areas and say family you need to go to this area of the beach and i'll take you up there not just willy nilly go there and i'll just show up we would use and i think the best thing to do is use wherever in the north end wherever there's a beach access is with the dune walkover that's that's should be a that are bringing their boats to the shore to pick up their family or whatever they probably drove there so they have to pull that car somewhere and if they're not residents of miller beach they're not supposed to be parked in the streets so you've got to keep the thing you're going to be thinking people are stating that the bigger the swim zone alice uh as a voter it would be wonderful to move uh north the south a little bit and the south went north a little bit other than that uh well they're all making parts i i think we need if we're gonna make boat zones the access to them from across the beach so as an example if you've got a company you can tell them okay the access okay that's where you should go right right you know so here's the walk through so maybe the one is there or here yeah as long as it's not right in front because that's where people park their stuff to just swim well i i do think that the gentleman on the red shirt though did have a good idea though because for the voters and again i'm not a voter but it would seem it would be nice where the two zones are instead of whatever color the abilities are that they have like a red one so that they know when you're tuning the two red whatever color you choose i just have to say right here so that way it lets them know where they come into the beach if they're fwc would have as it is now to look at what the regulations look like throughout the past there's no no wakes up but it's enforced right it goes back to people in this town are going to know sure the people out there that are just going to pull up onto any beach that doesn't look busy and park and have a good time it's going to discourage them right i think is what we're going for and what's this how about like the buoys spacing they have to be 300 150. is there a set guideline how far apart it off so that's regulation right because he's those are the set guidelines it can't be like 400 or 500 so we are stuck with that many buoys that way okay but because we have bigger swim zones we're going to have less of those you know ones so we can save some money there for that yeah so if you end up with two let's say you end up with two boat zones yeah you're talking about four moves right so it's not a financial issue it's more of those resistances so i have a two-part question it's a jurisdiction now first of all everybody knows that the these this sand bottom belongs to the federal government not to fish and wildlife that's a well-established part of law so who has jurisdiction over enforcing this the coast guard the jurisdiction of the city of vallarta beach goes out 10 miles into the water well that's not it's our jurisdiction that's not accurate i know it is i know this for sure i i represent treasure salvors i've been through this in litigation the state and federal courts i know this is federal property no it's that's not what i'm saying i'm not saying it's our property i'm saying that our jurisdictional boundaries so as an example we have a sheriff's marine patrol our jurisdictional boundary on this side goes out 10 miles on that side goes to the middle of it and so who's going to who's going to enforce this i mean who's going to write tickets well this i mean how is the guy going to be sitting out there with uh you know some very sophisticated field glasses trying to figure this out and say oh okay we're going to cite your vote if it drifted into this typically if there's a problem the sheriff's office is called and that the marine unit is dispatched that's typically what happens you mean vision of the state people no well the same you know where the thing is down here down there salt rock it would take a boat 40 minutes to get out there now they're in there i know where you're talking about but that's where they all come from that's where they come from but they're out in the in the in intercoastal they're out along the gulf they're they're out there that's that's what their job is to patrol it's like the co-star i mean the coast guard can stop anybody they want either out there or in here they can stop and ask you to board your boat to look at them yeah i mean just but all we're talking about is anchored and let's say it's out there for a day or so you know drifts because you've got the anchor line out um you know who's to say you know well you're you know three inches over the line here then we have this you know really we're not we're not going to that [Music] so the issue is collaborating together on the issue we're changing valor beats forever as a result of this religion so that's a sad day the issue is really for access to votes or he wanted to be all swimsuit which we've never done that's all it's the policing thing i can be really surprised how limited you see a sheriff coast guard uh fwc in the ball right in front of ella beach unless they're going out of call so they're wasting our time if we're calling any other resources how about hey excuse me neighbor did you move it over a little that's just how that's okay but we're off bro so i guess what i want to kind of get from the group is is the consensus to just put a couple boat zones in there one north and south uh at in the uh eastman walkthroughs the new lawn coopers area and the rest of it with even swimming pools just make sure the boats help consider not sitting but it's one of those things like if you know you're going to pick up your family and one of the accesses is near the 19th by the feller hotel you tell your family to walk to that access but the next day when you're not going to pick them up they can go to any one of them right that's just there are days where you're coming back from john's past on the lunch you know you know what's hot [Music] it happens all the time it isn't just for a situation of pick the family uh or walking across the walk in the water so so it isn't just a pickup zone let's give the voters that live here the ability to use the golf the way we always have that's the discussion from my perspective well part of this discussion is to comply [Music] unfortunately because of a couple conversations with the fwc it's it's created an issue where the fwc has said you either comply with the statute are you taking them would they force you to take her or could they even disappear by a strong nutritionist well legally then i guess but i think if you look at other people to count these who you're in protein you've got more boat traffic more sooner than the water than any place your density is so much fire and last time there was an accident up there yeah so the only thing in california and rightfully so and why i keep bringing up morgan street park it's just the carliwell country club public side of the gulf is where they decimate the box planet four movies other than that north and south of that no buoys absolutely beautiful that's why you think harvest street because we have so many people with presidents and outside individuals we we need to designate that right [Music] there's no buoys anywhere in the in the land but over here it's gotta hit this and for the most part the coast of the buoys the only thing is driving this thing is we're concerned that fwc is going to say we don't do anything you've got to pull them to do well is that something we can talk to them about well you know i can't tell you they're going to come enforcing i'm just telling you what they're telling us and unfortunately the situation that created it is got [Music] no they've been very good about and basically what they said to me was because i said are we going to have to go out and gps all these buoys and do that they said no just take a like this is 19th street 100 foot north of it we have to create a new ordinance because our ordinance doesn't meet the state statute we abolish that ordinance altogether is it a possibility that nothing was done i and that's not a safe way to look at it i mean our number one goal in this city is safety of our citizens that is our number one strategic than on our strategic plan there's been many boats that have come in come close and and they're still going okay when there was people out there swimming so i think there should be vote movies in the thing and as far as anthocy goes that that is basically a general there's no population there in other words this this is all residential here and that's the different difference between the two this is residential so you can't do that by comparison second thing a lot of boat rooms go on that city this city and we're kind of caught in between okay so so we have to address the issue for the protection of our citizens in one way or the other and to just let them float away or never do anything will be so wrong on the city's part when it comes to the safety factor okay and then just to piggyback with that i mean i understand where you're going but my fear would be are you going to poke the bear more like if they're already kind of targeting us and looking at us by doing nothing and ignoring them is that going to piss them off more and then they're going to come back with god knows what and then we're going to get in more trouble so i think the compromise is to for safety sakes my option three have the bigger swim zones with two designated bozos and kind of find the happy media we gotta do something to keep peace so maybe we should just do the minimal that we need to do we don't have to get all crazy and fancy and i think like you said it would be less buoys if we get the longest closest do we agree that there's never been a safety issue with this ever and since the beginning of bel air beach has not ever ever been anything against them whatsoever because we've been talking about the strong things that safety but it's never been a problem never i could tell you that since 2002 since the buoys were out there there's nothing to say any problem and prior to that i have no idea so i would say our track record of having you know they weren't there incidences but it's a testament to people who is that we're not there if they weren't there they would come in closer to 300k yes and then we will have a problem 300 that's a long way out and uh and that's why we don't have problems it's because of that i'm not in this community and i think this is [Music] [Music] but i think it's the labeling even if we kept the boobies where we were we have to change the labeling and it's either going to be swim zone only or take the boobs out or something so the compromise would be one of these and that's the that's the point that i'm questioning is yeah they're giving you this option but the question is these are busy people and are they really going to be focused in that now if they they say hey we told you six months ago they do this we haven't seen a response then say okay yeah maybe we've got to get out of us and look for that letter in the mail and reminder in the mail saying hey you know we haven't seen your reply to your timeline either way you need a plan so even if six months they do send you the nasty gram you need to have an act so that's what we're doing we're playing do we need to do this tomorrow no do we have six months to come up with any additional funding we may need yes i don't think that timeline but i think the question is do we need to do it whether it's now or eventually when we get a nasty girl it needs to get done when i don't have and that's a good point maybe you just say we have a plan and here's the implementation step you know from now we'll have an idea of the layout i think that's what lindsey knows that's what he's doing that's what he's doing yeah that's exactly where we're at so [Music] you know we gave him you know a map when we first started talking about this we gave him a map because they said and you so that's one problem okay so with that in mind we have to have a plan to do something now are they going to come down here tomorrow i can't tell you they are but it's it's kind of if you're going to poke the bear which is what happened here then they're going to pull you back and say you needed to why and it was a hot button topic button the only problem here if we look at the legalities we've now addressed it from the start so if somebody gets hurt and we didn't try to move forward we stalled it or we didn't do anything how are you let's think about that i mean why didn't we move forward with this why didn't we pursue it why do you believe it so i'm going to ask one more time let's say we have to do this the consensus of the group plan from what i'm hearing is unless somebody has a different plan put a couple zones in there and make the rest of it is that right here not for me but you want to see some grass roots there's a lot of water [Music] this whole discussion around pick people up isn't the reason that you pull your boat up so if you move it up to the second and then move it down to the second boardwalk now you've split it up so get rid of the bottom one and so those aren't exactly and that that's not exactly well they're close but they're not exact we're we're trying to give some concepts that's why we got two it doesn't matter where exactly it is my request and it's just mine it's not about picking people up only so if you could bring if you had two empty areas could you move one south further south or one further north and the other picture you had up well as an example here's the walk through yeah that's the hotel right there okay so just to the north of that that's that projection we just filled this in there's another excess in that general area thank you so so you got morgan street covered and the left and right of it a maybe a home zone an empty area right instead of north or south well it would be north of the south of the center yes but it wouldn't be as far north or as far south right now two would be acceptable but they need to be spaced accordingly to where you're not right on top of where people are accessing the piece to swim right at the same time get as close as possible to equal distances so that no matter where you access it's better so my question is if you have 300 feet wide i'm not poor against it one way or the other i'm just the people who have boats currently because i used to want to vote would that do they think that it would bring in some basically some commercial kind of people coming in or some people from the outside pulling up into there if it was that white and hearing well no because i've gone to shell out with my boat okay many many times in other islands but i think and i know that i can pull up there with my boat but i i think you have to look at the fact the average person that's out there other than our residents wouldn't even know where that boat area was because they're no different if we follow this plan the distance between our existing buoys does not change right we're adding a total of six internal buoys to give you two gaps that's right that's it and that's it you're really really strong questions if you're what does that happen now for 70 years now but i know what you're talking about boy these areas they can become crazy areas once it gets out that's what happened at 12th street last march [Music] so there's a compromise on some of this can we say if it's a swim zone there's a new shark fishing as well that's an issue that's really a big issue out there it's much more dangerous than boats is the shark fishing on the beaches the issues outside of a plan to whenever we address it these are all great subjects they really are but it's not time to use okay well i thank you for your time"
