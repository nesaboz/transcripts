is the park um survey presentation so everybody had their parks assigned um does anyone want to go first or should we just go around the table it doesn't matter what order nicole wants to go first okay nicole are you ready sure so you want me to just like talk about them or yeah and then show the pictures yeah all right if there's something that you think needs to be shown you can pass the picture around kyle do you think it like when um can you combine everybody's emails and send it out to everyone so everybody has like in there yeah for your records yeah for your records and that way you can just get a visual today and then i know you have that nice recap sheet that you put together and um i'm just gonna go in order as i like seen them because i remember um even though i have pictures i may not get all the emails no you're good okay so i did the marina and um overall the marina is in really good shape i mean obviously besides the parking lot but the gate was fine the walkways were fine and then um there was just one thing that i've seen that i was like i don't know whose property this is but um this is like open so if someone was to trip and fall they are going to fall in the water this is the picture there's like the gate just like cuts off so i'm not sure i thought i would just ask about it like if that's even our property or not that is that was old slip one um which they stopped running out as a slip because of the outfall that's located in it um and then it used to be the fence came all the way across but the idea of changing the fencing was to allow access to the water from the marina to the vallarta beach residents that did not have a boat and a slip okay so it was the idea was for the our beach residue you know obviously their sticker to be able to put like a kayak or something is there a kayak ramp or you just there it is it's kind of like a drop down you'd have to do it pretty carefully yeah because whenever i was really high it'd be easier yeah i did the marina survey last time and it was it was fully fenced so we must have still been renting out slot one mm-hmm yeah so that's like what i've seen and then we weren't running it hasn't read it in a long time oh it was just it was just kind of scary yeah um so yeah that was like the major like issue and then everything else was good like the greener and everything was maintained and then the locks were working because like obviously i couldn't get in there so it was like working but people are maintaining it they usually tell us when something's not functioning correctly yeah so that was all good and then um the next one was morgan park overall that was also um in good shape there was just a few things that i seen there which i'll get pictures [Music] um i did see like some cracks like in the um like parking lot which was just gonna get resurfaced great seems like every parking lot needs a little help um i'm pretty sure this was morgan park um [Music] yeah there was like this hole that if someone's not paying attention they are going to fall and break their ankle i'm pretty sure it's morgan park but i can double check um and then that kind of looks like an access yeah it has to be it has to be one okay so then you know we'll find out which one usually those have covers though on them don't they the excesses i don't know that hole is from picture weird it looks like it's got sand in it or something what yeah so maybe it's not i'd have to look go back and look sorry awesome i was just looking for my other pictures but let's see what did you write they're not in order but um so yeah parking station was working um all of the like benches were fine there was a good amount of trash cans there wasn't like trash everywhere um obviously i said about the parking lot oh it looks like 12th street okay and then yeah um i did see that partial like trees from like the neighbors at morgan park were like growing over so i don't know who handled typically we typically just trimmed what needs to be trimmed on our side okay yeah there's a picture in here of that and then the other thing was like there was a picture of like stagnant water and i don't know if it's just like builds up there from the shower but that was morgan okay yeah that was ah there they are where was the water behind the trash can so all of this but other than that everything else that's okay because that there's poor drainage there and we trench that area out to keep it off of the walkway okay the keypad is safe cool and the bathrooms were fine i checked them um and then so i'll kind of like just do them together so 6th street and 12th street beach access both of them were in good shape like the benches walkways all that was clear there was nothing like really concerning and the other thing for both of them was just like the parking lot like had the cracks and then that one picture the 12th street picture of that dip but other than that like everything was the greenery was maintained and the parking was fine so nice yeah did anybody get um the packet for belle isle because i surveyed that one but it's not in my stack so i have four but i have i did five i will check i had that one i know i did i just didn't know if it landed in somebody else's i have my four muscles so i got two south parks from you a second street a hobbit hibiscus 16th that led which day did you email that it was they're all together oh it's like yes [Applause] may not have come through see it's it's on my screen it's going through like it's between 16 look it's between 16th and 2nd can you pour it in yeah i'll see if i get it i'll just print it i i don't have time oh yeah they should be on there okay here we go all right i'll probably send you more emails from you should i just keep going yeah just keep going hopefully it comes to me okay george do you want to go next sure i'll just do mine together um i'll do 7th street first because carl has the plans for seventh street and i think everything i saw is going to be updated in the seventh week project one thing i was concerned about was the let's see and boats that are moving generally in good condition um sea wall is in poor condition but that's going to be fixed potential improvement ramp is in poor condition that's i believe going to be fixed although i don't think it can be it's got two levels in it and one of them empties out into shallow water out in front and i don't i don't think you can get a boat out there through those two levels it might if they they might have trouble getting it into the water because it's so the ramps are not smooth and going down they might change through this thing it might hang up somewhere okay and it's of course the ramp area is very narrow because there's sea walls on the other side of it so they're going to have to be very careful trying to launch it yeah a boat from there when i looked at it the docking area was was gone but that's going to be replaced and um i guess they'll be tied up there has to be tie-ups on the docking area before you launch the boat you tie it off first and locks will vote um oh the the entrance to the ramp area passes all those pipes and pumps and all of that stuff on the right end the south side of the road to the ramp um it's kind of ugly it used to be not as complex and we had looked like trees around a foliage around it but that's not the case now and so it's all these pipes and pumps and stuff i we want to consider landscaping some way around it to hide it a little bit because the property owners i suspect on either side are that wouldn't be great for property value going through all those pumps and pipes and stuff and trying to get to your house so that's something to consider i didn't take any pictures because i thought it'd all be changed when do we expect that project to be done they just recently got the bids back they came back higher than budgeted so council's been told they're either going to approve you know the bids as they are or trying to figure out if we want if we separated because we bid the seventh street fitted all together hoping that that would give a better price so we did the ramp and the sea balls together um but we're thinking try and find out we're getting an estimate if if we separate it out and put it back out to bid if we'll get a better price so so we're in a holding pattern until we understand council make some decisions we're going to get an idea if if we think we could get a better price if we don't then council will make a decision probably to um you know cut back on it to fit think can we cut back on it and to fit in well they would it sounded like they were willing to pay more to get the seawall replaced and then we're looking into an alternative option to refurbish the boat ramp if there's some kind of overlay that can be done just to improve the condition because it's still functional as far as kind of three areas the way i see it right now there's boat race dock and the issue about uh aesthetics surrounding pipes and pumps and stuff like that yeah that would have to be okay for the county because i have to find out what kind of access they need for the work they do so okay well those are the three things that stood out to me and hopefully we'll be able to get some of it fun to do yeah the other thing i had was the 19th street beach access and initially when i said so i said it's really good condition everything looks fine but the sand dune in that area has really grown a lot seaward and the only path out is right on the north side of the showers and i guess the tandem tries to keep pushing that direction but if it doesn't we're going to have people all going through that property private property on the north side of the axis so we're not letting it get any to grow anymore um as far as to the north to prevent access to the beach i didn't give you a question so yeah we're not going to let it we're not going to let it grow to where you can't access the beach from the beach access but we can't cut down on that used to be that the walkway coming up to the yeah it was probably open right there it was open there and there were some steps there with the handrail that went down to the beach yeah and that was growing so much the same access point it wasn't to the south so we already we're kind of stuck with what we got right now yeah but we have to keep our eye on it because right make sure it doesn't grow or use it does grow we might want to try to cut a pathway straight out again the way it was well we can we can maintain what we have we just can't cut it back because of the sea oats is that yeah because we can't destroy the dew and it's there okay i just the other point i i mean it's it's really nice to be able to sit on those benches and sunset and look at the out over the water and watch the sunset and people walking up and down the beach um there's one other thing on the south side of the park area in the middle of the sand dunes there's a sea grape tree ugly tree is that protected or can we cut it that is protected because it's to the uh the sea side of the coastal construction seaside of the sea word of the coastal construction of the uh nourishment area yeah it's regulated so the line is the old seawall right at that point it's pretty much right where the old sea wall was and secret of that you can't touch anything um there's regulations um you can trim it so much a year i know we can trim the seals and trim the coats what about that on private property and then there's regulations for anything anything she would have that yeah yeah because the sea oats are getting well the seals are so tall in front of the south side against the entrance you can't see anything really anyway and there used to be park benches over there but now there's no sense how the bench is over there to look at the back side of the doom i guess there's somebody might want to watch that out about but um is there something we can do there as far as elevating the benches up where those palm trees are and looking out from there put the benches up on the grass it's just tough to maintain around the bench without a pad of sorts that's something i think you should consider because we really don't have any we're only getting half the park area and two benches or three benches i guess so there's south side of it and you know what kyle on um in south park there's a bench and it's on the grass it's not on a pad it's not even really on you know they put the shells around some of the trees so maybe yeah and then you can put shells you can put shells down it doesn't have to be like a concrete that would be a less expensive way than a pad but it is done at south park where there's a bench with no and they then they mow around it i guess that's my point so they do do it there um but there's no sand spurs like on the beach accesses if you walk through the house thank you and george you can take this one home to donna oh okay because i'm refraining from the chocolate i think i've just had so much crazy cookies in the last month i gotta say no somewhere she'll appreciate it because i know she has a sweet tooth she does okay anyway we try to keep them away from the walkways and the shower and all that but we don't try to maintain them all inside of that whole grass area because it's just so much to cover so you think there'd be sand squares up by the you can put benches up there um not everybody's shower won't be okay um well it's something to consider because we're only utilizing half of the park area there is the grass that much higher than where the concrete is a little higher that all that used to be level and it used to be a sea wall or it went down to the beach over time that dunes built up the beach is rising up and then all that grass the sand blown in and raised all that so you got like a good two feet off the sidewalk now just from sandballing and they dig it out all the time i notice yeah they dig out to keep the sidewalk exposed but the rest is just elevated yeah and it's and you just can't see over it but that's why i thought if we had elevated benches on the east side of the walkway i don't know right more utilization park um and the other thing was the sea grape tree that i'd like to see cut down but i don't think that's going to happen oh what about the possibility of a bike rack or something like that for people that want to come down by the bikes and go for a walk on the beach is there someplace we could put a bike rack there um i mean is there you think there's enough room on the north side i can't remember to look at it no upside where the where it opens up yeah it seemed like we did have something there at one time in background for a while i don't know if there's enough room because of the windblown sand filling up the grasses yeah so i don't know the answer to that but um it's worth looking at and seeing where it might work most people i know on like sixth street they people who bring bikes they just kind of either put it on the back side of the bench yeah i don't know i know some people used to when that walk went down the steps to the beach area before it was all covered with sand people used to put their bikes on that and put a lock on it on the rail on the rails so i don't know it might be a consideration for a bike ramp a bike rack there yeah that's about all i have then okay thank you george can i have your you know did you just tell us everybody i'll scan it and email it [Applause] okay uh i did four of them and crossman park which is right across from here this little caddy corner um i thought it was really well maintained i don't think there was much you know i don't think it's heavily trafficked i don't think it's used much the only thing i saw that um there was a garbage can back there i wonder how much it's used but there was a sign on it at some point and it's kind of hard to see and i don't even know what was on there but you could tell there was a sign there there's a stick right there oh okay you can see it oh i think there's nothing about it are they anchoring the can to that to the uh new channel i'm not sure i'm pretty sure that was a sign at some point i could look back at my phone because it looks like it might that's it it might be able to just come out and like yeah so listen it's i'm just nitpicking at this one because this one was really nice there's a big dead bush in there i think that could be cool it can be but it's the rest of it's really nice but yeah we'll rip that this can we take how long do those need to stay there i know they're necessary and important and their markers for pipes and whatnot but the entire corner including the posts the wood posts so i kind of was driving in and i was like gosh i was just driving in you know yeah looking at this it is spraying it looks like graffiti spray-painted top to bottom and i know they're important but i wonder if they're or deep in what they were used for if they've already been done maybe we can scrub them off now or it's hard for you guys to see back there if i can pass that around that has lettering going up and down up and down that's from afar and then there's just tons of like the entire corner is just spray painted it gets passed through if you guys remove it is it the other i think we're waiting on the communication lines to be done and they're taking a long time okay uh 20th street park this one was made this one was fun um there's multiple people's mailboxes on property and i'm sitting there and i'm going next door i'm like this is a single family residence why does he have three mailboxes and they have different addresses and as i'm standing there some lady comes out from across the street grabs her mail and then goes back across the street and i go whoa whoa whoa and i'm like is this your mailbox and she's like yes she's like 20 something years and she rolled her eyes and went back inside you know and i was like so i talked to the neighbor and he goes well this is my neighbor's mailbox from over there this is her mailbox and i go and he goes and his mailbox is cut off and on the floor uh it didn't make sense to me until i started driving around and realizing there's a common theme with mailboxes being on one side of certain areas of cellular beach i mean see hard to see that there's a black mailbox right here yeah i see it that is his mailbox this mailbox that's on the floor that kind of fell off that is his across the street neighbor this mailbox is caddy corner to i took pictures of their houses but i did 20th street for the historian part of it used to have just mailboxes on the south side of the street yeah in clumps of three so it's one would be across the street on the north side and if if you got permission from the post office to change the where the mailbox for when i moved there my mailbox was on the south side of the street and because my wife was handicapped it wasn't about to happen she'd never get the mail so i talked to john the mailman and he said oh yeah no problem just talk to the people down in indian rocks post office so i went down there and they said okay and they run around a piece of paper pick up on the my mailbox and since then everybody on the north side of the street decided hey george can do it they have mailboxes i think everyone should be entitled to have their own mailbox on their own street and not on city property i don't i can't imagine this being that much greater for the mailman but it's not like that anywhere else it's not they're not ever pockets 25th also they didn't have any mailboxes on the property itself uh i was talking to one of the neighbors and she's like well there are mailboxes on my corner over here my mailbox has to be on that corner over there and i'm like this doesn't make any banana sense and i was looking and i'm like okay i guess that might save the mailman an extra step on being on both sides of the brand but it's not consistent so i i don't know but that lady who came across the street she was like it's been 20 years like this and she's sounded like not thrilled about how was she has she ever asked or not but i don't understand why it's on city ground property and why i mean he's got to fix the not her but the guy across the street he's got to fix you can't just have it on more you know yeah it just broke off but he's like it's been there for some time yeah anyhow something to look into i'm sure they would all appreciate happening in their boxes not on maybe they don't know that all they have to do is call the post office and say hey i would like to move my mailbox to my side of the street um on my own property is that possible and then they just have to reach if they just move their nails like i'm gonna like on city property i've never i guess the city did that for them at some point someone had to have done that on their it just doesn't um for 25th and 20th street they have these monuments because that you know was dedicated um but they're rusted it's kind of um seen better days i don't know if there's got to be some kind of a solution out there to like to buff it up a little bit and to get that rust that's coming off and just they're both these are two separate ones but they're both doing the exact same thing so the sidewalks definitely need a good pressure wash around them um but staying on 20th street what else we got here oh palm trees so here's the pressure washing that can be done it's pretty black i don't think that would take too much but there's palm trees do they have access to electricity or would they have to get a power washer that has like a generator you have to get a generator out there and then we also got to get a source of water um sometimes when neighbors want things pressure washed they offer their water to us um we could probably tap into the reclaim there used to be fresh water at every part but now we don't we'd have to build off of the reclaimed water and then use that to pressure wash with uh what's wrong with the palm trees they're really old really really tall um i think it just would look nice if they were uh refreshing you know a lot of trees like maples oaks everything they just look better with age but palm trees definitely are not part of that group i don't think um but this one in particular by the power line here you can see right there it kind of frays off and into the close-up that looks like it's difficult like i think it's gonna eventually i think you have plenty of time these things are like rubber sometimes with hurricanes and they seem to withstand it but that looks like it's pretty diseased and i'm guessing it's gonna have to come down sooner than later it's just really close to the power line so i figured i'd highlight that one that way and we do have to get that one trimmed um and i'm guessing it's not yeah that's not a contractor do that one because it's so close to the wire it's close to the washer maybe we want to just move it yeah rather than maintaining like yeah other palm trees won't grow much stronger that species of palm tree will grow up to 90 feet that's the washingtonian do you see that one on 20th that one used to be short it's really growing fast the one that's it's closer to the water i don't know if she's got a picture of it it's kind of right near that sure and those there's also it's just sprouting really fast this also has a kayak little drop it's got a little lift bar that i took a little video of it when you lift it up the whole thing shakes right to left and so yeah i saw your video then it's cracked yeah we have some replace i don't i think we got the right color i think like something that could yeah yeah to put some replacement yeah yeah and same with the other one this one's much uh uh yeah soon that was a good find and then the other one looks like it's already on its way you know it's just from use going up and down yeah if you put pressure on it anyone could break it about halfway down the path there's a cedar tree which is an ugly tree uh-huh i think we should get rid of that this one cedar the cedar tree where and then the outside of the pan at 23 that as you go down you'll see a cedar tree there and it's really an ugly tree that they just get the guys to try to trim it up to make it look very decent yeah that's a cedar tree oh you know i didn't mind them as much as they minded the older palm trees that are really up and high yeah but you also have to keep in mind like i paid four thousand dollars wants to have a tree removed so it's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination so unless it's a danger or you know like the power line situation but if it's just or you know it's dead and it's gonna fall anyway and you have to take it out for liability reasons just because it's ugly or you don't like it maybe whoever planted it liked it but it's they're so expensive to have taken out those washingtonians though you can get out for like 300 and then use a subgrinder for like two um and if you do as a group it would be a lot less but it's a hassle um that one just happens to show and yeah yeah the one that you that looks like it's got more damage to pictures here's 25th these are a little younger and they look just kind of nice i know it's hard to tell from there and then these ones i think are getting pretty tall i but that one was the one that looked kind of bad and it was kind of in this corner are these washingtonians those stables the real tall ones in washington the other ones are safe [Music] like you know the ones that got the accesses they're like real tall they're like third party yeah i've seen them in the woods california if you look at the branch you'll be able to tell right away yeah because it's either got the center the like the stables have the yeah his head goes through and then he got the thorns on the floor yeah so it's really easy to tell and then along um the seawall are you doing anything about small there i couldn't remember no no okay so there is something that i think you might want to look at but i didn't notice anything like soft in the ground in front of it but so this close up right here is from this corner okay [Music] yeah but it was just this corner here they all have like cracks and this and that that one just seemed to have more of a significant line going up and down so that um that uh 25th um the no parking sign neighbor actually i'm driving here nuts that's crooked she's like can you guys just straighten that out while you're doing this and it is it's a little outside she also uh begged to have these there's like wood colors right here and they are dark green black and she's like you could just pressure i'm like pressure wash wood like that and she showed me hers and she goes oh yeah what are they for decoration okay so it's three pillars tied by like like a sailor's oh are they like different heights and then you've got yeah there's a seven there's a third one behind it you can't see the third one here you're just flanking kind of the sidewalk there which is like it desperately needs a power wash and it's hard to tell but this neighbor i'm thinking is planting here i don't think you guys are doing this no it's gross papayas there's all sorts of interesting things that are really grown up past his property line into ours and i'm guessing you guys are having to maintain this yeah jungle here something to look into if do you guys want to look here but one side you can see i think [Music] all sorts of great stuff okay it gets a little jungly and then [Music] this one has all these little borders they're all cracked and broken i still think they look nice i still think they're fine i wouldn't remove them i think it's a lot more work than it is yeah there's been a talk of possibly trying pieces now yeah they don't bother me though to be honest but i could see how somebody else had yeah they all like loose and they weren't they could lose and it's just over when they breakup i still think it's nice bayside park and city hall um for bayside park all of these signs i love these little signs but they're no longer of service you can't read anything really on them they're getting old um you know just talks about piper's name brooms manatees but you can't read them you can't read them water has gone underneath the plastic and compromised underneath all of it it'd be nice either to remove them or replenish them this little bridge access that goes down to the water that's right there yeah is soft and gives and it's i'm guessing needs a full replacement of some sort or it it's really soft it's gonna when you go on the boards it so if 10 people walked on it do you think it would collapse uh i don't know if it's going to collapse right now i just know someone's going to have a foot going through there at some point that wood is going to rot just from the weather outside okay yeah i think if you want it forever you go with that like composite wood you know that plastic what is the bridge over here the brace drops into this no no what's underneath the bridge what are these mangroves i thought it was these roots that's at the landing of it so while i'm sure that this is protected of some sort i don't think the dead ones are so maybe just clear it a little bit just that little that's the only place that most people go because you can't really walk any further you kind of get either to the bridge here you get stuck or you get to like a lot of the the what are they the secret is that what it is look i don't know what kind of um bush that's growing with the big leaps yeah that'd be a secret secret those are really you know and i don't think we should turn that back i think we should just clear off maybe these roots a little bit it just it kind of would be nice i think people could put that but that bridge goes that bridge what does it bridge from dry ground to yeah like grass to the beach and it goes kind of over could the bridge be shortened up i guess is what i'm thinking and you just have this typical walkway over the rocks and eliminate the most of the bridge it's an idea yeah this is just kind of little beach area there it's going to fail all the way water you can't really put your towels in and things like that and these are dead so it wouldn't be really i don't think um yeah that can be they're they're gonna go back there shortly to do the trimming here i felt them they're stuck in there you know um the bike rack is kind of old it just wobbles yeah it could be replaced if we're looking into other bike racks otherwise it's still functional um playground it's got uh duct tape above it that's a question of if we're even gonna replace things outdated that's either going to go away or they're going to pay for a new one yeah i just pointed out since i was there i don't see a ton of children playing out there uh there's a ton of and everywhere like i need mass amounts of them you couldn't like i sat down for a second and i was like fans lots and lots of things okay if i had my kid there or toddler there it would just be like you know you'd run yeah i just probably wouldn't hang out if you take it out what would be done with the space maybe you consolidated it more to what existing useful playground equipment's left this little climbers and things like that yeah i think i mean i don't have any ideas the trees are excessive in that whole area too and the story i got was that they planted trees that had to be removed i think they were in the accesses originally and they were told that to not have them there so then they stuck them all over at bayside that's why there's so many oaks but they just need to be trimmed back don't they yeah um it's just like uh that's one thing you deal with because you have so much shade and leaves in there so you get a lot of moisture and mildew on all the grass dyes it's a nice canopy though it's a good canopy it's probably a little excessive and they do trim them yeah they do i don't know why i don't see this here but i definitely there's a giant um dumpster oh we're still using that what are you using uh that's to finish up our mangrove trim yeah is this permit no that that i'm surprised [Music] is those cracks are foundational cracks um no amount of resurfacing or feeling they're going to keep forming until we redo the hole yeah they're that's all and that's a bigger a lot bigger job so i talked to you know the tennis contractors and they can fill them again it'll look ugly um on the fresh painted surface so if they because they filled them when they did resurface but it doesn't take long for them to come right back just because they're cracked all the way through the asphalt and the asphalt tell me an inch um now they have to typically do thicker asphalt for quartz at the time then we did an inch layer of asphalt so that's why it goes all the way down to the ground um something in the long term that needs to be budgeted for but since as long as these cracks aren't a safety issue no certain aesthetic issue it's an aesthetic issue um you might as well get what you can resurface and then we really the next time we're going to do something or i mean it's a big year savings so it's a lot more to redo all that asphalt yeah [Music] it just breaks out it's about four years old now before zero no we're just four that's four it's just from the salt yeah it breaks down quick that water fountain yeah i have an actual backup too no no that's right so you should have saw the last one that we replaced it it almost was breaking in half from just does the glitter found out there yeah is it rusty i didn't even know it's the one that got replaced it was well you could probably kicked it and broke it because it was just where is it it's really rusted yeah it was quick it started rusting like that's the bottom of it yeah it just needs to be straight and painted that looks new believe it or not though i actually can you can squish it down so i can see where it is um it's a tennis courts uh between the so between the tennis courts and the dumpster or a side oh you gotta walk through there okay that's why yeah yeah it's it's like everything here but it just it breaks down quickly um that was like a about a thousand dollar water fountain um something in the future if we replace it again i could go with stainless option it would hold up better like the beach showers it was still you know fading stuff like that but it wouldn't rust as fast i actually have because they said that they sat down when it had some kind of damage but i can't remember what it was that they sent me a whole another one so i actually have a brand new exact fountain that i was going to eventually use once that one got to the point it couldn't be used anymore it worked and the inside looked nice which was always key i think that's what we care about yeah but yeah it's like the grills too we periodically go through and like scrape them down and paint them and just try to keep them looking decent until they break down all the way through and then last thing yeah major thing i think is that bridge and i think that will give at some point um with enough pressure on by one thing do you think it's bad enough that it should be blocked off like a caution tape at this point i don't know if it's at that point i didn't try to jump on it or anything it just i could feel it but you know if we have a wedding here and you know what i mean like half the wedding party goes out to like walk down there that that's all i'm asking because we do have large groups of people here a lot that aren't familiar with the area might want to see it because they're only here for the weekend or something right yeah we actually had a lot of people here last weekend yeah so i was just curious if like you know you had a big group go out there and all go out at the same time if it could hold weight or if it needs to test down like it's how it'd be interesting to see if there's a way it did not even need it wait i'm thinking at one time it's not cheap to replace it especially with the yeah or maybe you just put some support boards under here yeah we'll be looking at that too and that would be way less expensive than everything that's kind of what we were doing before we replaced the amber walks but the access is on the beach you know we were just i'm keeping them alive kind of with you i don't think it's necessary to be there i think it just kind of uh streamlined people for an access point so they wouldn't just walk through the other yeah you just want to create access you know maybe i think at one time the mangroves were all up in there and it was a way to get through them because i think when they now cut back in the mangroves we don't need it yeah the mangroves yeah this kind of wrap and stuff on the side like maybe that's why they did it is so that people wouldn't the mangroves though i think he's right they opted at one point to clear almost a big section of mangroves which kind of you know in the end made it hard to do anything with any of the other mangroves because of some kind of deal they made with the water and navigation so we have some real large mangrove trees to the south of that but we can't do anything with that it's that kind of that's what i'm sure that was for and we don't need it all now all we just needed some way to get over those rocks right so it'll be a real short area rather than replacing the hole yeah open it up and just make sure it stays open that you can access yeah because i don't know it's not cheap to do a whole boardwalk and if it's not even i don't think it needs us but then you got to move all those rocks and kind of just make some sort of a pathway that guides people through that instead of trying to walk around and i like that little area a lot of people i always see people utilizing it speaking like to get reworked when we were looking at that grant but there's still money from rayside park improvements the idea recently has been to eventually get a gazebo out there kyle if we have a list from like everything that you guys have documented and then like things that we notice that you like feel like you need to take to the next level and have them taken care of in order of priority how do you decide what gets done and what doesn't if you like when you said we have funds to improve bayside park how do you decide do they vote or do you guys internally decide well it's it's disgust um like linds has mentioned it that you know his idea of putting the gazebo out there um ultimately they got to approve it so i guess the idea is to just to accumulate the money i mean to to obviously make any repairs we can that aren't major you know as soon as we know about them [Music] i'm not a helicopter pad oh on the helicopter oh really yeah do it yeah yeah we talk about if you take out some of the playground equipment that has duct tape that would like be a beautiful spot yeah because you know the people set up their weddings on the helicopter pad if you put it in yeah [Music] styles seating ledges on the hill um yeah but that would be kind of like how to be designed obviously you know but that's kind of that's the idea when the vision he's talked about okay i was going over the bridge too what whose is that it's like a sailboat type of sculpture wasn't that donated by the garden club was it garden club it could have could have been i don't know that could use a little spurs just that would be um i would imagine so that orange was once vibrant i would imagine and now it's kind of a brown orange i've never seen it look good you've never seen it look good no i've only been here just coming up about four years oh my gosh i was like maybe we should see if someone has a picture of when it was first installed all right last but not least i have five parks okay try to be brief and everything was perfect right no no um okay so the first park that i surveyed i did south park 2nd street 16th street belle isle park and hibiscus park east so it was good because there was a couple that i had never been to before and so it was a good good to have eyes on but so i started in south park and um number one thing that i noted was the fences on both sides are new and are in really good shape they're very well maintained so that was great the sea wall is in really good shape other than the south corner that is part of indian rocks beach property line there's that part gets kind of cut off so literally it's like you know how they're blocked off in sections there's literally a line in the sand and it's just so that's i don't know if that's something that we can make if they inspect it or if they even pay any attention to it i'm not sure i think they stopped on the the indian rocks beach right away line with that sea wall yeah but i'm just saying like the the part that belongs to them yeah i don't know if like that is gonna deteriorate and bring down the rest of it yeah no i know so it's just i i don't know where you take that if you maybe call them and say hey can you guys take a look at this and make sure it's safe yeah i want to um check with them because i'm sure they discussed you know what they were doing so i don't know what's in their plans to fix that okay and then um another one of the things that i noticed is um so it's kind of like at one point there were some like shells like decorative around the trees but they all look like it's years and years old it needs more shells i haven't done shell them two years just to get a whole bunch more shells yeah like for for the most part all parts that i looked at need to be they either had nothing or they had something at one point and it's mostly gone um so the utility caps in this park was really good but it looks like one of them had just been replaced and had been run over previously by a lawn mower or something and there was like 30 pieces of purple plastic that had been just oh so it's like that was a mess that probably someone should have cleaned up when they replaced the cap that got run over by the lawnmower oh yeah so like if you blow that picture up you can see all the little purple pieces here but all three of these caps are in really good shape okay so that was just something that i thought if like a dog steps on that or a little bit um so the bench is in good shape that's really all that's in this park um because this is on the south end and there's public parking and street parking available in my opinion this park could really use like some security cameras or some lights like this south park the one right at the very end of the city so on that bench there's constantly people smoking pot there's constantly yeah sorry yes across the street from brown park so that's public parking because it's in everyone's parks there and walks across the street and nicole pointed out to me and i took a picture of the nice young lovely used condom where people go to that park and do whatever they want and so i don't think we have that in any of the other parks and then like maybe a month but bayside is that okay like a month ago i know they do it on the beach but like a month ago somebody stole all the caps off the sprinklers in the same park yes that was very weird so even if we don't install it you know just put up a sign or a light like a solar light that doesn't need electricity where it's obviously going to get a lot of sun those are in as long as um you know the neighbors are on board with it we don't because people get sensitive about lights street lights well one's like carly over there everyone has a big fence now yeah well the one in indian rocks beach like she said they're in ireland eight months out of 12 and the other people complain about this all the time and i'm sure they wouldn't mind some solar lights like so when it's pitch dark back there and you cannot see your hand in front of your face unless there's a full moon so it's just a thought that it might detour some of this because bayside you're across the street right home yeah oh yeah it might be so just your friends is usually the parking lot yeah or just do the neighbor or something really between you and the park that's the potholes and they're the ones that complain about it more than anything because they hear it and smell it and so they're like yeah you're allowed to smoke you can still smoke well i didn't know if you know like a lot of times public parks you cannot smoke yeah children at play no smoking so i don't know if yeah certain different cities have different roles i didn't know again you can smoke outside but can you smoke at a public park some of them allow some of them don't i don't know what your guys's rules are you don't have no smoking i watch a couple every single morning and it doesn't bother me because i don't live there but right between debbie and the grey house that just sold they go down what is that second street um and they have their morning their new pajamas their roads their morning coffee and cereals their morning cigarettes and i could like i know if i was either one of those whichever way the wind was blowing and it's 5 30 in the morning that's what i'm waking up to and i was like i mean you know they moved the bench though because she saw them outside oh yeah no i no i know that's one thing you know the park closes at dusk right and then no smoking on top of it i think that doesn't make people do whatever they want the hours are said they can be determined like that wasn't a big one but i think we'd have to we'd have to get the council to change we already changed the hours there i know that's how you talk about this talk about smoking that would be an actual have to be changed as an ordinance that would be nice it would not have something to consider yeah especially i mean some people are like if you live right there like you said with the wind it would be bad but like i think some solar lights would be great just to light this up a little bit because if there was a little light it might deter them bayside no one lives around here so it's like it's more like i don't know i think less eyes on you but like for south park i think it's just because there's public access and it's so dark that it's they feel pretty safe so yeah i think if i don't know if you have to contact the phone number for your neighbor yeah you can ask me yeah no because that's what i'm saying she's across the street and then they're the ones right there yeah and the other one are the hours now on that park oh it's a nine so it's six to nine six to nine it used to be 11 but it was just very very late and causing issues why don't we just cut the hours back we did it because that's not really even the problem people do what they want to do at midnight you know when they're out their golf carts drinking or whatever they're doing so i think jeremy's just trying to put a little light on there so it'd be more obvious because there are police officers i'm trying to stop their buzz george yeah literally literally stop thermos so i you know i will i'll ask patty and mike like what they think and maybe if you want to call him and talk to him after i do she wouldn't mind yeah if you just couldn't okay yeah i don't think a until solarwinds pm i don't think anyone cares or it's a problem you know i don't know if she's coming back well the only thing that patty said well they put up something but like the people fishing there would literally lean over into their fence and feed their dogs bait fish i would say if someone did that to me because i saw she raised her fence but she can't at the yeah and they still lean over the fence and try to feed her dogs or talk to her dogs or whatever and it's just like it comes from anyway so solar lights alas patty and the smoking thing but like here's just like you know there's nothing and like there's sprinklers in this park but the grass is completely dead so i don't know like some of the parks that i surveyed the grass was beautiful so it was like their sprinklers work and these sprinklers don't or these sprinklers aren't coming on um but the grass was you know not in good shape not in shape no and then here is see that whole section in that corner is just cracked off like you could literally i mean there's a huge that's it that's missing yes and that's the south end that's just the south corner only from that line north it's in good shape exactly it was done with the project yeah and then i noticed too and i don't know if we do this for environmental reasons but like even in the areas where there was a decent amount of shell coverage there's tons and tons of weeds so i don't know if they spray the weed killer or if we i don't know they can only have great killers so close to the water the water okay yeah i figured it might be something like that so it just needs to be more shells but that was really awful they weed whack it but they can and then yeah it would be more that just yeah because i can see if you weed whack the shells are flying everywhere yeah and then it's like it's tricky to keep it's tricky yeah okay so that's really all i have for south park um i don't think we resolve this southpaw problem have we what's the problem oh the people yeah i'll say that again they'll never be because it's they could park there and then there's the people out there park there and just walk into the park walk across yeah and then if they get kicked out of the park next to like paddy and mike's house they'll just go across the street and make more noise so yeah and what about fencing i mean could her pens be put up no there's like what do you mean like to shut the gate like yeah take it off at a certain time so they can't get there i mean ultimately that's what we want right yeah well and this is the other thing to nora's point across the street where there's public parking at brown park it literally says everywhere no smoking healthy lungs at play so they'll walk right across the street and do it in bella beach um well and plus they want to be on the water but if they're smoking they can't smoke across the street and so you know it's that park is lit where they can go across the street it's dark they can do what they want and there's nothing so i mean you can't bring your dog in there anymore so now no they change it back well they did yeah because it's still like still getting a ton of people like from indian rocks and their golf cart that's why there's no grass yeah i suppose there's a golf cart somewhere well they do i know yeah well so the fence would kind of yeah yeah um so yeah but those were the highlights for that one it's overall it's like it's not a pretty park like there's it's minimal like the biggest thing that stuck out to me of the five parks that i surveyed is the vast difference in how these parks look it's look it's like some of them are like beautiful and lush and so well maintained and then others look like the step child like oh we don't like this end of the street or we don't like this park or i don't know if it was donated like but they're maintained into different levels which i don't understand um this one this one versus what's the most when you did like bella this is beautiful hibiscus east is just yeah anyway i'll get to that one okay the little part i i guessed it three times before yeah i mean that is tiny it's tiny but there's no i'll get to that no i know okay so the next part that i did was south street or i'm sorry second street and the first thing that i noticed and i think i've done this before like this cap i mean the hole is like a foot deep and like it's so who i don't know what this is maintenance for but if someone falls in this or dog falls in this it's the valves for the variation yeah so it's so the cap doesn't there's capital on it the cap was on it like this and so all i did was touch it like this and then popped it yeah so it needs to be raised up it needs to be raised up because this is a definite like you know someone's gonna twist their ankle or whatever um so the utility cap is loose didn't we mess with this cap before because someone can you tell me something about a vlog well i every time it looks like this i take a picture and send it to you but it never gets like fixed okay because a lot of the caps are like you know they're on there they're sturdy they're if you step on them they're not going anywhere this one is just like it's almost like the cap is too small for the hole does that make sense yeah so like right that's why it's so like maybe we just put a bigger box over the whole thing instead of a little round one we get like a a square one yeah yeah that might be better the fences on both sides of this are in good shape and are well maintained um but the bushes in this park are really scruffy tons of weeds um the shells are you know missing the grass is kind of like you know there's big patches of dead grass so again there's a sprinkler system but i don't know what the settings are on because it's real patchy and um okay and the the sidewalk's in pretty good shape the seawall is in good shape um the bench and then um i don't know if it just happened to be the day that i was surveying but i'm in this part quite a bit like the last time we did this we added the signs it says please be considerate and clean up your fish mess and they were really clean it was in good shape so i don't know if it's you know i'm sure randomly it's not in good shape but like the day i surveyed it hopefully those signs are healthy they must be helping yeah so it was good a lot of people had them during the summer i'm sure they were overwhelmed they recently pressure washed the sidewalks this is one of the ones where the guy across the street lets us use his water oh yeah the sidewalks looks look at this compared to well you see this because they might have pressure oh yeah so the dock looked like it and then um yeah so overall other than just a little tlc this park is in good shape um the next park that i did is 16th street this park um the grass looks great so it's like there was no big brown patches but there is zero landscaping there's quite a few trees and it's not like it just needs something there's nothing there so i don't know if it's was done for a reason but it could use a little yeah i don't know the storyline landscaping around the trees and i don't know what this utility pole is i don't know if like someone hit it that's that's because they're doing work over there it's completely it was their utilities run through that part of the right away so like their sewer and everything they had to dig it up and we had to get them to replace the grass so that's like their laterals for utilities and i don't know what why is it like we can find out what this is they put something in the underground is something a conduit and they just left it and i don't know what it's supposed to be for so that needs to be corrected that's that that's part of their whatever they're doing okay um they're just having finished it and you're talking about the neighbors that's the house next door oh okay um i don't know what they're right that's for uh for communication or what that means i don't think it's pink what happened to the north yeah are we on the 16th street yeah so you can see their construction in the picture yeah yeah yeah so i just just because i didn't know if like someone hit it with a car you know what i mean like a no that was put in it was put in sideways like that but yeah well they put the conduit undergrounded it and they left a piece out because they can locate it and feed it okay put it under with a box or something like that so like you know here around the garbage can again there's no like shells or anything but like it's all dead around it it looks kind of i think so you guys have the shells it would be nice if they would put at least there yeah um and like here like the shells look good like along the sea wall and they're not real weedy so that's good and they have a nice little sign that says pick up after your dog which and they put a lot of effort because that's that's the sea wall that's got a lot of wash out so underneath yeah it's constantly yeah it you there's so much in there like material and things to just try and keep it from washing through that sea wall because that's one of the ones we're replacing oh see but if you visually look at it it looks good like there's no cracks like it looks um but if with the ties down take a look at the actual wall oh yeah that's pretty bad there's a lot okay material coming that's the one i did last year and that's one that had little sinkholes in front of it yeah so they put a lot of effort into keeping those sinkholes from forming just to keep it level and that's like if the tides behind the sea wall yeah and it's been in bad shape on the north end it's broken off gotcha um but the dock looked decent like i didn't really see anything yeah going on with that so the only that's one of those dollars that used to have the setup launch yeah and it broke and it gotcha that's broke neighborhood complaint there oh yeah yeah well i wasn't really because you know obviously second street too people have asked multiple times for a kayak launch you know what i mean i could bring that up 100 times until it gets on the pecking order yeah i mean you know it kind of is what it is um so the next one that i did was belle isle which this park is beautiful so i don't know like if it it does look like there were some things in it that were donated because they have two benches and on one of them it's like dedicated to somebody but um the grass is beautiful the landscaping is beautiful like all the bushes and like all of the landscaping along both fences from either property line all in really good shape the seawall looks decent um i don't know overall like i'm pretty sure i've been to most of the parks this one's by far the prettiest but like even this one could use some shell i know you don't want to do weed cleaner but this one too could use some that one could get sprayed because it's for it's far enough away yeah and like this like i'm sure at some point there were shells around the garbage can that are all gone um but when you like look at it overall like you know like i said the bushes everything is just really pretty um and then like i said somebody must have donated a second bench or did something because there was a little plaque and it's really the only plaque i've seen on any of the benches here so we got a new bench coming forward that was donated um it's going to go up morgan oh nice um i guess the woman's parents lived here for a long time and they recently passed and she took some of their money and wanted to donate a bench and put it oh that's awesome she just wanted it near the beach so we picked morgan perfect it's gonna be like the benches out here those ones they hold up really well they got that plastic coating around the outside of them the gray ones the ones that say bella beach yeah yeah the same dollar beach the custom ones but those hold up pretty well yeah oh nice because that one down at crossing is very old compared to these and it's they're not that far off yeah you can't tell a difference oh that's good um both neighbors on both sides of this park um do a good job maintaining their fences so that's good and then the last thing i did was hibiscus park east like you said i drove past it it kind of looks like an empty lot like i didn't know it was a park it took me a minute and then i saw the sign and i was like oh that's the mini park there is no sidewalk in this one at all the bench the garbage can the utility caps are in good shape one side of the fence um is in great shape the other side is really overgrown and where you know it's rotted and like it's coming through and everything's dead but i'm pretty sure it looked exactly that way the last time we did this i want to check with steve but i've i've told code enforcement about that because it's that's that's the side yeah i know i know it's not okay okay um yeah landshaping uh the grass all that looks good um the only thing i noticed on this one is the sea wall or is this sea wall getting replaced or no probably not no it's uh nora had that park last year it's got a crack um but the engineer looked at at the time thought you know it it needs to be replaced but we had some some lifetime in it it wasn't failing got you guys it's not aesthetically it's got a little crack on it yeah it's got like two cracks yeah kind of going down the middle but it's holding the other is what was determined but like down by the water and the bench like the shells look great there's no weeds like as far as that goes like this part was really good for that so some of the other ones you know don't but like if you look at the top like i got i think if you um i got it right here which one that yeah i'm not sure if you cut down all that stuff that's overgrown and dead if that fence would even stay up yeah i don't want to check inside the neighbor has his door opening up yeah in the park yeah yeah it's the same yeah so that's all i have that's the last thing that steve has on that because it's it's in the code to do you have to maintain your offense and when it gets like that well we have a new code enforcement guys no he's good at work so yeah he's good um yeah but that's all i had for the most part it's just the thing like i said that stuck out to me is like the the difference between the parks and how some of them are in really great shape and others are not in such great shape and like if we can maybe give a little tlc to the ones that aren't a little um neglected yeah i mean let's just spruce it up where we can spruce up some of the grass um it could be just the the exposure it's getting the um how great the irrigation is actually working in the park yeah that i know at south park it gets a lot of sunlight most of the day in the summer months it dries up very easily um so we really have to crank that irrigation to run it for long periods of time just to keep yeah yeah it's like some of them have sidewalks and some of them don't and i didn't know why again i don't know what the design of some of these most of them were just donated and i don't know the years maybe i know they went through them a couple years ago as far as the deeds and all that it'd be interesting to put together a timeline of when these parts were first developed okay um but i again i don't know what determined the landscaping my trees in a certain spot or why some of them have tons of landscaping they just put a lot more design work into like belle isle i don't know i think it was budget and timing well it could have been like i know that was donated could it have had some of the landscaping on it previously when it was donated or do you think the city did all the landscaping in all of them i'm guessing they did some i don't i don't know the conditions of what the lot was i could have demoed something right but i do know that they did have sort of like a master landscaping plan it was like early 2000s that they kind of went through and and and added some things in different parts i can look through like what because i haven't i found that my office i could see kind of what was involved in some of these parks and maybe i have a lot of reasoning yeah i don't think the parks and rec committee was involved those are just my notes if you want them okay i didn't email them um is it the same stuff that was in the uh some of it not all of it okay and then my question kyle like so for like are you gonna go through all this and decide what goes on this yeah i gotta go through it all and get it all on our list and then um obviously i'm gonna take care of what can be taken care of quickly versus what it's gonna take more time but i want to get on the list so that we're tracking this right now yeah i was going to ask you do you like is this something that we is there something we can help you with or is it easier for you to just look at our notes and write it in i think i'm just going to go one by one through everything because i got you know there's some things that you said you know looks good look good so i just gotta you know i didn't really i honestly i did not look at it much of it before this meeting because i figured that we just go through it all so now that you guys went through and did the explanations i'll just go through each one and add it all and see where we end up on how much how much is quick fixes versus what can be done maybe in six months versus what needs to be budgeted yeah that's good and could you do um no rush like the next meeting or the meeting after that however long it takes you can we just um can we see it when you're done yeah okay yeah of course i mean just out of curiosity no no i'll give you guys copies okay awesome does anybody have anything else thank you everyone for doing those like it's good that we have eyes and you know pictures and you know it's and i know that the main you know they're out there all the time and for the most part everything looks good and you know like none of them is being completely neglected like no one ever shows up and does anything but it's just like extra eyes on everything and yeah you know like nora may have caught something that i didn't catch at you know belle isle you know what i mean so it's just good because you know everybody sees things differently so and it's good that we take pictures and it's a good exercise you're proactively out there i mean we'll when we get someone tell us about something that needs to be fixed um you know we fix it but you guys are going out there and you know looking for issues versus what could possibly be an issue in the future and that's yeah that's a step before does anyone call about the walkway that little walkway that's basically oh like the the ladies in it that little vodka um no no it went from the shell idea to asphalt now and i know that there are two sides to that so it's still being like saved for now eventually it's going to come to the point where we're looking to move forward with it and i don't know if at that point there's going to be people that want to speak out about not doing it do they have a year like they think oh we'll have enough money in 2024 um i was just curious if like there was a time frame where like they wanted it to be done by x day no they there was talk though um they may when they do the next project um when the equipment's out there to to utilize you know the paving equipment and the contractor that's out there to do it in sections as you move up so the next project is going to be that 12th or 13th stormwater project so once that gets moving forward that is going to be considered of doing from 13th to 14th okay because you might as well do it while they're out there yeah and build it and you're finding it from a different source but it's saving money okay awesome does anybody have anything else with this all right great thank you for doing those okay the next item on the agenda number seven is our event at the end of the month april 30th fly me to the moon 4 30 to 7 30. um i think we're pretty much set with everything as far as what we can do this far out so like the music is set up food the italian food truck is set up kyle has the signs made that are going to go out throughout the city on monday it's been on a sign it's on the website patty sent out a constant contact blast today i don't know if you guys saw it in your email um that just had a little bit more information but how many people did we have on constant contact kyle like 350 or something like that yeah it goes the new list that sounds right but i'll check yeah so we are pretty much set up like all the like we ordered a few italian decorations um so those are in we pretty much have everything that we need um we are going to um i called publix today and spoke to the manager and they said then they needed to least know by monday before but i'll do two weeks so to go and order up those mini cannolis and pay for them okay so what we're saying on next monday okay and i'm pretty sure the last meeting like kyle went over those nylon bags that we were going to do giveaway were like four dollars a piece and we just can't do it so instead we couldn't find the italian ice vendor was unavailable and we couldn't find anybody else to do dessert so we decided on giving out the mini cannolis and we're gonna turn it into like lynn's you know we're gonna do a retirement table for lynn and so like the cannolis will be like the cake and like we we have a couple things he wants it real small he doesn't want it to be made a big deal but he will be there and it'll be his last event as the city manager so we'll do a little thing for him and like maybe say a couple of words at the band break um but like we'll tie the cannoli giveaway into his that whole thing um and then we're going to meet the friday before like we normally do and set up as much as we can and then on that saturday the event starts at 4 30 so we can probably be here at 3 30. um and the band's probably going to want to be here an hour beforehand so i would say 3 3 30 3 3 o'clock yeah and i'll be here before that so i'll do pick up for the cannolis like maybe even earlier than that yeah and i know you're gonna get the water and the ice and we can have that all set up um and what are we doing for our uh how much water we're planning on 200 200 yeah that's our number okay yeah i would say 200. so everyone arrived at three three thirty somewhere three three three o'clock yeah i think earlier yeah and the friday before it was two like it normally is okay so friday the 29th is two o'clock and saturday the 30th is three o'clock and then um kyle booked the um sheriff's department the security yes that got put in this week and then um i think that was it like everything else on my list um that i had to talk to kyle about he did so the sign security order the cannoli and then yeah like i said all the decorations all that stuff we're in um kyle and nicole went and placed a new um t-shirt order so we have inventory we have beach towels we already sold two men's shirts really because i've been actually like saving them for the event but they they're coming out a little more this morning so if they come specifically laura comes and gets him so okay yeah so that's good um so is there anything that anybody else could think of i think we're pretty much set with this um the only thing i think i haven't seen if lynn added the pricing of the italian food vendor to the website i know it wasn't on the email blast it just said i'm sorry patty it what he sells but it didn't say that it's you know check on that yeah well you know maybe she just sends it to me and she doesn't put it on no i can't no i got it okay i'm just not on it there's a form that you have to fill out and if you don't fill out the form you don't get it um all right that's funny that's good so you didn't get any of the political blasts because you weren't on the consequence no i didn't no i didn't okay so that's why i afford it to me okay slowly there you go it's a good time to sign up for it yeah we'll have a little leave the diamond teeth cannolis on but is there anything else that anybody can think of it should be pretty easy we already went through it with jazz and not a whole lot change so if we have everything in house um we're not hanging the stuff from the so there will be no so what are we setting up at 2 00 pm on friday we're doing the gift bags with all of the we have 100 gift bags to put together and then we're going to set up the tables with the tablecloths and put them in the room so all we have to do is walk them outside so yeah so on saturday hopefully we're not running around sweating or yeah yeah everything is just like a nice easy setup yeah oh we need to have kyle make a note to have a money bag and change right and then trying to think like last time i think like we were like oh we should have said something it's um 3 57 right that now emailed 357. i was close then okay oh kyle the only other thing that we thought it was just and i'm sure you would remember anyway that we need a money bag with change for that day yep for merchandise sales for merchandise sales yeah okay and we have two tents so we'll have to put those up that day and then we have all the recycle the first aid the garbage cans um we pretty much know where things need to be placed because remember last year we were it was like 27 times we know where things go and where they work best yeah um yeah i think it should be i'm going to call the band one more time just to make sure they're going to be here at like 3 30 and you know check the box on that but they're reliable obviously and anything else how what what we do have decorations yep um they're not as crazy individual things like last time think of your kids yeah so yeah i don't think we'll need ladders we won't be date you know there's we have italian flags and we have some banners that we can hang we got like those strings yeah so that's really we'll hang those along the front and then we got for the merchandise section like last time we had um like i can't remember what color but this time we got red and green we got italian colors for the clips for the merchandise samples and then like you know i have three red and white checkered italian tablecloths so we'll do those over certain tables and that's it i mean it should be pretty straightforward and if we haven't thought of it we could take care of it friday or that saturday and hopefully like the goal is that we get um like double the amount of residents so last year we had a hundred so this year hopefully we get around 200. so that's hopefully i mean the more the merrier but hopefully more people come so we'll see how it goes does anybody have anything else with that okay cool um item number eight so this one kind of went but like so technically if you look at our events so this one on april 30th is in this year's fiscal budget and all the rest of them fall into next year's fiscal budget because we moved jazz to november from september so um our new mayor requested that we have a chili cook-off in september and so i'll let kyle kind of take it from there i did send him a text today saying for certain reasons it can't be a city-sponsored event and i'll let kyle kind of explain it well i think when the idea because we got a little more details is to have residents bringing their chili from what they prepared at their houses that would be given out to the public and then there was a question of you know what is that safe to do and you know what happens if somebody brings chili that has something in it that contaminates and gets people sick the bellar foundation community foundation that's it and i talked to them and they what did what she told me was that they they have a free everything event so they do like the corn hole and they do the chili and and everybody brings it and it just is it just let it it's like a free-for-all i guess where people give it up to who they want to and but we were more concerned because we're not one of those type of organizations that um just for liabilities sake we just didn't want to be providing food to the public from from people that weren't licensed vendors that follow health date safety inspections and didn't you say something about the health department the fact that we don't have a kitchen department and they and i kind of just like went through my thought process with them and they were in agreement with the idea that it could be a problem it's not a a safe way to go to have somebody um bring just people bringing things serving it to the public um they were you know we were kind of just thinking about it and they were they said that you know they there's there's temporary permits for events um for public food events but usually there's set guidelines um where you you either have them prepare the food on site there's just certain measures that they're taking to make sure that the public gets sick it's a smaller chance of something being prepared wrong so i don't know it just i couldn't find any examples of city sponsored events um the only things i was finding when i was searching in ashland were there there was a chili cook-off it was either the they had local restaurant vendors that already had food like that either competing in that nature or food truck drivers that are you know obviously they serve in the public or if lynn and i were talking when we did do it in oldsmar um it was a judged event for people who brought their own chili but the public did not get that chili it was just judges that so it was like a little competition yeah but the the only chili that was given to the public was provided by the city which was just canned chili with coffee no beans yeah that was it but so there were certain rules followed because again you don't want to have someone giving out chili that we're sponsoring the event and then a bunch of people get sick from that show because we don't know what they're doing yeah but at the end of the day if like tammy lavender beller beach resident or dave gaddis beller beach resident wants to rent out city hall however that would look and have a private party then the city's not liable because the city's not involved which means the park and record isn't doing it it's a private event and if it's a private event it's no different than you having a party at your house um so i i did just i didn't call dave because i know he works during the day i just sent him a text saying you know the health department you know and he he sent me something back and said he's going to think about it so i don't know um where that's going to land but it's going to land right there exactly what we just said that's his it sounds like like if he wants to do his own personal party yeah and he has all those you know information so you can fight all of his personal yeah so i mean that's kind of like we're gonna leave that and you know but and then kyle and i have kind of been talking about and of course you know me are like boo you know um let's you know i was kind of discussing with him having an event right around the same time frame of like a dinner dance and we sell tickets so like you know have a catered dinner have um like a cocktail hour or like you know wine and beer have music have dinner and have dancing from like six to ten um so i kind of priced out some things we would be looking at like say it's 7 500 so it would be like 65 a ticket and then you get a sit-down dinner wine and beer and entertainment for four hours and i don't know if that's something that we want to undertake i don't really think it would be it wouldn't be us serving it wouldn't be us bartending it wouldn't be us you know what i mean like having people do that would be set in the cost of the ticket so if we went we would pay for our tickets and we would enjoy it with our significant others um like all of the things that we would do would be beforehand but that may not be something that we want to bite off and then so i but i'm bringing it up to just say we have money in the 20 21 22 fiscal budget because everything else we have for the rest of the year meaning halloween jazz and christmas fall into next year's budget so i just want to kind of check with you guys and see if we cause i kind of wanted to present the three main events and then possibly one other one to city council in may so they can vote on everything at once and people would know well in advance what's on the park and rec board calendar and they could look at the website and say hey you know we've got a few things and obviously we did these last year so hopefully people will kind of be like hey i wonder if they're going to do that again so i don't know i'm just opening up for discussion for a september event through the park and rec board if you guys want to do another one because we have money in our budget um and we have an opening and but we didn't do jazz because it's so hot outside so like we could do something later in the evening we could do something inside i don't know i'm just throwing stuff out there and i don't expect you to come up with like you know whole game plan but like um just if you've thought in the past of anything that might be like hey this might be work or that you know good or this might be fun because right now we're doing pretty much like um what's the word you know what i mean we're doing pretty like if you look at other people's city calendars around like we're doing things that a lot of other people are doing so it's like if we wanted to do something that's like unique to us or what do you guys think about the dinner dance idea like to just yay nay too much because that doesn't come out of our budget at all though like the way i mean i guess it could if we had some money but if you don't sell enough tickets it will well this is a thing if we don't sell like say capacity is 70 couples um so 140 people is what fits in that room the caterer does it by person so we have a maximum we would have to set a minimum and kind of what i was thinking was we opened it up to bellar beach residents only for the first two months of ticket sales and then if we have no takers then it's bella beach residents and guests so it's like if you want to invite you know your neighbor that lives in you know wherever reddington or your you know your family who's in town visiting we just want to make sure that bellar beach residents would get the ticket opportunity first and then if we don't have takers and we're not to the minimum then you know we could open it up too but you have to have a guest you have to have somebody that like and because we would do more like family style we would have a seating arrangement and like you would be sitting with all people that you know and it would be plated salad and then family style like entree side dishes starch whatever and then because if you do plated everything because you have to rent every single dish every single fork all of that to have individual plated hand it to each person individually like we'll make the cost go through the roof and obviously a buffet is easier but buffets suck and i mean i don't like who wants to get dressed up and then go stand in the buffet line i don't i'd rather not like so family style if you're with a table of people that you know and you knew you were coming and you know what the you know it's like oh the eight of us want to sit together then you have no problem passing this chicken or the salmon or whatever over to your what if you're not though what if you're not it just is what it is then you're just sharing i mean it's not like people are picking up food with their fingers you're you know there's going to be serving utensils so i mean it would be no different from a buffet at that point like if you're sitting with it like if only you and your significant other coming and you don't know anybody and you're just sitting at a random table then it would be no different than a buffet because they're still like you know what i mean you're picking it off of so i don't know maybe we just take the three that we already have down and we've already done to city council in may and we think about it for a bit and does anybody have any thoughts on it now i think it's going to be a huge undertaking on doing it i don't know how many people we're going to get on it yeah i mean we never know for anything how many people are going to get but this is a ticket you know yeah it's a kind of bigger price tag i think some people are willing to yeah yeah yeah there is a cost involved where everything else we do is free but you know you are getting a sit-down meal and alcohol and entertainment and you can't get that anywhere else for and the caterer that i looked at literally caters for the city of largo they cater for three professional baseball teams they've been in business they're very well established and they're like you can sample out what you want so we know that like the food is and you know i asked her i'm like you know how do you keep the food hot i want to make sure that from your kitchen to the table that you know like we we went to an event at bell or country club and it was outside and it was um they served everybody individually those plates had been sitting in the kitchen for two hours they were cold and it's like i didn't eat anything my husband ate all of it but you know i'm saying like it was just i i i want the food to be hot as it comes to the table so i went through all of those questions with her um like to make sure that they have chafing dishes and they take it right from the chafing dish to the serving platter to the table and um i think she said for a party at maximum five they would have five wait staff and then we would have two bartenders but the thing is with her their minimum is 10 people we would never do that for 10 people but if we have less people the cost goes down so but we kind of do well i guess the cos the overall cost goes down but the cost per ticket doesn't go down so yeah it would be and it would be a first because i mean i don't know you've lived here a long time have we had anything like that here not that i can bring this i mean i do i don't know i mean a lot has been done yeah yeah it may have been i don't know a lot of things here yeah pivotal yeah i mean and i thought like when you mentioned chili cook-off i thought that that would actually like i was like okay well that would be better because it's easier everybody just brings their pot of chili but like we can't do that as a park and rec board event um for said reason so like i just thought we have the budget we have a time frame if we want to do something else we can if we don't i know our budget doesn't roll over though so if we don't use it we lose it and i don't lose it where does it go where it is just it goes into the next year's budget it's just but it doesn't go into like your specific budget yeah the city obviously keeps out the money they just spend it so i think it's reallocated yeah i guess or whatever's not allocated it goes into our reserves on dedicated reserves so but if we had as a parking report if we had money left over in our budget could we say oh well we request to put a kayak launch at second street can we do that oh okay now your budget is for your yeah where you use it well i mean honestly it's like i acted though yeah it is connected is it specifically i don't think is it specifically for events no it says it says promotional events that's what your budget is okay well i think i i don't want to lose it i think we should use it anything was to get uh upgraded or maintained in a park there's a separate public works budget that comes out of how much money are you talking about three thousand dollars most of it because um i want to say that the april event is about what is it twelve hundred dollars um maybe you got fifteen fifty okay so it's fifteen hundred dollars so yeah minus the raffle yeah it's probably a little less yeah this is our old one and we're not doing the sports packs we're doing the cannolis so like uh that's cheap 650 less so maybe that's where i got that we can always just do like i don't know something in september like like a happy hour thing if we can't like swing for all the food i'm not just saying jules brought up something um where they had like a sunset social or something that might be fun like which would you know it's just a different name for a happy hour um we could i mean kyle's already done all the research on getting a temporary license and insurance and that's about six hundred dollars um yeah so we can definitely work license is cheap our uh sun sun painting a whole lot of fun yeah well we don't pay you doesn't mean there's exactly anything yeah and this is a thing i have put that out there or we have three times and two of them we had to cancel because no one signed up so it's kind of like one of those things was it expensive we paid i want to say 29 a person or something like that no it's not expensive not for three hours and he supplies everything yeah we could definitely get that on the schedule again that's fun i think it's going to be the same people doing do you want to try again i can just call them and get a date what do you guys think i mean it doesn't really affect anything i like the cocktail hour though i was just oh those are yeah completely separate i'll call him about a painting class yeah i like the cocktail hour thing i like that i feel like more people go to it to differences will get a lot less we'll use some of that money you know so you're still getting tickets and then you're gonna you have to do tickets i don't know i'm just asking how you know we'll see you don't have to no because i mean if it's small plates and like yeah isn't the drinks they pay per person no because the bart like if we get a liquor license for a temporary event and our own insurance we don't need to get it from anybody else so we can buy the booze buy the wine and beer and which will save a ton of money yeah it doesn't have to be a full bar you can just have like one years or wine and beer your tacos whatever you want to do you know it could just be like a one or the other or the you know once you start getting into the one thing i think about us just making sure because it all has to be written out how you're gonna everyone needs to be id'd and you know wrist standing so there's a little bit of leg work in it but we can do it at twilight hour or something i don't know we could just call it something different but yeah because it's so hot we would probably do it here as opposed to outside and just call it twilight or happy hour something like that sunset's fine it just that was the image i got no i know i got this yeah i started yeah that's all it was if we were gonna do it here so like a five to seven and then people could still go out to dinner if they wanted to after is that what you're thinking like that would be happy hour yeah whatever is like i just thought it would be something like on a little smaller scale so that we can what is sunset it's 8 30 in the summer or not september shortly right it's right around eight remember because it was pitch dark like when they were cleaning off at eight what were we expecting the same numbers it's kind of that's a tricky one to plan because we're buying we almost need to sell tickets for even 10 bucks to see how many people were getting that that would help yeah that works which it says because it yeah it's tough when you don't know who's coming how do you plan for the exact amount you don't want too much surplus in me and then you don't want to not enough either yeah so yeah so it is better yeah when you think about it like that to do tickets when do we have to have a answer for this i mean we're talking about different options now do we have time to sure yeah planned out so then you can present it to get it approved we don't have to have every detail planned of we just we could add it to the list to just say we in september we want to have we need the only thing that we would have to come up with is the name and um well they're not going to approve it unless you have it pretty well planned out well no but i mean we can we can plug in the little boxes on that you know what i mean on this and because i already have all the estimates from the bar and the caterer all we'd be doing i mean if you go to her website it'll say appetizers blue blue blue and we could just totally shrink this where's my because i oh here it is this is what we would present to city council if we did the big seven or eight thousand dollar all we would do is change sit down dinner to you know what i mean like that number would shrink considerably and um we'd still have to have security the bar is the same um yeah we would still have to rent the glassware in like small plates we wouldn't have to rent all the silverware and tablecloths it would be more like we don't have cocktail tables do we like you know those tall round things yeah or can we just have like a social gathering or something yeah yeah but it's just like it's nice when people have a plate of food and a glass that they have a high table to set it down on so they can eat and and put their glass or whatever down um but we could do those on low tables too because that's what i mean it depends what level you're talking because it because you're still kind of talking a little fancy i don't know what everybody else was envisioning because i thought i'm just asking like a level like of like what we're serving i was trying to figure out yeah because like just as you mentioned cocktail tables awesome like yeah i thought well no i would just say if like you know like nicole's idea about the chicutery boards if someone has their little cheese plate and their grapes and their glass of wine then they and they're talking okay i've got a name for this event date night wine and cheese that's cute i like it it's casual but not real casual but yeah just a simple daylight one cheese but it's set up in here but obviously it's in and out what will we charge 15 a person or a tenant person well okay so this is the thing like what i can do is i can go on the caterers website because the for the full meal it was 25 a person so obviously that's gonna shrink way down so i would um look and see just like a if you picked a smattering of appetizers if it's ten dollars per person and then we get all the pricing situated and then see what we have twenty five hundred dollars in the budget and then we would offset if we were a little bit short in the budget by the ticket sales so i would say ten bucks right like we talked about before if it goes over what you have in your budget you got to get an adjustment right yeah does that make sense so yeah it would probably be 10 or 15 a person 10 would be great because that i mean i think that just yeah yeah that would be good are you good with that yeah okay and okay and i don't it doesn't i'm not trying to make it sound fancy but i just what are you picturing what do you think you're picturing that i'm picturing differently me well i'm just thinking like uh do these cocktail tables are you planning on running them well no i just asked if we had them since we don't have them we'll just use what we have yeah okay i just figured we'll have like one table for like people can come up for the beer mine and then the other table with like the cheeses and like the meat like whatever and then like kind of like a buffet but not really like yeah but it's not a dinner so it's fine that it's you know yes and people could just come and grab what they want and then it's like kind of like a social thing and then they can talk to whoever they want vegetables yeah whatever like the plates are that they normally have and then i mean we can probably even get like the plastic stuff cheap if it doesn't come with it it's like that appetizer table look like weddings yeah and we don't have to rent plates we can get plastic plates that's fine but i i would like to not wear glassware with the people serving from their bar i wouldn't i would i would report anything like to get glasses they're taking their container they're taking our purchased alcohol and then pour it into a glass yes and it would be like a red and a white wine and then a domestic and an import or something this is why i asked how much time we have we don't have to plan out all the details now we just have to get some numbers to present ikea has and like on bigger scales and like inside my house and i just went to ikea and i knocked out i mean there were like two books yes yes you know so i had several glasses going ahead whatever it was they were really inexpensive and they looked really nice they're a dollar a piece to rent they're yeah oh yeah and that's totally fine because what we talked about is like yeah if you buy them because they're cheaper so that's what i did there's no tissues i had a really tall kitchen and i just put them all on top of where people you know and that's where i stored them yeah and it worked but i wouldn't you guys probably don't want them in boxes but they actually come in like like a moving box you know and you just it's a matter of no dishwasher and yeah so it's like what we talked about on one of the websites that i looked at to rent a tablecloth was 27 to buy a tablecloth is eleven like that would be an easy wash dry and shove in a garbage bag and you tied it up until the next time we can use it like so we won't rent things that are cheaper to buy that we can store but the glassware is hard plus you got to clean it but like i really don't want to do plastic wine glasses if we can if we can afford it i mean plastic appetizer plates are okay yeah and then if you're renting it too it's on them to have clean glasses yeah all you do is shove the glasses back in the box dirty and they pick them up yeah and that's kind of worth especially if it's a small scale and even if we get 200 people that we don't have to have wine glasses and water glasses we don't have to have like multiple kinds of glasses we don't have to have silverware we don't have to have linen napkins we can have like just cocktail napkins so it'll be way less expensive than what i was looking at because it was either going to be all that way or all that i think this is a little bit more inviting i think the price tag will be friendlier more people will feel less of a commitment of like getting super tall you know i mean and being there on time they can kind of come and go well and the other thing is we see the response without like dedicating it like to something where you have to buy a ticket in advance because we're still going to have to let kyle said we have to give the caterer number by a certain day we have to know how many people are coming so we know how much like wine and beer to buy and how much supplies we need blah blah i think it'll cost more than ten dollars a person but we have that budget to cover yeah i think that'd be nice yeah so it would be kind of like they're ten dollars pays for a portion of it but like the rest of it is kind of like it's not the rest and it's a low enough number that i think nobody's worried about you know yeah spending 10 bucks to go by and say hi yeah yeah also put they put a little stake into it so you get your idea of who's interested in that's the key you know it's good you have a commitment it's none it's a little bit more solid unless you're on your death bed and we have a doctor's note on why you can't make it yeah okay no that's great i like it wine cheese green oh this is great it's fruity yeah yeah actually just kind of hummus whatever people like yeah sure no that's perfect all right you kind of make a nail out of it so what i'm going to do is i will type up one of these adjust give it to kyle and then he'll send it to you guys and then you can make little notes if you want to like suggestions hey how about not this or that and then we can kind of do it that way as opposed to having another meeting um for this event yeah is that good because you want to have this all set kind of uh by next month yes for the may things so we could present all four events as opposed to piecemealing doing three of them and then going back and going oh yeah we want to have one before that um and then i would explain that they know that like the three events go towards next year and this is would be the second event in this year's budget um this is may 2nd and today is what the 13th is that okay with you guys if i plug i'll type it up plug it in and have kyle email it out to you and we can kind of just have email discussions from there absolutely okay awesome all right does anybody have anything else that they want to add to that number eight item no okay perfect number nine okay this is just two seconds our sponsorship for like for our events so it's not so much this part that we put together that needs to be worked on by the city attorney what it is is like say i don't know bellar dental wants to do a 750 sponsorship what they had before was a three-page contract and i guess it was real real wordy and so that's what's still with the city attorney because they're trying to condense that down to one page so it doesn't scare people off because it was just a lot so like hopefully that's going to be also presented at the may meeting and then we can start shooting this out to people and hopefully get some sponsors for some of these events but even if we do get a sponsor for say like wine and cheese date night we still have to sell the tickets so we know how many people because people aren't going to rsvp in advance because they're going to wait and see what's going on how they feel but like if we sell the tickets we're going to buy to accommodate that number and again we have a maximum capacity in that room we have to decide what the minimum is whether it's i mean we see what 100 people looks like outside that room only holds 140 so i would say if we get 60 70 people that would be enough to make it look like it's busy in there um but we have to set a minimum yeah of people that buy tickets in advance is that cool okay so then if we hit the main room if we don't then we just i'm sorry cancel what you're saying well i mean say if we only get if we worst case scenario we sell 20 tickets i mean i would pretty much say we have to cancel and refund the money because we can't do it for 20 people you know whatever our minimum is but like 20 people in that room you kind of feel like you're swallowed you know what i mean we would have to we could section the room off in half you've got those big dividers but i don't know if we want to do that no that sounds it's 20 people are moving into your house right yeah you want to have all the numbers worked out and then have these questions thought out because they'll buy ass yeah okay it just sucks that we won't be able to present until may because literally we will have the people here april 30th to be like hey we're hosting this or at least let them know you know what i'm saying like we'll have like say even if only like 50 well we're not saying that 100 people show up like at least they would be aware of the next event because sometimes tell them what you're planning yeah i guess maybe we'll just like have a little sign or whatever email this yeah maybe we could say oh you know we're hoping to have an event september 24th so if we say we're hoping look to the city website for details we can do that okay sure because if we already have the people here because like it's kind of hard like the facebook group has like hardly anybody and like next door is just no one right besides them tell them what you're thinking and then get them on the email list okay because then there would be a link for them to click to pay and right or they have to come here to pay because then again we have people that work that can't get here before city hall closes it would be great if we had a link to payon i don't know if we're gonna have a link because we just don't have a paying system like that yeah you have to pay for that so we still could process taste through email if they're willing to mail mail the check what about what about venmo or zell i'd have to deal with finance to see what could be set up yeah i mean she might be able to do we do have a way we invoice there's a little bit of a processing fee but that we had that anyone pays for the credit card but um with quickbooks we can send invoices that people can pay through links oh yeah so that's the finance thing how we could set it up or paypal tomorrow or what you can do is like we can have people email if they want to come and they put their name and how many and then yeah their email their name and then many guests and then we invoice them and be like we will send the invoice to your this email you provided just use regular mail too but then you have to do stamps and well i'm just saying if somebody if it's if we send out a piece of paper yeah it has the information on it then you just put a check in drop it off the front desk or just send it back with a stamp 50 cent stamp yeah that works okay well they said i'll think about what you know what we want to offer and you could have will call too well i think we're getting ahead of ourselves for tickets right now yeah what i've learned sorry no we're just we just started with like we should just at least somewhat say something on our like april 30th event like hey we're thinking about doing this event yeah just so people are aware that was awesome yeah as long as you guys are okay with it i don't know see why um but anyway so if we do have a sponsor for any one of these events i'm hoping that the city attorney is done going through like the details of the contract and has condensed it and we would also present that so we could start sending it out to like um duke energy or waste management or just some of the bigger like companies that already work in the city um and just you know start there and then work our way down where it's just like an email we're not like physically beating on doors of random businesses across the bridge going hey do you want to sponsor your aware of our program yeah exactly so hopefully we have that i'm going to call tomorrow and see where we are with that um yeah number 10 is basically just what i said so may proposal to the city council for the entire 2022 event schedule so hopefully we have all four things together that can be presented and voted on and then item number 11 on the agenda um so the bellar beach community foundation research update like i know it's a separate entity but it keeps coming up through our board or whatever so we are making progress on that um so um i don't know if you have any questions about it i don't know does anybody here want to be on that board or want to like say i want to be part of that or like there's options to be on the board and there's options to just be a member so um the non-for profit oh the whole thing that you did the research on like a year ago so i think i have people that want to be on the board so like if you guys want to just be like i don't i you know maybe just want to be a member once it's set up or something like that i just wanted to ask um since we've been talking about it for so long so because otherwise it's nothing really that i need to you know update here it will be updated more in the bigger picture working together you know it ties in a little yeah like if if someone like if the the community foundation wanted to you know someone wanted to donate a bench it wouldn't go through us it would go through him oh do you know what i'm saying like we wouldn't have any say if that entity wanted to do an event or you know if they say they wanted to do the chili cook offer like if you look at bel air's website they do the halloween event with the dog they did dog and donuts like a month ago or something like that they did the chili cookoff they did the car event i don't even know if they have a park and rack department and how they differentiate they're so much bigger than us that i'm sure that their their park and rec board has enough responsibilities without doing any events um is my guess they do a lot of sports oh they do oh yeah football league songs so they're recreational basketball league got it so uh yeah we don't do any of that obviously so we're kind of now a combination of their park and rec board and their community foundation but we're not non-for-profit and they get away with a lot more than we can do as a city entity um i would be interested are you going are you doing it i think so just because like i don't you know it's gone yeah you know step [Music] you need um president vice president they have like a director a membership coordinator belair oh yeah so um and there has been some interest in people volunteering and i do have a couple people that i'm going to be knocking on doors to say hey do you want to help with this so um okay but i just wanted to let you know that that is not dead that is that has had life breathed back into it and we're making progress um so it may be something like you know we don't know how long it takes to um like once you fill out the paperwork and stuff like that you send it to i'm assuming it's tallahassee like it could take three weeks or it could take six months we have no idea how long it takes to get the ball rolling so heard a long time but we're not sure yeah we'll just find out i don't know but anyway i just want to let everybody know that that is not that's not dead um i guess unless we call him and i think if we as a park and rec board have anything to do with them it would go through kyle like i wouldn't like say if i'm involved in that and i'm still doing this like i wouldn't bring it up in our meeting notes it would be something that that entity brings to the city an ad they bring to the city because they're different or like you know we obviously would have to coordinate our calendars as far as like if they're having events we're having events to coordinate and make sure that we're not but it's no different than like finding out if someone's got a wedding or yeah so then if yeah if they were once that our organization existed yeah they'd be above your heads at that point they would be dealing with this you wouldn't be like the liaison or anything like that maybe go directly into the city right for support and whatnot um because you know like it like your holes are they you know the city or you know they had events in the parks so they worked for the city on that and then um things were taken care of by the city trash or different support items gotcha and i think that's like a while ago when we talked about it um like they have to be their own entity and we can be in involved but they're not the same right and the um they charge to be members they have a hundred dollar as an individual member and two hundred dollars as a family and i'm assuming like if you know you know like how we have a little bellar beach sticker for your car for the parking you know you might get you know a little sticker saint beller beach community foundation to show that you're a member kind of gig or something like that and then um it says your membership includes free admission to all events and refreshments so if you look at their pictures they're holding a beer but that doesn't necessarily mean that so i made some phone calls like that might be if they did the dog and donut and you go like you get a donut but like if you if they do something that they have alcohol at you get one beer and then your wrist banded and then they sell the rest or something like that like it's not unlimited everything if they do alcohol because then there's no way they could sure yeah yeah and then they have sponsorships just like um this but they are tax deductible where these are not tax deductible if someone donates to the park and rec board to sponsor one of our events it's purely for their advertising and their exposure to the people that are there if they donate through the community foundation then it's a tax write-off which is the biggest difference so anyway all right so does anybody have anything else that they want to talk about or cover i didn't put old business or unfinished business so if we're good um our next meeting will obviously be the 29th which i should have wrote that on there um april 29th for setup but our next real meeting um will be um i don't know why the second order well i have may 2nd at 5 pm but like uh may 11th at 2 o'clock why did you have fun i don't know we were just strolling out later i thought that we could be ready to go i thought we could do it before the council meeting if you guys were all going that's exactly what it was but no i don't you guys don't have to go if you don't want to like sometimes you guys all come when i do presentations and sometimes you just can't so like i think that's why i had a question mark at the end so it could either be may 2nd at 5 before the meeting because we won't have a ton of things i mean after the 30th event we don't have anything until you know do you want to see up at 6 pm meeting you you can be i i mean i i like the support i like that when we're all here but i i hate telling you because i know it's right over the dinner you'll be here either way yeah it started coming to everything so i will be here yeah whatever you want to do george what do you think george five o'clock and stay for the city council meeting or part of it or uh or two o'clock in the 11th either way it doesn't matter i just thought if you're all going to be here that night then why come back again two weeks later and we're going to chat about anything we want to throw about last night yeah such as this and we can all go up if they ask a bunch of questions we can you can or i can by myself and that's why um so may 2nd at 5 o'clock sure all right so then that's that will be our next meeting and then i move to adjourn the meeting so we are adjourned"
