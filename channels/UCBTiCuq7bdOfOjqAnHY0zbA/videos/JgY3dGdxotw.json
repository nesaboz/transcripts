mandatory in Bel Air beach in order to get a variance we will actually vote on six different items the same as which was on your application after that we will have a motion and a second to approve and we'll have a role called the to decide whether or not the variance is approved or whether the variance is denied so at this point I'd like to read the application read the actual variance request is actually number 22-02 the address of 424 22nd Street Mr Mrs Dolan are asking a for a variance from section 94-220 the setbacks are listed on this actual variance request but is to allow for a maximum encroachment of eight inches into the 10 foot side setback on the west portion of the property so I will ask you or Randy would I would like to speak first to go ahead and make a staff report at this time Kyle reefler city manager City governor so I put a packet in front of you um that's going to be the same as the slides I'm going to go through and I'm going to cover what happened the timeline and the events how the city knows them to be um the original permanent application was approved for the property of four to four 22nd Street which is legally known as the whole View Estates Island first edition lot 26. that was approved by Al carrier via a Health carries a city engineer would be a letter that was given to our previous city manager Lynn Reeves and that's a letter so on August 23rd he said that this uh revised plan at the time was approved so from there on August 22nd or 27th 2021 lindberries approved the permanent application um and if you're not familiar with the permit process in the city it comes to us first for a pre-premit approval city engineer checks the site plans for our code it gets approved that he's taken to the Pinellas County Building Services which they do mainly the Florida building code in inspections so on the 27th and then approvement he said peral care be and this is the application and on October 25th 2021 the permit was created and issued by the Pinellas County it was cbp-21-04939 and until then they commence construction and uh built the structure uh containing through a permitting and inspection process with the county and then on November 15 2022 is when the Pinellas County Inspector noticed that the building setback was supposed to be at 10 feet and noticed that it was encroaching at a 10-foot setback and at that time a be notified the Builder and put the permit on hold so Al carrier the PE contacted me and said you know it's on hold because of an encroachment in the setback I took a look at the at the property looked at the um you know the legal description went to our setback on the section of the code and determined that they were correct that the um that the sunlight was supposed to be 10 feet as opposed to 7.5 so at that time I showed up illustration like a snapshot of the plans we showed what an encroachment is and then coach base point seven feet or about eight inches from what I understand there's another Association was done put it on hold um the Bell there requested that it wasn't find out through Al if we had a a way to like an admin override I contacted the City attorney we looked at the code closely and I saw that there was no admin decision that could I could override that um and um at that point we did we saw that the board of adjustments had to make the decision on the matter and uh I feel when looking at the uh this is the code it's actually 94-220 minimum living inside areas and setbacks when I looked at it I found Bellevue Estates Island on the first second and third edition and then it lists the science start back as 10 feet um I discussed this with Al um trying to understand why he approved the 7.5 L told me it made me aware of this on page three to five of that code where it said Bellevue Estates Island and this list 7.5 for example both sides that back um I looked at it closely um he also pointed out that he noticed in the section where there's his first second and third edition that Bellevue was built um b-e-l-l-e-v-i-e-w and in this section that he took the setbacks from it was spelled b-e-l-l-e-u-e and if you look at the legal description it shows it's spelled b-e-l-l-e-b-u-e so L felt disagreed with me um saying that he felt like that was the science that was when the science setback was supposed to be um I I believe it wasn't because there I did some more research um and and realized that there is no um Bellevue Estates Island uh that's spelled uh with the V iew so I saw that as a misspell because if you go higher up in the same section the regular belt of U.S states is also misspelled to so um being also that there's only a Bellevue States Island that's either first second or third edition I determined that that was what was referencing those properties that this Island shouldn't have been there so um how at that point wrote his letter um you know recommending that a variance is needed he pointed out that the uh that the spelling was different um you know consulted with the attorney to find out you know with the spelling that's different and that I that I believe there was a supposed to be a different setback in a marriage was needed he said yes so that's why we're here today um since then I went to the code and discovered that the last uh ordinance that that was codified was the young in April of 2008. so I uh city clerk found that ordinance for me which is this on ordinance number zero eight-02 you know when who found the setbacks in of the Bellevue estate side as it reads first second and third edition on page two and is up correctly so at some point when the code was codified it got misspelled so the original ordinance shows that it was supposed to be spelled that way but then I also noticed that LV was the island that section is very end is still there after all that um I hope you wrote his letter that's been good states that this huge variance for the setback being 10 feet in an encroachment and that also makes the note that it's spelled differently so that's all I have thank you very much any of you have any comments at this point no my role at this is not um as much as presenting the case but to make sure the process is abided by I would suggest at this point if any of the members of the body have any questions for the city manager now would be an appropriate time now and appropriate time to ask again thank you I'd like to ask the city clerk at this time at this time that we've received any correspondence regarding this variance request Penny no sir we did not no letters no emails no phone calls no no nothing okay thank you very much good question David were the plans submitted it managed them being a side step back at 10 feet and then Durham construction they approached by eight inches or the original plans what were they showing for the side set back on the West Side the original plans showed a 7.5 foot setback which were approved I have a good thing he had built on both sides of seven and a half feet we're only dealing with a three to eight inch crochet because at that when he could have got approval and started building at seven and a half on each side we'd be sitting here even worship yes all right thanks any other questions to the city manager Kyle thank you at this point but perhaps the applicant may have a question after they make their your statement thank you Mr Rogers if you Kerry come to the podium it's all yours play Gilman here on behalf of Brian Owens thanks for coming uh no we we agree with the timeline and uh everything the city manager um in that regard um as uh Mr Gardella noted uh it's it's just that eight eight inch uh it's like eight that tapers out about three or four inches um setback where you know we were approved for a seven and a half foot setback so it's a very minimal encroachment that where now is known that it's a 10 foot setback with all the I don't know if that's still the typos for the Bellevue and Bellevue um we there was some confusion and then once it was approved by Mr Harry or you know you know yeah again my client and the contract was all agreed that we were going to move forward with construction and it was only until Pinellas County came back several months later and corrected that error that we understood that it was foot setback so construction had already been underway and and things were moving so that's why we're here today for the variance for the uh I think it was like a three to eight inch setback encroachment um other than that of things it manages a good job explaining uh the whole situation and I don't have too much more to add other than um I don't know if there were pictures of the application um but there were pictures that show you know the I can hand you um that are showing that the setback approachment is is minimal and it only backs up into the neighboring properties air conditioning unit and utility area so it's not blocking any View and it's not a prohibitive of any of his properties rights we've got you got it okay great great thank you if you have any questions I'd be great otherwise I think that's all I have for you okay so the the applicant they had good faith in what they and what they did they went through the process the process okay them and yes yes they went through the process they you know submitted a point for seven after seven and a half and set back and we're at 9.3 trying to be you know as far away from that as possible and then you know they some of the plans in good faith that seven and a half was the setback because of the Bellevue Estates b-e-l-l-e-v-u-e and then the misspellings you know as I read the code um very difficult to tell which one they were referencing for the build U.S states Island are you changing communication with the neighbor on that side uh yeah we've actually discussed with the neighbor and I believe they have text messages correspondence that they are they are totally fine with with these and obviously they're not here so I don't think there's too much of an issue on their end that was my next question it has a good correspondence even verbally with the with the neighbor especially on that west side yeah okay with it right yeah more to speak to that I mean she is more aware of the actual communication programs I'm sorry man before you begin I don't believe you were sworn can you stand and raise your right hand yes declaration that the testimony you're about to give you since it's true let's see your name and address before you begin I'm Mariah Carey and I'm like one three four one six foot tears um owners to the west of the dublins but I just spoken with the Dolan in there where they've actually fixed their  you all you can see in the picture so they're friends so you're representing the you are the contractor yes so the contractor has been in contact with the dolans and the neighbors have been informed so everything's copacetic at this point yes okay I'll I'll add that I sold the house years ago to the peoples of the West Christian uh sign is his name yes and I called him earlier this week just to say are you aware of what's going on we have a urine I never heard back from him I left him a pretty detailed message so I think or anything back I'm sure it would be he would have contacted me if there was I think he travels a lot too yeah but um yeah it was a text message on Sunday that Vinnie had spoken really Christian and he was okay with me okay for the board to say we will go through our criteria of six questions I will ask each question um feed each question so that the applicant understands the procedure you're welcome sir stay right where you are if you care to as you won't I mean if there's any questions we can still

Goldman Mr Kelly yes motion passes 7-0 buy your vote the variance has been approved and nor will we enter accordingly thank you for your attention to this matter thank you okay thank you the last time there was a cover vision she and I both served on the board we had to resign our Board of adjustment and we had to be reappointed to the board of adjustment there's a Randy adventure's extension or an ordinance that says a member of the board of adjustment cannot serve under any other committee at the same time so in in the choice of that I just warned these all of you members that it may not be as well advisable otherwise you do have to resign the positions all we found out at the point of reappointment Carol and I had already served with council members and we were suddenly told you have to come back on and reapply so it got pretty pretty messy thank you very much is there any other writers before the board yes ma'am [Music] restriction I was curious who made that role and why was it um the city council made that rule and it was amended in 2016 to the current state that says the maximum height above the crown of the road that pool can be is 18 inches and one of the gentlemen on this board who hasn't pulled into construction now I had to come before this board with a variance for that purpose this is whether city engineer gets involved too because we have a similar issue at the Dolan residence where we're actually going to have to take dirt out to meet that experience it costs money to you know relocate the dirt and they have to put a step in in their hesitant to bring it up as another variance because it should be currently has with the recruitment and I just feel for them because you know they have to put a step in because of the school that doesn't make sense to me either but um they're trying to accomplish as it stands now um and they the applicant that we had for the meeting back in August um was told by the city at that point that either the rule gets changed so we chose because of time to go for Americans um again even if it goes through approval or review here at the city level Randy number take three or four months on it at least perhaps depending on how frequently the bodies meet and um it could be sooner than that but yes in both ordinances every ordinance or code Amendment takes the first reading and a second two hearings of the commission and that's provided it's not an amendment to the land coach it also has to go before Planning and Zoning or some other body some ordinances have to go through scientists but in as much as I'm being asked yes anytime there's an organs on the votes whether we believe it's sensible or God either the ordinance applies or you get a deviation from it and as that ordinance reads that's how it how it will work at this point this is all in in all honesty with you and Candor on record the wisdom behind any ordinance doesn't change its enforce ability right right okay well thank you for your time I'll bring it up with the Dome I I will tell you that in the past the recommendation um to those under new construction as you are um it's sometimes easier to comply the audience and go ahead and cut it to the 18 inches where it's an existing home that existing owner that had nothing to do with with how the ordinance was written a variance is booked upon more gracefully so essentially new construction and you're aware and you can make that choice in terms of time and then getting finished it might be better for them for the sake of compliance ultimately that's a decision your client has to make on its own in the city can that give you legal advice thank you thank you very much I appreciate everybody coming today thank you very much for standing"
