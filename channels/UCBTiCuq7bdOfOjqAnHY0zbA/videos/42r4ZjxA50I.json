appreciate it and we'll take 10 minutes and then we'll come right back and uh wrap it up all right so uh let's move right on into item number one a discussion of uh proposed ordinance regarding comprehensive sign regulation and um we're going to uh give the floor right over to uh Randy Morris stand in sir you had the floor uh thank you mayor council members Robert essenfelder um my understanding from Mr Moore is that they'll already had a workshop and gone through it so what is your pleasure and should you want to go Page by page again or do you all just want to individually let me know uh veterans or comments you have and I got one question we had a handout that's on the table then we had the one that was previously in our packet which is the the up-to-date one one that was on the table is is the most up-to-date uh do you can you uh give us a rundown of anything that may have changed uh between what's in our agenda packet and what we have on the table yes um everything that Mr Moore changed between uh this time and last time is in red strikethrough online and so if you look on the one that's on the table so that we're all on the same page numbers it would be page number 20. and he made changes to the definition of portable sign what is note uh indicated to me he did that have feedback from you all so I don't if you take a chance to read it let me know if it reflected what you want so that's the center definitions right yeah yeah whenever I read through the copy that's in our agenda packet it looked to me uh like he put in all of all of our requests did anyone see any discrepancies at all okay and the only thing that's changed is this uh is what's in red and that was where he was just cleaning up some uh some language does anyone have any questions about what we're uh what's being presented to us tonight yeah uh General consensus from the Council on this item as everyone satisfied with this we're fully aware of that Mr Banker I'm satisfied I appreciate your opinion all right and uh it's Livingstone yes sir you okay yes sir okay vice mayor Shirley it's fine okay Boyd Roberts I'm good with it all right Leslie I had a couple um issues which I was talking to the City attorney like the definition of color means any distinct tint you or shade including black white and or gray so what is not color hair I'm not real sure you know what I mean so so it's not a hill that I want to die on so if y'all want me to strike it I will that the purpose of it though it is to lawyers are interesting creatures and they will make arguments wherever they can to try to challenge and so if you use the word color to talk about signage and you don't say that it includes black white and gray then the lawyer is going to say well why not my sign doesn't apply because my client sign doesn't apply because it's black and white on where you know something like that and so that's why we're just saying if you can see it you know being translated by your eyes it's a color it's okay even though most of us don't understand that black and white is so that's why it's there okay any other questions Miss Notaro no attorney you know sorry um no everything else was um helped give me a couple uh and I think you said this came out of the um out of the statute but it's on page it's 39 in the book those section 86 19. so um so section B uses that removal of political campaign advertisements it's on it's on page 39 of the one that's on the table and um you know the councilwoman made a a good point that it's not uh the wording of it isn't the grammar that she would use however this uh I don't know if Mr Moore told you before but this comes right out of the Florida statute and so we want to not deviate from the words of the Florida statute because if we ever get challenged for this in in terms of a a First Amendment or whatever we're just going to Simply say this is exactly what the legislature did so if we follow the legislature you know the whole state Falls so we don't care about the grammar again I'm here to take your will but if the legislature used that grammar I'm just thinking it's best to use the same okay those were the comments I had that's it and um going back to the the flags I know that you uh you raised the 30-foot flagpole supports a 40-foot flag um but do we want two flags that size on a pole that size yeah I I wouldn't either I I that's the stress load I mean that one of those pictures those flags takes an awful lot of stress and I don't I've put multiple flags on it the flight 70 reduced about that long and that's only in case of a party well the only reason why I bring it up is because I I drove past your house and wanted to see that flag and you don't have that size flag I don't think you have a three by five yeah the small cheap one right now okay can I asked what section we're talking about this is uh page 40 uh flags at the bottom thank you thank you oh thanks so my recommendation would be uh maybe one of those in a three by five maximum instead of two uh 40 square feet Flags oh I'm definitely fine with that yeah that makes sense to everyone so um you want it to say one flag well what it is is on for instance my flag pole at home mine's a small one and I have a three by five and then I have a whatever the next size is down for for the State of Florida so the United States flag is the largest and then um and I was just thinking two 40 square foot Flags anywhere in Bel Air Beach is probably crazy uh so um do we want to reduce maybe say one flag at that size and then something smaller uh the next maybe a three by five is the second maximum foreign why did we increase it from a 15 to 40 in the first place well um it wasn't was it 15 was it 15 is lined out yeah originally it was and um there's there's standard flag sizes for standard hole sizes and um uh Mr Sable raised the uh the issue that he has a 30-foot flagpole and the standard uh size for that size pole is actually a five by eight okay fine that's good right but definitely no two fly by Eights on a pole what my hopes are is that that there's a three by five but I understand it you know that's a regulation flag pole size and if we allow 30-foot flagpoles then we have to allow one uh five by eight okay why don't we just say one five by eight or two three by or you know because right now it says two flag's not greater than 15 square feet well see I don't have mine wasn't I'm looking at this I'm comparing the two right so if we allowed to just limit well this is still like the 40 square feet yeah it's it's um it's what the council wants so I I just wanted to bring it up that wow I mean the thing would almost be touching the ground I know I'm looking at the big one over there kind of thinking how big is that is that on the other side of the bridge uh that one's I think that one's you can see here 12 or something yeah those are those are car lots flag experts so yeah I'm just saying I mean my retirement flies most flags are yeah the three by fives but the standard you know my recommendation would be the um maximum um in fact you could even take it to you could even take it to uh a five by eight for 30 foot and 25 or less three by five you know you can do all sorts of things to uh to really make it concise but uh I do know that I had a neighbor he doesn't live there anymore but he put a giant flagpole out in the front yard and that flag makes some noise it was very very loud and uh he wouldn't put a second flag on there but I was just thinking boy if he put two of those up there what a I mean it's possibly a hazard so what do you think uh three by five is the second and then and then we're done with it yeah so the first flag five by eight yeah the second flag if so chosen three by five or smaller yeah and no grade isn't things like that right that makes sense that work for everyone and that was really the only thing that I had what's the next step I mean I'm assuming yeah everything looked good to me you know with the corrections is um we propose this going forward into the next city council meeting I don't think it's been to your planning thing board yeah so so it has to the playing board because it's part of your Land Development code uh per statute and then once the planning board reviews it and provides you whatever comments and suggestions that it has then it comes back to you all for the first screen that the citizens can get and you all can get all right I just want to return to Flags to make sure I got so you want to say the first shall be no greater than five by eight correct and the second shall be no greater than three by five correct right got it thank you that's all I had uh Council anyone else no no sir okay well let's move right on to uh item number two discussion of the 2023 comprehensive plan draft um consider proper zoning land use for the hotel condominium parcels and this was placed on the agenda by vice mayor Shirley you have the floor yeah so um I uh recently had to find hotel rooms for family and found that the rooms along the beach are rented nightly um although we say we have no hotels on the beach they call themselves hotels they rent like hotels they act like hotels but we have no commercial property on the beach according to our comp plan the reason for bringing this up is we all know that the cities will need funds for future projects and just moving forward the last thing I want to do is tax our residents but if we have commercial businesses already operating on the beach and maybe we should look at how that tax base might be affected if we did allow a future land use of hotels because they're already operating as such and if we got back to bed tax for those nightly rentals there's something kind of opening up for discussion everyone to look at and think about I think it's um I think it could potentially be a good Revenue source that we are overlooking now I may you know Council might have a different opinion but it would not be nice to hear when it you know the legal side of that might look like and is it a possibility to you know can we all get on board of taking a look at it and seeing if there's an opportunity to raise revenues a little bit without taxing our residents yes Mr Roberts I'm just looking for some clarification because I was told I think more than once when I asked about that particular building you know what is it because when I first came up to register with the city and then I set up on 20th Street pretty much across the street from the from the hotel and they said no we don't have a hotel it says Hotel you know so it looks like Hotel so my question is I was later told that each of the units are owned personally similar to like a condo and then it's managed from within so perhaps they do rent them out on a nightly basis I don't know um what what is that first statement is that accurate that each of the units like Mr Smith and Mrs Smith own 101. it's not owned by one hotel owner is that true so I can tell you the Bellaire Beach Resort has multiple owners there's one owner that owns more than 50 percent of the of the units those of them are one bedroom one bath you can walk in there and rent them by the night okay even the ones that are owned individually are still you're able to rent by the way um which runs a foul of our right and somebody somebody at the desk manages that with respect to who's up next that's right it's not the thing it's pretty common anymore okay yeah and then the one that's further north the little blue Hotel I don't I that is strictly timeshare you can only get it by the week but it's still time sharing you can rent it by the week so again I don't know if there's opportunity for bed tax or you know some way to offset because it is tax it is a lot of work for our staff the if you walk the beach it's busy especially on holidays and it's there's a lot of extra traffic on the beach a lot of extra trash on the beach a lot of if you go to the um our our only beach access with a bathroom and you walk in there it's disgusting and our staff has to clean it you know it's and that's from you know all this use of Outsiders used in our our beach and I think that we just need to be creative about how to how to tax that if there's an opportunity to tax it more we should is is there a resort tax fee that's charged to these hotels so named uh uh Resort tax entertainment tax I mean if you if you want right now out to rent in the Hampton Inn or whatever and you were on the beach or something like that you mostly in Clearwater you get a resort tax you get an entertainment tax that uh um do we get any sort of any of that money you currently don't um and that has to do with the way it's zoned the uh Ford Pinellas threw out some options which they called a uh Resort facilities overlay um which was purpose its purpose is of this category is to depict utilization and overlay over residential areas that are now that are now developed um receivers so the use of characteristics so it's it's primary use of residential temporary lodging but it's a different zoning requirement um which enables you to charge fees from what we are at the residential medium which we can short we can uh maybe are you saying in layman's terms that we can dip or beak into that money and it's possible I don't know all the legalities of it um you might well so two things going on here forward Pinellas advises you on land use and so what they're proposing as as an alternative is a way to allow it and call it something in your plan because right now from what I'm hearing you don't what is it currently zoned resident residential Museum oh yeah um so and if it has a front desk you know and it's operating like a hotel you know I think the first thing is if you don't want that to be occurring then you need to go in with code enforcement and say I don't know what this is but it's clearly not residential you know and so you need to shut down the front desk because you're clearly operating commercial that'll freak everybody out but if you don't mind then you know that's up to you all as policy and it's it's more okay it's here it's operating let's regulate it the way the reality is and let's start getting revenue flowing in because the reality is that that the town is paying for uh like you said the restrooms and so forth then you would change the zoning and an overlay is is an option to do it I represent running from Shores and they did a tourist facilities overlay they called it same kind of a thing over a residential neighborhood because there's so many vacation rentals there and um but in terms of the tax revenue you need to turn to what does the legislature allow to tax because as a municipality we can't tax anything that the legislature hasn't expressly allowed us to so the hotel industry and all of its little subdivisions time shares and so forth are regulated under chapter 509 of Florida Statutes and and um it provides definitions for each of the things what is a hotel there's a definition for it what is a motel what is a time share and then there are taxes that are required of all that and then of course Pinellas County is overlaid it's bed tax and so forth that would then begin to apply so if you wanted to go in that direction we could go in that direction as well so really you guys just needed to Talk Amongst yourselves uh either tonight or at some point you know where do we want to go with it and then give us direction of where to go and work with the manager to bring back to you what needs to change so uh Mr uh ashenfelder um I'm not pronouncing that right by the way you are indeed better than my half my law professors right right okay so um at the end of the day if you just want to get right down to it these are short-term rentals all right and we are grandfathered in right now and we don't allow short-term rentals however if we go and we change anything in our ordinances that would impact the outcome of short-term rentals we lose it all is my understanding that is a very strong art there's no case that's held that yet and the reason why is because local governments who are in the beautiful position you're in of being grandfathered in don't want to risk that grandfathering and so they don't want to even change a DOT on the eye because then lawyers will come rolling in and say oh it's all gone now there is a bill that's been filed this year that gives that little bit of a nugget to say that if you change your grandfathered code but it is to be more generous you don't lose your grandfathered code the unfortunate part about that bill which is by a senator that we all know um also has a lot of negative things for local governments correct so I know a lot of my communities are opposing that bill but but I think in terms of of um what you're going to get the argument on with the lawyers because that bill was even filed even if it doesn't succeed the lawyers are going to say see here in this legislative session the legislature was thinking about allowing local governments to change their code but they didn't pass it so you can't so the clearly the legislature was thinking your honor you can't do it so so my advice and I think Mr Morris as well is you're risking a lot if you change anything about short-term and I uh we're talking about 714 SB 714 correct correct um it looks to me like that's a trap it looks to me like they're they're the language is so vague and weird and the way that they're I mean they say the same thing three or four times differently and not only that but they but it's so rich I wrote the legislative update and and and I find it interesting that it purports to to give us brand new power to set up a registration system when we already have them we already have that power so it is a trap in that way too because I can see that the lawyers are going to come and say oh well the legislature is now parceling out little bits of power to you so that means you can't do anything else with respect to Vacation Rentals it's a real terrible right it's uh they wrote it in a way that looks like we can make a little money off of this by forcing them to register correct and uh and even that is a restriction uh so um as much as I can't stand where we're at right now with this this whole uh debate is uh my recommendation would be to let's wait and see what happens with this bill and then talk about it after whether it passes or it fails but they're going to keep coming they're just going to keep coming after us more and more until they they get their way it's the same bill that's been proposed last year yes what what buff would last at least seven years I think they've thrown something out and it's got watered down stiffened up and it's from the real estate Lobby it's really pushing this thing and hopefully it doesn't get tracked one of our lawmakers brother runs a bunch of vacation rentals up and down I suspected that here one more question um because I started dabbling into these uh hotel rentals and they are hotel rentals but they're not owned by the hotel anymore some towns say if you live you're allowed the owners allowed to live or use that occupancy for up to 30 days a quarter if they exceed that then they have to pay school tax to our owners and these like what you explained to they'd have to pay the school tax on each one of these units or Pinellas County tax taxable on those units or so the the yeah that the county sets that and it goes by what the zoning is on it so if it's residential it's Zone one way if it's commercial it doesn't matter if the owner's in there 30 days or how it's used is irrelevant okay to school tax so the and I would go to the time shares as well they're just they just get an annual whatever the zone is whatever the value property is that's what's gonna we pay the same taxes thank you and so and currently we charge a registration fee for 300 rentals but not to condo rentals is that correct that's all all condo and household rentals so all the condos are paying and it's so even if it's so if each condo pays 300 a year three years no matter how many times it's rented correct and the uh the bill is going to reduce that to 50. yeah or if let's say you have 20 your maximum uh bill would be 100 wow so would it make sense and just and if it's the answer is no that's fine but on the comprehensive plan if we do an overlay and then F down the road because once you've got this land use code you know we can't plan done with your Landing so that's it that's your you're kind of married to it for the next 10 years right you can change it there's an opportunity for out of cycle changes but but what happens is if you if you do that that's going to impute greater investment value to the land in the overlay District because now more can be done with it and then if you take it away in the future now you're opening yourself to a Bert Harris claim gotcha so be very careful about giving something because that's the issue you can you change it yes you can but then they're going to come after you and say oh well now you took away my potential for commercial use now I'm back to just residential I've lost my investment back to expectations pay me money so do you see any opportunity for any further taxation on these vacation rentals that are out there are they are they are they coming in these units and registering or are they just ignoring us the ones that yeah when they're notified and being honest about it they do come in um there's definitely got to be some that we're not we're not getting um and then the hotel the owner um it was a dispute last year where he finally did pay his rental registration fee for his units but he still hasn't paid this year so he's stories for each of his units that he owned yes he paid 300 that property just changed hands I mean you couldn't have changed hands without I wouldn't think without that assessment being paid did they call for a title on it all of those units how recently the Bellar Beach Resort I haven't seen uh yeah when you say assessment are you speaking of the registration fees that they're that you'll require you can buy and sell that's not going to Cloud title okay so that the title search wouldn't even um but you should call the city though for a clear they do yeah yeah right but but what our answer there is supposed to be are there any open code liens that have been filed you know that's really because that Cloud's title A filed lien means that somebody can come and take money off this property the fact that they owe a registration fee if we haven't cited them for it yet and then gone on and you know it's just probably not completely yeah what we should do if we are aware of units is Code Enforcement say you know this you're required to pay this 300 fee here's your code citation pay it yes sir Mr Roberts so so right now I just want to clarify the short-term rental in my own head so short-term rental for residences is what 30 days 90 days 90 days 90 days for homes and for condos does it vary by condo based on the condo association it's pretty much the association deals with it okay so they determine how much their people can rent it out for what period of time okay the city has no regulation about that you can't change your regulation to one overnight though right you could change the condo association can actually change it to daily rentals right yeah if they could if the other owners agree to it fine all right yeah see that's that's where we may have the resort we have an owner says if we work with the resorts to try to do something where then it's the homeowners association or you know condo Owners Association who's actually imposing more restrict regulations and not the city would you agree yeah and I I I'm so curious about this entity like you know is there a common parking area and yes how do they deal with that like if somebody owns more than 50 but then you got to vote there's got to be some condo dock I would imagine that has been created because otherwise if I'm if I only own one of those units how what are my rights to the Common Parking if a sinkhole happens in the Common Parking Lot who you know am I obligated to pay that are you obligated to pay that there's got to be more behind the curtain that we don't know and ultimately ultimately it's there's potential to have worse neighbors than what what the single family dwellings have because now I mean you know how noisy someone can be if they're you're sharing a wall cheaper uh so they're probably we probably just need to um Leslie you would you you could probably do an informal survey with your neighbors and just ask them how they feel about it because ultimately you know you're in a smaller you're in a smaller condo right right but I'm sure that uh that rules do change from time to time and and it's because uh people like you bring something to uh the the association's attention we had an issue a while ago but we changed it with with our association um more strictly yeah we do hit the city does have a list of the contact for every yeah perhaps we could use that list to inquire as to what their rental restrictions are I mean I'm happy to call a bunch of them I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to um to to gather that data have another meeting in a work session just to review the data and decide whether it's something that we could maybe have a special meeting invite invite them in and say hey we're aware that you have a problem and we'd like to help you by it's not helping you get organized and uh I mean ultimately there's no Revenue uh there's it wouldn't help us with any Revenue but it would certainly be the right thing to do if uh if there's problems in those areas so we're looking for a definition of the resort um Jody what do you think it would be right now based on what your hometown it's a hotel and we don't allow voters and I think the other two are legitimately timeshare but you know so we have condos and we have time shares we have condos we have time shares and we have in one hotel yeah yeah and I you know and the the two timeshares look like hotels everyone refers to them as a hotel No Vacancy yeah they have No Vacancy signs up you know but um and I think most of the condos are like where Leslie lives the residents are gonna step up and say this is what we want and they're not going to allow this but you know we've got some situations where we have hotels for those other buildings the resort do they have an association do we know I'm sure they do and they have docs I was gonna actually go to public record and pull them and I just didn't with what you know I'd been going through I haven't had a chance to pull those but you know I was going to pull the docs and see what they say but you know if you've got an owner that owns more than 50 likely he can change those docs to whatever he wants them to say yeah without any other vote but but also bear in mind if he owns 50 of the of whatever units or however many units are in in the uh the building or the uh the complex it's probably making a lot of money and probably it's not going to want to give that up it would have to be individuals those would be the ones you'd have to have a greater percentage that would be against it than a single owner who had a whole handful of them but uh that's definitely something to look into and uh talk and talk further about okay um the last question I have is uh aside from a revenue perspective is this really a problem for the city is it a problem I mean I think it creates some problems whenever we have you know when you get the police report typically it's non-residents so that tells you something right um so does it create problems certainly does but you know but and I'm always looking at how can we how can we increase revenues without taxing our residents right well I think the other thing to think about too is you know you all have every city and county has Zoning for a reason because you're trying to say this fits with this and you know that and so to some extent knowingly allowing essentially a commercial hotel to be operating in what we've proclaimed to be residential it isn't really doing what what the people want you to do you know it's like you're you're saying well we know that this is residential but we're letting Win Dixie operate right in the middle of it or something you know philosophically speaking we shouldn't turn a blind eye if someone is truly flaunting the zoning that they're in because it can create an argument down the road and I'm being somewhat hypothetical here but you know someone else is going to come say when you start picking on them and enforcing well what about that hotel over there that is in the middle of a residential and you haven't done anything to them for years now you're picking on me because I have a home-based business or whatever so that's just something to keep in mind too it's you should ultimately I'm gonna say it's urgent but you should talk continue to talk it through and decide which route do you want to go do you want to go back to residential the way it is and if so get code enforcement out there and say you gotta shut down that Lobby that lobbies have no place in residential or if you want to face reality and maybe get revenue and all that you go down the road of overly yeah so so maybe what we should first do is fully uh analyze uh what kind of zoning they are in and what are their rules specifically and what are they in violation of because that's Revenue also and I would also just encourage everyone to read this comp plan because the other one was riddled with errors and things that didn't really apply and there's some you know uh this this is like the beginning of our strategic planning right this should have some of those when we got our Capital Improvement projects listed in here they should be accurate they should be it should be a hit list of what we intend to get done and um the one in the past saying um the flood budget was not nearly what it really was so there's just some things that we really need to pay attention to it's not just a checkbook box it's done sort of thing everyone needs to read it thank you okay any other discussion on the uh on item number two uh the comprehensive plan draft yeah no all right we're on to item number three and this is actually a continuation of a topic that Mike Sable uh brought up but I am uh passing the torch over to the city manager uh this is a discussion of revising the marina waitlist policy yeah so the last time we talked we uh uh yes sir if you'd like to just come up and speak for a second I I don't have a problem with that well while you're on the subject of the comprehensive plans um I'm a member of the board that's reviewing the comprehensive plan and the one topic tonight is fine but I wanted to kind of plant a seed the council doesn't mind going forward when you're reviewing this comprehensive plan may I yes um I just want to point out some things for Pinellas this is the organization that is helping us review our comprehensive plan to make sure we're meeting the state county mandates regarding our comprehensive plan and comply being in compliance with that of the county and State they're also doing that for every city in Pinellas County the same organization they are also the ones who are advising Pinellas County or their plans having said that I'd like to skip to one point and that's transportation when you go through this there's a transportation element when you read it it's discussing what Bellaire Beach needs to do to be responsible in its transportation system apply Clearwater Beach when you read Bellaire Beach I think Clearwater Beach and have they complied and have they met the standards for instance um just one of the points here development projects that generate between 50 and 300 new peak hour trips of Defense on deficient roads shall be classified as tier one and required to submit a transportation management plan designed to address their impacts while increasing mobility and reducing the demand for single occupant vehicle traffic I was on the citizens Review Committee that reviewed the construction of this bridge and all during those meetings we were constantly told the reason it's two lane and Gulf Boulevard will be two lane is that the state says they don't want greater density on the Bayer of islands because of the obvious concerns for um storms and the cost um if the area is impacted by a storm so the bridges remain too late and Clearwater had four lanes because they had four lanes coming in this is back when all of the motels on Clearwater Beach were little Mom Pop motels as soon as all of this was constructed Clearwater Beach exploded and they're continuing every day to build high density High occupancy facilities but yet not one extra road going in or out of Clearwater Beach it's still all cars there's no high density Transportation rail or any other things being done to reduce vehicular traffic which all of you know is what is greatly impacting us so as you read this and understand what we're being required to do think about how they have missed the boat on doing those things themselves and where was the oversight and why aren't we asking for a review of the oversight process for Clearwater Beach because I think that's about the only thing you can do um to try and mitigate what's happening there probably won't happen in my lifetime but there needs to be another bridge out of there and there needs to be high density traffic and how are we going to get that by asking why they didn't comply with the very things that they're supposed to and why are these people who are guiding us not guiding them properly to implement the things they're supposed to be implementing thank you Mr Davis Council I will let you know that I actually did speak to Ford Pinellas about two months ago and I appeared at one of their meetings they I was invited by Cookie Kennedy uh the mayor of Indian Rocks Beach to come speak because it was her last meeting as chair of forward Pinellas so I uh uh it was uh uh myself and two other Mayors uh in The Big C we were invited to come speak and uh we were asked if there was anything that we would like to see and I explained to all of Ford Pinellas that um we were completely overrun with traffic and it's not just a holiday it's not it's just spring break it's you never know when it's going to happen but it happens all the time and I explained that it takes 10 to 15 minutes to get out of our streets sometimes because the cars are so backed up and nobody will give you a break to get out and uh and I painted a real ugly picture of what was going on here and I I also said the reason why this is happening is because they're all heading to Clearwater Beach the most popular beach in the world and uh and I said so I appreciate you uh inviting me to speak and what I would like to ask for is a new bridge from Sam key back over to Gulf to Bay so that they can come in loop around and go right back out they did not like that at all they thought that that was the dumbest thing they had ever heard and then they uh they said that that's um we have to put up with it because that's what we get from tourism and I I came home I was Furious and and I looked it up I I called Kyle I said how much how much are we getting you know for pennies for Pinellas from tourism and he gave me the number and it came out to 600 a day so for six hundred dollars a day this is what we get they they believe that they can solve all of our problems with rapid rail that will never make it here they believed in people coming here will get off that rapid rail hop on a bus that won't get them to their final destination and I explain that to all of them that you know you're going to have some people that will do this but most people want to just drive in and go right to their hotel and park their car and they're not going to do this so whenever I explain this to all the other Mayors up and down the beach they they told me exactly what you're talking about all they care about is Clearwater Beach and Saint Pete and and everybody else has just fodder in the middle and uh and we just need to comply and conform well I'm I'm not doing that I am uh I'm still going to be a thorn in their side and I'm going to keep going back and I'm going to see if nothing else I can get some people thinking um there is a a little bit of a bright side is that um commissioner Scott is now on that on that board and he um he knows all about buses he knows all about rapid rail he knows about all that because he owns the Ascot bus uh line and you know the private private tour buses and uh and he was very uh not very favorable in their eyes a while back he had actually gotten on a board and they haven't had him removed because they didn't like what he had to say and that prompted him to run for office and and now he's on the the County Commission but uh uh that there may be a chance to that we can get more people to listen or reply I see him very extensive photos of uh Gulf Boulevard uh wherever wherever we are Gulf Boulevard Causeway Boulevard I got in a boat took pictures of the bridge completely back up I showed him everything and he said oh my God I had no idea it was like that and so if we can get more of those pictures to Ford Pinellas maybe they'll they'll quit picking on us and and start looking at the real problem because uh it's it's just not fair what's happening to us and I know we've complained about this over and over and over but the the type of complaints that are our complaining system for the past three years was not that great and I think that we can do a much better job by um uh approaching them a little more delicately than than uh than trying to Ram it down their throats yes or Mr zabel um yeah in fact I went out with an email it was last week and it got a lot of responses we were talking about you know what to do with the north-south rerouting of ways that takes you off golf and Route you around through our communities and um first of all no speed bumps people don't want those but they're extremely upset at the traffic that it's not only there but gets rerouted through the community so you can't I'll send the emails over to Kyle and Kyle can send them on to you um those that have suggestions and just complaints about the traffic situation I think we're going to be discussing that that uh that particular problem uh in item six so we'll we'll uh we'll bring that right back up anything else anyone would like to add about the comprehensive plan no thank you for going up and I wasn't discounting what you presented us but uh I think uh what Mr Davis is telling us is be beware yeah because there's a certain direction they're trying to steer everyone towards and they there's a master plan and we're just in the way I'm no fan of forward Pinellas when they came out and wanted us to write you know they wanted to make a bike line lane and who knows it will still happen bring that downtown Largo median and bike Lanes all the way through to you know to the beach basically and drop the speed limit to 25 and you know it will never get home if we don't have four lanes out there if they're too late we'll just have a nightmare it's gonna be a mess it got shot down doesn't mean the plan's gone I'm just gonna forewarn everyone that you need to stay aware of what Ford Pinellas is doing yep I agree they want you to park your car and ride a bike and I guarantee you they're not no and they never will okay um so uh if that's it on this topic thank you Mr Davis um let's move on to item three again uh Mr riesler yeah the floor okay so the last time when we discussed um we sort of established that the priority for the marina was agreed upon my Council that it would be for uh residents um we probably own a residents the people who actually live in this area to utilize the the asset um since then I've looked at a lot of information um primarily uh Dunedin uh they discovered that they recently did a uh they paid an outside contractor to do a survey of all the local marinas in the area and they drafted up a report um and it's actually pretty useful information if you look at what their findings were what I did notice that um from our last resolution which was resolution 2020-19 uh when we the last time we looked at the marina and that we uh established what the rate increases would be and how the increments which we went up um the first year which was 2021 and then we um we're coming up on our next raise which is going to be April 1st 2023 and then the final rate increase um is April 1st 2025 and over that span of time it it raises the residents who are at a fee of seven dollars per foot up to ten dollars per foot and for the non-residents who were at ten dollars worth but it raises them up to the fifteen dollars per foot so that's just a recap but from this study that I looked at um we are um we're kind of on point for what all the other marinas are charging in this area um whether they're charging by foot or charging by slip size uh one of the issues that's been brought up is um with the wait list um it was currently prioritized by the length of the vessel um if if we're focusing on the residents in our community under some residents that have been on there quite a long time um who don't plan on buying bigger boats so if our vision is to um serve their business the best way possible it may be to consider rearranging the waitlist as far as the time they've been on there to be at the top so if you've been on there long I said you're next in line um and I did some analysis just of the uh the current lengths of boats and if say in 20 years we accomplished this goal because right now we're at um we're at a little over uh 50 of the slips are rented by Resident local residents um there's three non-resident and then the rest are non-resident Property Owners they own property but they're not actually residents so if you a Siri um over time if we reshape our waitlist policy and it slips open um we start moving more of the residents who are on there into the slips um it will decrease um can I laid out the numbers it will decrease the average length of the boats in the slips so in turn will ultimately decrease the revenue track that we're on um there are there are options to uh to reshape the amounts per slip I I did draft up um some different uh spreadsheet that just kind of laid it out and and showed uh you know how we could stay on track by by charging um each slipped differently if it was like uh by foot so if it was 11 to 11.99 it would be one price and then it would incrementally bump up depending on the size of that slip so the numbers are there if we decide to go that route to um bring in the same Revenue projections which would be this year we're looking to bring in um 62 000 from rental Revenue per year and by 2025 it was projected it was seventy thousand six hundred dollars so that is an option um we could do it the way we've been doing it which is shown to be on track but we also if we re-prioritize that wait list and how we're moving people into the marina we're going to decrease our Revenue so we may want to consider reshaping how we charge the slips um another thing is I looked at the rental agreement of Dunedin and uh just a lot of the different ideas that they have and uh there's a lot of things that um can be considered um besides this prioritizing there's um they've uh they have rules and Rags that can deal with problems that we see in the marina um one of them would be they have like a regulation that says only one family unit per can have one slip they can't have multiple slips um they have rules that say you know if the slip is vacant for such and such time it is forfeited our current rules are not that strict that's actually in our Marina code um they have deposits they have required deposits to get on the wait list it I think the residents will have no problem paying the deposit because they'll be serious and they'll stake in the game um in turn I think that will decrease our maintenance costs of the wait list because we have 50 plus non-residents that are just throwing their name on every list so that's something to consider um they have Legacy options someone who's been renting a slip uh for 10 years straight if another slip opens they get first dibs it moving to a slip before the next person on the list gets into that it's like so that's something to consider um and then ultimately you know we're in a we're in a market right now where the demand is is high for a slip and it could turn because there was 10 15 years ago it was different they had trouble filling the slips um so I would always um keep the non-resident option on the on the waitlist policy and then you know whatever price points we decided just have a multiplier for that if that it gets to a time when non-residents actually are running the slips so I don't know how the council feels about all this information I can draft I can take it and I can draft what I feel would be a positive direction to manage the marina and then present it to you and then have your opinion or if you want to get involved with kind of each topic I've talked about then I'm fine with that as well um I would not have a problem at all and assisting you with that if you're okay with that um we can work together and uh and then present it to the council if uh if you're good with that yeah I'm I'm up for the challenge you were talking about residents and Property Owners right we're dealing with them separately yeah those are separate categories so if you own a house here if you don't live there you go on the property owner as opposed to the restaurant if you're just renting it yeah it was like I mean I was looking at other things this I understand about the income and we'll probably address that through inputs to you but really whatever the slip costs that's what the slip costs uh the problem was that our resident owners were not moving down the list so the thought was if you're a resident owner the longest one on there you're given the option to get whatever slip is open if it's one of the larger ones you'll pay that but that's up to you you can decline it it goes down uh the reason you know our very cautious in terms resident owner these are the people's skin in the game they not only own but they vote there are constituents if you are a non-resident owner you have other opportunities you may have a slip at your condo down in you know Boca Raton um these people that live here the resident owners don't have that option really so this is the only source that's why we're very cautious about that in fact I don't go so far as even remove non-residents look it's strictly this is City use resident owners are on the list you pay deposit you're on and that's how they'll work through it we don't lose Revenue because it's your option look if you want the bigger one you know you're next on the list you can accept it even with your little rowboat there gives you that option hey I got to fill that up that's up to you but those are the thoughts but I guess you'll be bringing up all these considerations okay yeah looking forward here oh yeah yeah okay all right uh anything else any other comments on this topic can I can I just add a couple of things one is I agree with Mike with the um price per slip rather than price per foot um if the slip accommodates a 50-foot boat that's the price of the boat uh the slip um the other thing is we have the resident the non-resident owner that has two slips we need to kind of deal with that I think that there should be a capacity of once you know as long as we've got residents resident owners that want to slip we need to you know maybe limit that to one slip I I know as I understand it as being one family owned two properties but it makes it difficult when we have people waiting for you know you have the one family with two slips that's a difficult situation so I think we should kind of visit that when you're looking at it and then I don't even see a reason to maintain a non-resident waitlist if we've got that many I mean don't even maintain it I mean at some point if you need to open it back up fine but right now there's no need for you guys to go through the the hassle of dealing with adding them to lists and and coordinating and organizing all that information it's just I have an idea of how to address that and and I'll I'll discuss it with you it's way simpler than than what we're maintaining two separate lists yeah but uh but we'll get together and okay and uh we'll have something to do for the next work session sure uh does that work for you Mr briefler yes yeah okay Mr Roberts yeah just a comment I think um or recommendation I would approach this from like a blank piece of paper as if this Marina just fell into our city I think if you try to combine where we are today it just gets too confusing right the only problem with that is is he's fully populated now I get that and so then once you have it set up the way you would want it set up regardless of who's there now and who's not there now and then you that there it is this is how we want this contract to be in place and then deal with the specifics that exist today I mean we could even give time periods and say hey if you're a non-resident property owner and you have a slip we're going to give you six months and then you have to move it you know I'm sure there's I mean I would ask Council I mean I don't know what the contract says that these people currently signed if they even signed a contract but we could give them a reasonable time period to say hey you don't really fit into our nude our new setup the way we defined everything so you have X amount of time to find another place because she was for grandfathering Clauses or you're this you're acting in a proprietary capacity here so if you if you make a pivot and how you operate that facility I think it's it's appropriate to give a reasonable phase because it's hard to find it later let's get them out yeah yeah but yeah I mean if you change the way you do business then you can just break out there doing it so anyway just a thought no I think that's a great thought I mean this is voice mayor said that this this is really a resident benefit I mean how many slips do we have it's only like 15 years earlier around 18 18 and how many residents 1600 I mean and then you have one resident having two slips yeah not not resident property owner limited research yeah but it's just this is ridiculous I mean it should be resonated as an honors and three that are just non-resident not Property Owners either that are you know so those three should go definitely yeah we give them less I mean there was a discussion about renters full-time renters being able to yeah I I personally I don't have a problem with that because there are some people that probably rent and they've been here for years um so I I think there should be a a task that number one can I see your driver's license do you actually live here if you're if your license is out of state well you don't really live here um that's right yeah you're not you don't immediately you're you're sort of kind of uh put at a lower uh tier and then um you've got some true property owners that live here year round and their driver's license says they do uh and renters do the same thing and you've got property owners that not only are they making money off of us but they've got a cheap place to keep their boat and and uh and then you've got the residences one of the people that don't live here at all and I think the goal is is to make sure that uh the top tier residents that live here uh they they if if there's something available they get first dibs on it but we also want to be cautious not to ever have an empty slip I guess so if we just can't rent the thing go down the list and offer it to the guy that does not live here I do disagree with the statement it's I know it has to be resident owners period end-all they got the money they bought the house they are part of our community a renter so I'm saying if you can't rent it he's saying it's not if it's if it's not filled up and this is what he was referring what's that what's the chances of that like you said years ago there was problems retina slips there's yes years ago they had a lot of open slips and that's how the non-residents got in you had two residents here said I think the ones that he waited seven years to get his slip yeah if I remember I mean we must be going back Bill Lusk they don't go away once one gets in there they generally stay for a long time is that right right yes yeah so especially now um and that's something we need to address also if we do have to rent to somebody that's a non-resident um maybe there's a limit on how long they can actually rent it but these are things that we'll cover and I understand where everyone's going with this and and I I think that uh we also have another resource that will consult and I'm sure everyone knows who it is and we'll we'll drag him into the conversation and see if he has any input once we come up with our you know it's pretty cool yeah any other discussion on that topic right we are moving right along now finally uh sure I'm sure that Brooke has been waiting for a while um we are now on to discussing uh conversion to park mobile so uh let's see here council members able you have the floor and then uh okay as last meeting we had uh you wanted to see some numbers and we had an estimate built up um two things I guess before we go into that is not on this estimate is a cost of about I think it was like seven to nine thousand dollars that's expended by uh our current city manager in terms of time repair costs Etc and what parkmobile cannot put in the rest of it is the amount of time that instead of overhauling machines that Kyle or his replacement will now be in City Hall for that amount doing City Hall work instead of out in the field doing Machinery work and two um this is the time to see just what the pain threshold is for those that want to park here our residents are safe they have the parking decals that are good to go in fact Park Mobile gives us the ability look if we put in our citizens license plates they're clean they don't get charged but moving this to five dollars an hour from four hopefully in some ways reduce the traffic to these parking areas freeing up the parking spaces for our citizens that would like to use these nice little mini parks and then we can adjust from there obviously it's very easy to do but definitely move it up to five and that said um I don't know how do we bring up Brooke I and I the problem is there's two Brooks by the way uh through all these emails back and forth what Brook bustle Brook Krieger indeed got it would you like to step up to the podium so we can see you and uh that makes me feel a lot better now to be a resource so you tell me what you need um I can give you kind of an overview if you want me to um so Park Mobile is the uh we're a payment app so I started as an app isn't just an app anymore now there's text to pay um you can scan a QR code there's a lot of ways to pay now so not necessarily just an app but we're in Clearwater Beach we're in Clearwater we're in St Pete St Pete Beach Tampa all over Florida um so I don't think you'll have any trouble converting um if you even go that route um I I think we kind of spoke about it I think you should do more of uh a phased approach keep your kiosks out there add some stickers allow people to start paying digitally that have both options and then what they can do with the park mobile app is if they've used anywhere else in the Bay Area um they've used the app they know how to use it and maybe they already have an account but they can pay through any major credit card PayPal Apple pay uh Google pay so there's a lot of options there and for anyone who doesn't have a smartphone of course kiosks are still there but then there's also 1-800 number so they can call that as well there was a question uh from some people saying does parkmobile kind of in a sense advertise hey you know come look at this this parking space um there were fears that by going to park mobile we would get more people kind of overriding all our parking lots yeah so listening to the last hour and a half I realized we don't want more people coming here which you can't say for a lot of uh the beach towns that we work with usually we really want to we want to increase the parking rate we want more people to come here because it's more money for the city but I realize you guys are a little different but what we can do for that is um so with the park mobile app um as anyone familiar has everyone kind of seen it used to what a payment app looks like who has the app right now does anybody use it other okay us three and that's yeah okay I'm using a napkin yeah so we pull from Google Maps so picture your um your Google Map like you would use on your phone for GPS and stuff so that's what we pull from so you're gonna see all the same landmarks that you'll see so churches uh Library schools restaurants Etc um and then on there are little pinpoints of those Zone numbers The Zone numbers uh equate to maybe a street block or a lot and you're in your case um and that's what the Zone numbers would be on the map so anyone who has the app will be able to see those pinpoints for those different zones which would be your Lots but what we discuss is hiding those so what we can do is not put those pen points so someone who's just across the bridge or something won't see that um otherwise maybe they're looking for parking they're circling around different areas but then they see your lots available they're coming here right um that might not happen but say it does um what we can do is hide them from the map so no one else can see them but what that means is anyone on site so they pull into the lot and normal people who are coming here they can still see the signs and yeah obviously they'll certain signs so people can still pay um but we're not you know marketing it necessarily I also like the ability you have a dashboard so far if I want to throw a party and I really don't want a lot of people on the street bothering my neighbors I have the again we're talking about the marina is it possible for me to provide who's ever running the dashboard here it's you know one of the same people it's a computer interface to type in the list of license plates and the duration and time so that they don't get charged just tell them hey parking at the marina and we've entered into the system I've got them here for four hours for a group of people well we have a uh for uh one of the citizens here just wants to host a party but Park people in the marina and that'll be one of the park Mobile locations but doesn't want to charge them for it you know you're in the city so can they provide a list of license plates to the city just input and there's it for on this date for you know from this period of time these license plates will not be ticketed what we would do in that case is a comp parking so a promo code essentially there you go so we would um you would work with our whoever your account manager is um and then you would say hey on this day um so we the way the promo codes work it's a specific percentage or dollar off to let's say 100 off in this case and then it's for a designated amount of time and then it's for a specific zone so a lot of us okay so that gives us the ability to take cars off our streets that we've never had before yep while providing the free parking to the people that are attending our party yeah and that would have to go through the city oh yeah no no but again it goes back to that dashboard really everything's managed here at the city they can do all the settings the changes anything we'll listen again but not a resident well I'm sorry but yeah City Hall so I have a question um it's been discussed that we're able to limit the amount of time that uh a person can pay to park um do they receive a warning before they do that it says hey not only can you only buy three hours but you can't renew is that possible yeah yeah so we can mirror whatever policies you have um so any time restrictions you have uh minimums or maximums um so you can restrict that for the entire city so maybe you have a two hour maximum if they Park here they can't just go you know to another lot you could have a two-hour Max for the entire city or you could have a two or Max for this lot and then they would need to go somewhere else okay and then uh what about time restrictions uh and so you can't park here after um maybe at sunset uh you could have a hard stuff yeah okay or whatever hours or um and then whatever that hard stop means to you in some cases it means free parking starts at 5 PM um sometimes it means no parking starts at 5 PM so whether that's a No Parking Zone at a certain time or a free parking um same thing for a weekend so maybe your weekends are free you could either do no parking on weekends or free parking on weekends and the sheriffs right now they're actually all able to do this and they're very experience with it in this area yeah yeah so we already work with a number of cities in Pinellas County so they already know how to use the back-end system um and then if you have any third-party handheld system um probably jump into that as well see what the the problem we were running into and the reason why we're so strict is because it was cheaper to come to Bel Air beach and park your car here walk across the street then what you are charged at Clearwater Beach so people were leaving Clearwater Beach coming here parking their car lugging all their stuff over to the beach and staying there all day long and uh and we um really don't like that but that's the point of information they don't love their stuff they drop their stuff off and one person takes the car over here the designated driver is pretty much everything do you have a copy empty estimate with you or um not in front of me but do this because I mean that's probably the next question it's like okay what is the proposal so I do like your um explosion explanation earlier where you said we could actually um kind of bring it in and keep some of the same system we have in place because Kyle you had mentioned it one time early on that you were a little concerned I think that people that are familiar with and only bring cash and don't have the ability to have an app and all of a sudden poof it was a hundred percent already switched over that could be a problem for them so if we could um bring it in slowly or whatever term you used earlier so where it would maybe be a hybrid where people could use your system as well as still use paying cash or whatever they needed to park is that possible yeah yeah and we do that in a lot of cities usually what I say is um it's great because you have the it's just an added option right it's a no-cost added option but you're still you still have those costs associated with the kiosk so if your goal is to get rid of those costs from the kiosk you're not meeting that goal but you are adding additional options which is still okay but we work with a lot of um I think you have IPS right so we work with that kiosk system there's a number of them and what that when I say we work with them we can integrate our enforcement so our transaction data and their transaction data goes to the same place um so the team who's actually enforcing on the ground has one unit that they're looking at not multiple things okay but again the idea was trying to at least sure these people are expensive time to get them back in the city yeah that goes right back to the the whole argument for switching systems was that trying to solve a problem and I think that what we're doing is we're creating a problem by having two systems because now not only do you still have to maintain the old system but also the police well if if police or you know Wreckers or whatever it is whoever's monitoring and making sure that we're behaving or the the people that are parking or behaving themselves they're not going to know they will have to physically get out of their vehicle and go walk the cars to see if there's a ticket whereas with the the system the park mobile app you look at a license plate number and there it is so that there's pros and cons to both of uh both both ways I think for the the residents the people that live here I don't think it's any problem because you pay five bucks or six bucks or whatever it is these days and get your decal and you you just it's too detailed yeah you get your decal um it's just a matter of how do we want to treat people that are coming to Bel Air Beach to use harm Beach that's way say look we gotta implement the system I mean frankly I like to just crank it all over do it move directly over to parkwayville and two five dollars an hour Council yes Mr Banks how do we get how do we reconcile getting paid um is there a printout every month with every license plate that paid and how long yeah so on the enforcement side it's uh instantaneous you'll get the constant need of everyone who's paid so you can enforce um but as far as the remittance we process the payments we charge our credit card processing for that Merchant piece um to our vague um and then we pay you monthly is pretty easy we know each license plate that parked there because the reason I ask you is because I I take Uber and and lift a lot of times and this is way before Park Mobile came up I'm not a shy guy so I'll talk to anybody and I got told by a lot of Lyft drivers especially Lyft drivers that at the end of the month when I get paid I'm missing routes that I that I serviced and then they have to call lift up and then get into arguments and some of these guys have just said I'm not going to do what deal with Lyft anymore Uber's a lot more friendly so what I'm saying is how do I know that we're getting our we're getting Park mobiles being officially responsible and paying us for every park car yeah so you'll have access um probably not you guys directly but whoever's managing parking will have access to the back-end system um so you'll be able to pull your own Financial reports and you can match that um typically someone in accounting Finance would match that with what we would have meant to you um yeah that system would be right right over there yeah I'm just saying I mean yeah so you'll have access on your dashboard and then you can match that with what we send you you'll enjoy the dashboard um so you want to go to the estimate I mean because we nobody really knows the numbers right now and that's really where a big benefit comes up so um so I guess the overall cost um we don't cost anything for you to set up so we'll provide all of the signs uh the Integrations all of that good stuff so we'll set up the system for you our fee is on to the end user so it's 35 cents if they're doing five dollars 5.35 it's pretty simple amount there um and then the only thing the city would be on the hook for is the credit card processing fees um that we charge and that's three percent plus 20 cents um which I think is a little different because I think what you currently pay I don't know if it's on here I think it was like a flat four or five percent so in some smaller transactions um it was uh worst deal and then some of the high records it averaged out around the world yeah yeah yeah it depends on me we estimated a difference of 121. 535 in the gallery credit card processities how are these machines powered solar powered or do we have to provide Electric electrical or it's it's completely digital it's on everyone's bones so as long as I'm talking about the the oh uh you're right there's nothing there there's no opinion it's a sign I'm still lost in uh yeah in the clouds on the two systems yeah okay um but yeah anyone can pay as long as they have internet access um and if they don't have internet internet access they can call the 100 number Council we could potentially the bottom line and I think okay what the obvious questions are first of all how much did we make last year and then really the net um and then West Park Mobile going to deliver in terms of Revenue and then remember one Delta that Park Mobile cannot put in there is the time that we're wasting you know we give cattle a raise got the new guy that we're taking them out of the parking Arena putting them back in City Hall so what was the the numbers again I think we had them on there so we're projecting a total gain of six thousand two hundred nine dollars um and that's just the difference of the maintenance because the credit card processing kind of is a wash there's a like a hundred dollar loss they're um and then the gain is the which is your maintenance costs um but that was just the machine maintenance what you're paying directly to the kiosk company so I don't think that's factored into what you guys are paying for it yeah so you're looking at a a net revenue increase of about six thousand dollars going over the new system and then add in the saved time um Auto you know we're paying him mileage et cetera all that good stuff on top of that and then finally that's at four bucks an hour um I think the mayor was talking earlier well sometimes we don't want people here fine paint threshold let's see what their willing customers willing to pay move it to five and then that increase just you know and I had to move that to five we'd move the other to five right no we're just no it I mean why wouldn't we move it to five dollars an hour if we had the current system in place you should do that anyway yeah that's a good point what I've always said just keep raising until they quit coming yeah but the point is you got to get these guys out of the field they should be here not all the crap that goes on trying to fix the system in the arena kiosk if I hear hear you say there's a 35 cents an hour fee that goes to Port mobile or it's just flat so 35 cents for um however long page transaction I think that should be taxed on to if it's five dollars and charge them like five five ten an hour or what you know what I'm saying to recover that 35 cents what is our uh obligation uh what's the time span we're obligated to try this system out uh you're not obligated to do anything um as far as what your time resources would be to implement the surface no I'm just asking if we if we decide to go this route how long are we committing to let's just say we it doesn't work for Bel Air Beach or we lose revenue or who knows what definitely won't lose Revenue if anything you'll increase it's just a question of how much because typically it's easier to extend your time because you can do it from your phone instead of having to come back to the Kia so you're going to see more transactions because of that our standard contract term is three years um so I would say three years we can go down or up depending on what you do cities some cities do five some do a year just to try it out if you want um but again there's no upfront costs so you're not really losing anything by adding it that's my sales pitch well and you can have a I mean contracts are to be negotiated I'm the procurement guy so it could be three years or ten years if you have a termination for convenience Clause you could give them their 30 days notice and they're gone not to undercut here so obviously it's successful just about everywhere now um my uh my thoughts are as if we switch we won't switch back but uh uh we are we're on a hard break 7 30. um can we take 10 yeah thank you important thanks oh got it all in in 10 minutes too amazing they're fishing two courses of happy birthday all right we're back and uh we're we're right back on to the park mobile discussion um does anyone else have other questions uh before I survey the group see if we have a consensus on this I have a couple questions I'm I'm making an assumption that these numbers these hours came from our actual data that we have pulled from our current I'm 20 22 is that right it was uh the last fiscal Year's data I used okay full fiscal year then we charge different rates at different locations right now is that right is it I mean it so I I thought the beach was a little more expensive it used to be not anymore now it's uh four dollars during the week and I believe it kicks up the five on the weekends yeah and that's all of our parking areas um that yeah that's all the parts right now it's four dollars right it's four dollars right now and this this lot you can technically pay for parking uh 24 hours every other lot has restrictions on it what are the limits what are the market rati options on the others so Morgan Park's nine o'clock closes it opens at um 6 A.M and then uh base that part is I believe sticks to I have to check that I believe it's 11. is Bayside do we have though I thought Morgan was going to have a limit on how long you could park there too is that not the case it does well it has a limit of how much you can pay for it one time and you can come back and put more in right you can pay up to three hours but people can come back and with the thought process they can only stay three or thought was we were trying to get them in it I just remembered this being so we didn't have the pet peeve on previous Council about making sure really allowed them to stay a certain amount we we did we wanted to make it inconvenient so they had to keep coming back and moving the feeding the meter right yeah with Park Mobile we can actually limit the total time they can park during that day um as opposed to with the cash meters we couldn't restrict that they could come back and pay another three Morgan uh Morgan Morgan Park didn't work because it coincided with bathroom breaks yeah so what about holidays do we have an option to charge Chevron holidays or no on the current meters um we could set that up in the programming okay we never did no yes so Kyle it sounds like uh so just making the assumption that the revenue is not going to be less than what we're getting how do you feel as a city manager which what's your preference I lean towards um the park mobile okay I believe that's the way everything's gonna eventually be um and it makes sense and a lot of first-hand experience with dealing with the The Meters that we have now and the maintenance got it yes uh Mr bankert not not to get off the subject but Morgan Park wasn't it originally I think the vice mayor once told me before she was vice mayor that weren't we supposed to have dedicated like four spots we had two we had two dedicated spots two what was it four original I thought there were two but there's none now that's right can't we go back to getting something like that for residents that live around there and put four dedicated spots in there I think the reason we didn't was because we had we got State money or federal money to fix it to fix Morgan Park and so you couldn't discriminate I was told it was because of beetry nourishment and I'm like at this point if we're not getting Beatrice I'll take our spaces back yeah that's right that's right yeah you'll never get those spaces I think it was only a 10-year agreement though so after we don't get Beatrice nourishment then I thought those easements were oh well you're talking about the part never mind yeah the easements that's forever yeah yeah okay all right any other questions I have a comment um on break I checked with my resident expert about the credit card processing fee if Park Mobile serves as merchant of record and my resident expert stated that's a good deal it locks in a rate that can't fluctuate so food for thought if going with Park Mobile versus looking at another merchant services provider yeah uh my my thoughts on this is uh we probably the revenue will temporarily go down for the regulars because people are gonna I don't have the app you know and then they're bad and you know whatever but uh I think eventually everyone will that uses Our Lives will they'll just download the app everybody uses apps for everything and uh except Kyle he doesn't only when I need to I'll keep it on my phone uh anyway I'm I'm all for this uh if uh if the the council is so uh yeah Wesley I wasn't for it but if Kyle is a city manager says he's in favor but I'll go with him okay vice mayor I'm definitely in favor of it I just think we need to revisit power pricing parking and I think uh uh you know we'll we have to vote on this anyway we'll have to uh to uh approve you to sign your contracts so uh we'll have something more definitive in writing and and a preview before how long do you think will this be the next meeting or uh or do you need longer or Brookwood I think um we can well it depends on how you want to procure um so you can piggyback off of any of the contracts going on right now um in Pinellas County we're actually negotiating a contract uh currently that should be done pretty soon in Pinellas County for the county parks um so you could probably just piggyback off of that one um or we can do a direct agreement um whatever makes the most sense but obviously all of those options uh different timing admin for you guys we'd prefer to piggyback for our purchasing policy yeah but if they already have uh local contracts in place yeah the next meeting if there's nothing restricting you I think it could be on the next meeting agenda and once we have a uh enough warning and we can read the contract then I I think more than likely we won't have a problem and if we do we'll we'll stall it until we get it worked out that satisfy you I think that's great I just do we need to talk about how that what that pricing looks like so that uh when we get the contract signed we can move forward right away or well we then have another meeting to vote Racing for your parking well that you're not committing to pricing for your parking to them you're just committing we get 35 cents whatever I know no that my question was along those lines if we want to implement as quickly especially with spring break coming do we want to hash out those the cost of parking now so once we get the contract signed we can implement it as quickly as possible I think that's all done on the app which will be in there he just goes up the machine and goes there's your new one right there start it the counselor she's asking for a concession on the rates we're going to charge and and that's where um uh we don't want to do that during a regular council meeting we want to know in advance what we're doing uh so part of what gets on the next agenda you know in other words if we're approving that we're approving the price of parking and we just proposing something for right right now or I think Mike did but knowing that we're already charging five dollars on the weekend I didn't know that yeah then probably if you go in that dollar more than six on weekends five and weekdays yeah and holidays and throwing holidays there because right now Clearwater gets fifty dollars for the day you know when they parked fifty dollars a day to park it you know some of the beach hotels and some of them um uh some some of them they'll six dollars an hour in big and then all the words a little tiny after you've reached the point of commitment and you can't turn around minimum three hours and I'm good with having that as the base six bucks base and yeah I mean 15 bucks a lot I mean go go through there I do I think six dollars is cheap on uh sorry can I interrupt I don't know um I uh Kyle and I were crunching some numbers if we moved the estimate to a five dollar per hour rate instead of the four dollar if you're following along on the sheet that first number you see in the first paragraph that 832 the average transaction um we would turn that into 10.52 so we're adding two dollars because that's an average two dollars that would make your total credit card Revenue 227 814 um instead of that 181 that you're seeing um so less all the fees and all the math mods I'll give this back to you so you can have it in front of you that's a total increase in revenue of 19 about 40 000 that you can expect so your total credit card net after RV would be 216 instead of that I think 178. I have no problem with the five dollar an hour rate except for the people that walk that walk the bridge in the early mornings parking lot's not full and they're doing something healthy and I I don't down there is another story but here I think I think that a slightly reduced rate in the wee hours of the morning while they're walking the bridge I have no problem with that at all I I had proposed that we do like downtown St Pete does that you don't start paying until nine o'clock or something along those lines yeah I got blasted by residents so I'm just telling you that so well I um I don't have a problem with that either but I want to make sure that we're all on the same page so I'm I'm up for a reduced rate or a no rate up till it becomes attractive to the beach right and so uh thoughts what do you think I like that no rate Dollars during the week Monday through Fridays update free okay but the residents would pay nothing right that's right and it also gives them the option you can provide a list of license plates sure get so it gets people off our streets and park over there for free okay so um let's uh let's jot this down right quick beginning eight o'clock uh Monday through Friday it's free uh before eight at City Hall yeah uh free here and then uh after eight it's five dollars an hour yeah is that right Monday through Friday five bucks an hour until what time so this one's 24 isn't it yeah so what I'm saying is we don't want people parking here at nine o'clock at night and eating their quarter for eight o'clock in the morning yeah there's big time yeah yeah so what's what's our cut off currently at night okay so when do we want to either stop or switch over to a free uh free rape 4 a.m to 4 a.m to 8 A.M four to eight yeah and then the rest of the time up till four o'clock in the morning it's five dollars an hour okay and we should have we should have a substantial increase on a weekend rate all right and I'm not talking about holidays yeah like seven ten bucks an hour you know at least at Morgan Park ten dollars an hour is not unreasonable all it is yeah holidays and we can spend dollars an hour what you you go around the other parking lots they're getting it they're getting it okay right now I'm I'm dealing with here so uh it's free from uh 4 a.m to 8 A.M and then from 8 A.M to 4 a.m it's five dollars an hour and on the weekend do we want to change do we want a different rate just for here here and the beaches well okay separate here from there because it's really is two separate entities but on the weekend they use this parking lot for one reason to go to 12th Street or 6th Street but we cancel the holidays or to play tennis we're talking residents can play tennis all they want because they got sure there's a decals when they walk uh so ten dollars an hour um just uh so it's five dollars down there during the week we just make it all the same and then uh on the weekends it's ten dollars an hour yes 10 an hour and holidays we could change it later on if we wanted to but let's give that a shot see what the see what the pain threshold is yeah and again because these people are not citizens we're a residential Community we don't have hotels you're probably not trying to bring in Revenue I think this is a good way of absolutely that's why I approach it a lot yeah yeah holidays and weekends Miss Livingstone yes sir I I see you laughing okay so what what what's your thoughts on these rates no I'm in complete agreement um you know we the whole idea of having Bel Air Beach and living here is for the residents to enjoy so um weekends holidays ten dollars and and the rest of the time the proposed was at six yeah so okay and we have what is our operating hours at Morgan Park uh 6 a.m to 9pm to 9 p.m yes okay and Okay so the weekends here because we're open 24 hours are you still charging ten dollars per hour all night long yes yeah you good with that I guess we'll have a try and see what happens okay I mean I know definitely the beach I'm fine with it and the marina for overflow Beach parking but you know here I kind of go but it's still the same thing yes I'm gonna say yes okay convince yourself it's City Hall do we all do we allow them pay to go longer than three hours so Saturday morning at 4 00 a.m the rate increases to ten dollars per hour Saturday morning oh yeah that's what I was talking about that's why I was saying the Walkers here ten dollars an hour to walk our bridge I'm still doing them for four to eight yeah okay so there's still the the four to eight uh seven news okay and that was we said free right right from four to eight it's getting confusing here um do we do we have a time limit for three hours at this lot or do we allow because we don't have a um I I would say this whole problem here you know if we're charging ten dollars an hour and they want to pay it I'm gonna stay all day we became friendly yeah well we're looking for ways to increase revenue and if it turns out it's a problem we can always dial it back that's right um but uh so depends seven days a week between eight and eight uh four a.m and 8 A.M these two lots are free down there uh it's five dollars Monday through Friday but Saturday and Sunday it's ten dollars an hour after 8 A.M all day long till 4 a.m it's ten dollars an hour here on the weekends and holidays yep yeah everybody good with that yeah yes sir so did we just and that can be done by resolution right um so we can do that um I could bring it as an agenda item once I have the contract all put together and um and you guys can vote okay so it'll be two separate items if uh let me double check I don't think we did the parking fees by a resolution I think they were just sagged by Council I think I think the last time we did the rate my resolution but I'll check that out um yeah I I just want to make sure that they're well obviously the uh um they would have to be completely separate anyway because otherwise the other one would have to be modified every time we wanted to change the race in the marina yes okay uh any last questions for Miss Brooke here we just uh Frank just brought up a pretty good points that we talked about those overnight Runners and they park over in the marina because there's no available parking there hey yeah gotcha yeah all right there's always something yeah a new way of looking at things by the way thank you for coming down from Atlanta we appreciate it because she was up in the last year oh come on she got a free trip to see your parents [Laughter] cool all right uh so now Justin yeah okay cool yeah thank you again thank you it's been very nice meeting you all right now we are on to item number five uh this one was placed on the agenda by council member Robert something about discussion of placement of bricks at the community center for the Bel Air Beach Community Foundation brick program be something great yep and I know I know this is not our particular project but my only concern is um and kind of so right now we have enough bricks with people's names on them for one rectangular section is that correct uh yes uh yeah so so we've got that set up so what I want to avoid if possible is uh let's say Frank signs up tomorrow and it may take four months before we get a large enough section of bricks to take care of that rectangular removal of concrete so here's my proposal because I don't want to see that happen so somebody's waiting I paid for my brick why am I not seeing it you know we don't know how long it's going to take it's unknown for that for the if we're taking out a whole section of concrete right so here's what my proposal is they do have we do have to have something in the contract that said that they uh bbcf would not request a brick installation for more than more than one time in six months so we do know that's going to be a six month period you're gonna have to wait and that wasn't for maintenance purposes well here's a suggestion that I that I think may work better um and I don't know exactly how the process is going to work for the people that actually do the engraving on the brick but if this is my world I would go ahead so right now we have a section we're going to take out on the sidewalk right yes we're going to put the bricks in there beautiful so that's perfect so now I would already have the sex second like that is where we took the idea um and the reasoning for this being um our first which we designed is slightly different um with the the bbcf uh you know Memorial brick or whatever in the middle this is a plan to have 20 of the regular sized bricks plus the BBC up in the middle okay um the reason we we went with this idea is because um it was a new program we didn't know exactly what the demand for the bricks were going to be of course to kind of establish something that we could commit to and that's what it was sold on well that even makes I think my thought better so we're not taking out a complete section of the sidewalk just the center of it basically based on that picture yes or at least the first set we're that was just the idea we can always change design all right anyway right but what I would do then for that next segment I would go ahead and cut that out now and put the bricks in there without the names on it and so then Frank signs up we take a brick out take it to the engraver yeah the engraver does the work we put that baby back in there safe in the interim yeah that's and there it is that's how IRB has it because yeah because when I got a brick down there yeah it was installed and probably listened less than three weeks yeah I think it makes sense just so that um we're not waiting six months you know somebody's already forked out the 250 bucks or whatever it is can't remember what it is um so now it's taken care of I mean right away because um the uh Foundation has already bought the bricks so they're put in place and then I'm assuming they have an engraver right so you just pull the brick out and tell them okay I'm bringing a new brick over here's how we want it done they ship the bricks engraved so we we would just have dummy bricks yeah in the meantime correct okay okay so we could do that and again it's not that many bricks that we could have dummy bricks in there the Botanical Garden sounds it sounds to me like it would be kind of sloppy right because you're pulling a brick out and you're putting one in and then you're and and they're going to be variations whereas if you did them all at one time it's a nice move it's not really that it's not a tricks you just you take a paper out you put another whoops you put the sand in you can pack it put the the other paper right back there you don't know the difference they're not uh they're floating no there should be tamped it you should have them at least it's a three to four inch base tan okay and then when you're just you're just popping bricks yeah you just have a little hook and then you have to re-sand the top but that's that's minimal yeah I just think it would be I don't want people to have to wait that long it just it kind of loses the impact like Frank says so he participated in one down the road why are we are a couple weeks yeah you had your brick in there and you you walked on it and showed people and said hey look at my break well let me get this straight you you take the burden of the meters off of them and then you give him bricks back [Laughter] a lot more time putting in bricking yeah how many have they sold right now that I think they've done the full 20. and that's going to take up that one rectangular yeah section perfect they have more than 20 a couple more I don't know okay and but we should all be telling people about this and making sure that all of our buddies are buying bricks yeah absolutely I think I got one I bought again I want the whole sidewalk I forget the grandkids all right just just an idea so I think so you're saying the same company that we buy the bricks from also does the Engraving but they do it yeah they do it all at once and then ship the brick okay well the ship uh there's a minimum amount but it's free shipping at that point so it has to do with that as well I wonder why we don't get the bricks engraved locally machine I can tell you why it's because that's the whenever they went online and they looked around that's they found a company that could do it and uh and they had the website to support it and it was ready to go is that right yes yeah okay so it was uh the least amount of trouble for sure the amount of people that are on the um uh the foundation okay that was my thought I just wanted to speed up the process for people getting a break okay so um like we said we'll we'll uh we'll look into depending on how fast these bricks are selling but if if bricks are selling quicker we'll look for a way to um like he was saying I have actual space done and then be able to pop it out yeah because it's pretty easy to do that you know just saying it's just saying let's put more sand up so you're volunteering sure I'll do it right cool come on a little screwdriver any other discussion on the bricks before we move on to our last item yeah okay uh we are on to item number six discussion of right angle turn located at 19th Street and Bayside Drive this is placed on the agenda by city manager reefler yes I placed this on the agenda because I and I included an email correspondence with a resident who lives in the area of 19th Street and Bayshore Drive um who I met three months ago for the first time and he had said that he's expressed his concern about this corner for a very long time um and he his main thing is that he he sees the cut through traffic um primarily people just trying to get around quicker and um taking this right angle turn you know as fast as they've pinned um a lot of times coming out of the actual side of the road at their Lane they're supposed to be in um there's no line of sight issue with that corner but the speeds that that he describes people taking the turn does present a danger if somebody was locking their dog or just walking in General on the street coming around the corner or another car trying to do the same thing and uh it sets up a bad situation so I told them I would look into it and um that's you can see in the email I I talked to the uh some Public Works departments I talked to Traffic Engineers I talked to our contracted engineer just to get some ideas the general consensus was um he proposed a stop sign where when I asked opinions to to the professionals I talked to um they told me that it is not in the recommendation um for for the national recommendation for traffic signs to use a stop sign or a yield sign as a speed control device so um my final reach out was to an engineering company and they said that they would in their mind and they offered me free advice about it having to pay them anything but they said that they would they would uh they would if they did a study there they wouldn't be recommending a stop sign so I was based on the information I had um I emailed back um telling them like I feel more comfortable progressively stepping it up to maybe get to a stop sign but I didn't feel like jumping right to a stop sign was was ideal um and what I was basically recommending was something like this um and uh you know he was asking about the speed I told him I wouldn't drove it in 10 miles an hour seemed like a good speed to if you were just driving normally and something that you didn't expect happened you'd be able to stop and you make that turn at 10 miles per hour yes yeah that's what he did yeah yeah you could make it faster but it wouldn't be safe because it's it's just a left turn yeah or right the hammer is pretty good it's widened enough but there's no right turn you're turning into someone yeah if you're going the opposite because we put an island in there we got Islands at the end of some of our streets those islands have created more problems you take that turn and there was a there was a traffic calming policy I think before I got on Council in 2020 which has independix a in it which provides a host of different things to you know curb traffic going into neighborhoods some of them were speed tables which they don't want you know you might want to do a speed table at the crosswalk rather than on the street so when you're turning on there you're going to have to go up a little bit ramp it might deter people um a stoplight somewhere in there um it's our street I think it is I think we can put it can't does that dot really get involved if we put a stoplight on that street someplace not on our private road that's what I'm saying so okay I I'm aware that there's a problem uh going down uh Bayside Drive or not Bayside but Bayshore um they do fly down that road and they'll do rolling stops across um 22nd yeah and they'll just keep on trucking um the the problem is is that we've been down this road vice mayor Shirley uh was we we've had this conversation Frank has been part of this conversation this is not anything new but the minute that you try to do something to curb the speed people don't want it so they want everybody else to slow down but they don't want to be inconvenienced with speed tables speed home speed uh you know anything like that they also don't want the the radar signs that light up whenever you're going too fast I figured that one out because we get some back signs we did some survey they they don't like that um the uh I like the idea of the know through uh sign I think that that's a good idea and I wouldn't mind seeing those on on more on more of our streets uh because there's going to be a uh maybe one vacation or a year who's going to read that sign and I actually heed to it and go oh I'm not turning down there because it says no through um so that's something to consider and as far as the uh stop sign goes I don't think that I would if if you're looking both directions I would not consider putting one making the right turn on the 19 because I don't think the majority of people are cutting through there to avoid traffic because it's an inconvenience to make a left turn off of Gulf Boulevard get into that neighborhood then head south and then you still have to fight traffic to get back out into it it's only convenient for people heading to Clearwater Beach so if we did a stop sign at all only the one approaching uh Bayside would be the only one that I would even consider yeah and I wouldn't have a problem with that at all but I'm really surprised somebody's not ran through that intersection right into the bushes right the house or the house yeah yeah I think it's um I mean I live right on 20th Street so Kyle and I talked about it a little bit previously and I've looked at it multiple times so I think everybody understands what we're talking about here so if you're coming off of there's there's actually two problems in my view you're coming um becoming North on Gulf Boulevard and you take a right on 19th Street and it goes down and there's and there's a house there in the corner and the only way you can go at that point is left onto Bayside so people have a tendency right there to also be going too fast and not make the 19 so they kind of just cut the Apex so they just they just make a soft turn into there yeah so they have an opportunity to have a head-on would somebody come in the other direction right because they're not really thinking it through well also you have somebody heading south on Bayside and they're making the right hand turn because Bayside dead ends into 19th so they also are going too fast typically and they're swinging too wide so they're on the wrong side of 19. and that's where the two head-ons can happen so I don't think it's 100 due to when we have the heavy traffic it's just normal time you know people just going home or whatever they're doing and they're cutting that corner both directions and they could hit other cars and or they could hit people that are walking with their dogs and that type of thing so I just wanted to make that point that it's not really necessarily due to the time when we have heavy Beach traffic going to clear water because that's a whole other issue when I was campaigning somebody said yeah people come down here and they're they're avoiding the traffic on Gulf Boulevard and they're flying on whatever roads are parallel to the intercoastal yeah and they're just flying down that road and that's what was talking to this guy somebody came by and like a Juiced up Ford Mustang going about 65 years right down the road and I thought wow I mean if somebody a kid went out in front no way no way they're getting out of the way in time uh but this doesn't have anything to do I don't think with the heavy Beach traffic um stuff that's going on this is normal where he has a problem with this it's more the people who live there who are used to that corner right correct one thing I can tell you about that intersection is that if you're if you think you're doing yourself a favor by going down the 19th making a right turn and coming out on the Gulf Boulevard and that's not the best place to pull out at and I think you're you're gonna get out and faster if not this time of year more North you go I'm good hibiscus and still yeah because those are the Northside Bayshore and hibiscus they come back and then just because it um it's in there crossing just right just right close to there 19th Street yeah those are nine okay well that's my point is that um it's difficult to get out of there anyway and so I think the people that live here um are probably maybe some of them are going down there but not it can't be that many not like it is I mean just the people that live on that street probably so probably so um but that that's why I was in favor of one stop sign and not two because I didn't think the one at the very end was necessary unless cars start running into the guy's yard there um which I don't think we've seen that yet so you're saying put it on on Bayside and put it on at the end of 19 in the 19th okay so you make it a left-hand turn yes look and make them laughs and and that would be my recommendation but uh according to Kyle sources they're saying yeah that's not going to help anything well it how could it not slow down traffic it's they're just saying it's not recommended I you know I feel like I can see your point you know as you stop traffic and then it's a matter of like enforcing it as well um and and uh you were not in the meetings at the time but um it's in several of you weren't but whenever we did have these conversations about well what can we do about Speeders um I think because occasionally this comes up you have somebody gets overly vocal it's fully Justified what they're complaining about but their neighbors aren't they don't get buying from the neighbors and so I think the last time we had this conversation about changing anything uh where it was a flashing light or a speed table or anything to do that it's a it's a it's a inconvenience to drive down your own Street it would require petition and they would have to to Lobby their neighbors and everybody would have to agree that okay let's take this to the council and let them vote on it because otherwise we don't know what we're talking about and then would it make sense to do a traffic study I mean this is always the time of the year where we get these same complaints and but that is in an intersection we've done a study on it they could you know put some speed indicators out there and see if you know how fast people are making that turn is it really interesting did have the sheriff do one of their boxes um they did not find speaking to the issue but that's because you really can't go around that corner yeah that's impressive yeah it'd be interesting to see what the average speed was going around the corner or something like that you did give me some numbers I can I'll share that with you that would be awesome to see I mean yeah all my tires I'll show you another thing is is uh it's the guy that's complaining is he to the right of the intersection but there's our 19th not right on the corner but a little bit to the West would it be the second house if you start at the very corner of the great big house is it the one next door so if you're um at 19th and Bayshore it would be not the one on the North West corner of the turn um it would be on the north side of 19th up one from the house right on okay all right because it could turn out that he's asking you to or you know we decided to put a stop sign in somebody's yard that just lose their minds because now they've got a great big stop sign right next to their driveway or something so that's something to consider also look at the the lot line um typically we'll put it right on the lot line if possible so it's not need somebody to front yard yeah now you get to hear all the trucks stopping and stuff all night long the Mustang I think Kyle's idea of kind of stepping it makes sense you know so if you want to start with something that's less than a stop sign and see if that has a positive impact on people driving like letting them know hey slow down to 10 miles an hour because you're coming up on a 90 degree turn and if you don't slow down to 90 10 miles an hour you're going to have difficulty making that turn cleanly without pulling into the other lane and that's the problem well you still have uh you know somebody's still going to get a big sign right you know right there at that house and uh where the walking path used to be it'll be fine yeah and that's true the warning sign doesn't need to be exact like a stop sign does okay right it can be further up you know I definitely like the idea of the know through traffic because it can't hurt no I talked to the Sheriff Deputy and he said that um we put we can put you know through traffic signs but and they can stop vehicles that are that they suspect are through traffic but they will not be able to issue a citation unless we change our ordinance for something that they can reference I I think this Council would have no problem doing that I would be in favor of starting out with what the sheriff's office has recommended the arrow in the 10 miles per hour sign see if that helps it gets kind of change the ordinance and a change to the ordinance I don't know if we have to change our ordinance for that enforcement no for the through traffic yeah that's where the no through well see it's a two two uh two section approach as you're turning into 19 immediately they see that no three traffic sign and then they get down to the end and you've got to slow down to make that left turn uh I think it'd be something worth looking into and and then if we we wanted to change the ordinance to support the signs after they were in I I would not be opposed to that at all yeah Council I like that I'd just like to say pick up uh hibiscus as well because that's another straight through oh yeah down my start there and then they don't know where to go they just start flying down hibiscus trying to okay I checked into ways too and ways we'll go if it's a public Street they have to show it it comes from the same database so that's the two it's it's those two streets can you put a resonance only and delivery only sign with that is that lawful yeah it's all going to come out of enforcement right because the deputy is going to be like well you know okay now I got to make them prove that they're resident and then they're going to say wow you can actually tell a story and say no Outlet there's no Outlet on this road I'm gonna sit out there in high business it shows just water and it doesn't scream but no if you put like nine non-residents or not allowed we have to encourage those people to buy those Beach stickers on their cars and it's an easy thing for the sheriff to say hey they got the peach sticker yeah but that's the residential Road and so what are you going to do whenever Aunt Bessie comes to visit you and uh you know because she's not a resident and I'll just use Bel Air as I got pulled over in Bel Air going to my office you know because that uh Indian Rocks Road is closed and they said I rolled through a stop sign and didn't even get my driver's license you still live on Bellar Beach you know like he knew I didn't live in Bel Air probably part of the reason he pulled me over and didn't give me a ticket or anything but you know just uh you know two and that's probably we need to enforce the rolling through the stop sign at Bayshore in 20 seconds [Laughter] so yeah I think if you're coming to town I know you have that is an example that shows the left-hand turn yeah yeah I mean if I'm coming down um Bayside and I'm heading south that's the more difficult turn that's the bigger problem making the right hand turn because centrifugal force is pulling you out there you know you're going up to speed you're trying to make that turn you're out it's too late if you're coming down 19th heading towards intercoastal Canal again you're in the outside Lane that force is taking you out here less of an opportunity I think to cause a problem I think the bigger problem is uh Bayside slow that person down because they're making that 90 degree turn that's that's a tough return period I I mean I see what you're saying but also I mean if someone's trying to take a left hand turned fast from the outside Lane they're just going to cut that corner they could shy it should make it and drift out right but that's that's a definite decision they made to cut the corner the person that's making that right-hand turn to going 50 miles an hour they've already made the decision they're going too fast they're going to swing out they can't make the right hand turn thanks anyway I would like to hear what Kyle's uh suggestion is what what what is your recommendation where I was at if um my recommendation was would it be incrementally try to solve the problem and then if it's not working then reassess it and see what we're going to do I don't think the council has to vote to approve you putting a sign somewhere so what what are you doing exactly your which sign are you putting in and where's it going I would I would put a left turn and a right turn with a recommendation um of 10 miles an hour both both sides interactions okay um and then because you mentioned the no through signs I want to look into those and start with putting those signs up um and then move forward with an ordinance to be able to enforce and then what about um hibiscus hibiscus um which which part of hydrose well actually it goes from west to east it's it's a straight uh line through you had Bayshore across I think 21st and then it goes north south is hibiscus now where do they enter on on Harrison or where are they entering at so because yeah so you probably needed Harrison and then I mean I guess you could put it on Bayshore as well so you just try one though for now I mean okay well okay so you've got a you have a stop sign on hibiscus already stopping at Harrison to Harrison yes okay and what you uh and it's straight or you make a right turn on onto hibiscus so that's West and then you probably get the I passed and went across so I need to get to like you coming from Gulf Boulevard you have to take a feeder road to get to hibiscus so what is that feeder road is the no through traffic out at Gulf Boulevard at the feeder Road or is it on hibiscus I would say the no through traffic or just any any uh anyone entering off of Gulf Boulevard that's where they need to see the Note 3 traffic right on kind of like where we do the uh no parking on the street signs yeah yeah as you turn on the streets in those neighborhood watch signs they're probably not doing much you could rent those down while we're talking about signs I actually had someone on my street say could you tell that City to do something about these signs or all crooked it's great we got signs but they're all crooked so I'm just relaying that message okay I'm like why don't you call Kyle and talk to him no you need a level you guys are pretty good so the the no three traffic goes on Harrison one on 19 and then at the end of 19 in Bayside you've got that slow down yeah making turns all right everybody good with that yeah you're happy you're sure about this right yeah yeah just like that yeah I want to make sure all right and if it's I know if it is not getting the effect the desired I'm gonna hear about it okay so all right I think everybody's in agreement everybody good yeah all right are there green bus there okay uh we're on the item seven which is General business remember yes I'm sorry well we'll just roll this right into General business since yeah that's fine a while ago I had asked the council's uh permission to meet with the county on the infamous intersection up here at Gulf Boulevard and and uh Causeway right yeah so I did it just took me a long time so uh Kyle so I met with Tom Washburn and you know Tom right getting many good things to say about you so I talked about all the different things that I've heard from our citizens as well as things that I've seen personally at this intersection most recently I was coming from Indian Rocks Beach and I stopped right at the traffic when I first car there and when the uh left turn light came on of course we don't have the if the yellow light anymore blinking light that allows us to turn when we want to because there's no traffic coming so both lanes happen to be full and so I watched everybody as they were coming and making a left-hand turn to go on the bridge not one car out of I think eight I counted them that were in the right hand lane making a left-hand turn actually followed the 90 degree striping pattern that's not one every one of them cut it almost made contact every one of them with the people in the left the people on the left had to avoid and go into the cross yellow stripes to avoid contact and then they were like boom boom behind in front all the way through no contact was made but I'm a hundred percent convinced contact has been made there before we've asked I know the deputies before if they have any record of it and they say no and I know the reason for that is because if Frank and I touch each other and we pull over and we call 9-1-1 they're gonna say is anybody hurts and we say no they say okay we're not getting involved there's no report you and Frank share your information on insurance and you guys deal with it that's it so every time we ask the deputies and rightfully so they say yeah we have no record no problems well there are problems I guarantee you um the biggest problem is and another thing I've witnessed when I come in from 20th Street and I'm gonna and I multiple times during the day because we're watching grandkids I'm back and forth different times of the day the entire left-hand side fill us up before anybody gets into the right lane I'm all I always take the right lane because I want to experience that wonderful feeling when everybody looks at me and like flips me off you're not you're not getting it you know you're not going to get in on me because I see what you're doing and I'm not going to let you so we both make the turn and everybody just gets Bumper to Bumper and we have like a 17 inch merge lane you know in order to try to move over so it's just a disaster waiting when it happens so when I I had a great conversation um so we talked about some different ideas he did say that it's about time for this study to be done again it was done like two years ago so they typically like to follow it up they also have cameras where they don't even have to come out here and so they could they can watch it he can put a couple of guys and task them to sit there for two days and watch Cars turn and they'll see how that is working we also all know that different times of the year I know there's different flow patterns through there I asked him specifically because one of the ideas I had was I said okay Tom everybody that I've talked to wants the flashing yellow left-hand turn light back for obvious reasons we know we can't do that with two lanes so if we can get back to one single Lane and by doing so remove the median that's out there with oh the palm tree excuse me and we could just extend that bi-directional lane all the way down he goes yeah we can do that not a problem so there's no rules against that so people would just start backing up in that lane as necessary does that hurt people coming one of those streets trying to make a left turn onto well I talked to the residents about that before and they already handle that in this manner I talked to the people on 12th Street and which is close to the median already and they told me they don't go out on 12th Street we go down and we go to the 13th Street and come back on the other side and that additional block gives them enough space and he said and typically if it's local residents everybody's pretty um considerate and letting them get across either way um so he said I said well how would that process work if the city decides to do something like that he said again it's simple he said you guys own the palm tree and you own the light and you own the electrical that goes out there so you guys the city would come in first and remove those he said we could replay I don't think they want to remove that palm tree the palm tree the big palm tree yeah I think the presidents don't want that removed well that was already recommended in this initial stuff no but the residents there don't want that are you going to remove that whole medium the crosswalker correct it'll be just like Sixth Street we've all seen Sixth Street there's a crosswalk there well you're not going to limit yeah that was he brought this up and he says we really thought people would be okay just using the other life and it's horrible but he said no he said and I said yeah I don't want to I don't want to recommend any changes to the crosswalk that's already there because that's not going to be received well what he did say you know we could make that a uh get rid of the two lane turn that also helps the people that are going straight down towards Indian Rocks Beach because they're the ones that used to get held up because the people you know it was that short left-hand turn lane by removing the median and the bi-directional lane goes to Infinity and people will start moving over and getting in line and they could also put timing devices uh and change it based on the flow of traffic through there so they can make it last longer the left-hand turn lane as well and you'll also have the blinking yellow left-hand turn light specifically for the residents here because other ones that complain when they're going to work in the morning at 7 30 and they come in here to make a left-hand turn and there's no traffic as far as they can see and they have to sit there for a minute which seems like an hour of course it's just you know maybe 60 seconds okay for irritating and they're just on their first cup of coffee so it's not good so that that would fix that problem uh and he said Lloyd in a worst case scenario if you guys do that and you change your mind we just simply come back and put a curb in there he says but I don't think it's going to happen he says Indian Rocks Beach he offered this information he says they're actually doing that now they have similar medians with trees and lights he said they've told us to come back in and take them out well yeah so interesting I think those are dangerous because I don't think you can see around some of those trees Crossing I one time I had to admit this at night I was coming down and I moved over into the bi-directional lane for some reason I thought I was I don't know I guess past the median and I was thinking about something that's all of a sudden there it was Intrigue and I've had people behind the tree and also did pop out like whoa yeah so that's good so the meeting went well and and Kyle I just kind of want to you know turn it over to you um I told him I would get back you know and if council's okay with that and you could contact Tom okay and you guys could put together a plan uh he said you know obviously you're familiar with it they do the study they'll just do an update on this study to see the volume of traffic that's making the turns and they can actually look through the cameras and seeing how many people are using the right hand line lane how many people are sitting there in the traffic but he he kind of agreed that if we got rid of that and just extended that bi-directional lane people would just naturally start moving over you know there's a lot of traffic they're just they're just looking up there and go I need to get over now because all these people are online for the left-hand turn you know plus you'd have the blinking yellow light and if there's no traffic in front of you coming across from the south to the north you just go and you still have a life for the higher flow yeah and you don't think that traffic is going to back up so bad in that turn lane that they can't get out of 12th or 13th no matter what well I think there may be times but but I think that's there now yeah I I think I think that eliminated it by doing what they did but you you take however many cars are stacked up right now and you double the length is what you're doing so um but it's not much it's I've seen it you know both ways I think that one of the arguments that and trust me I I'd like to see that thing go too but I don't live there um uh one of the arguments was that that that Island uh presents a buffer it it guarantees there's a lane that you can hop into at least now you're there so you can merge over and then get into the the traffic flow whereas if you extend that further down and traffic's backed up you have nothing the only thing you can do is make a right and find a place to make a U-turn yeah and that was the complaint um also uh would you leave the existing crosswalk where it is yes okay so you just tear the island and the trees out right just like Sixth Street yeah yeah because they definitely don't want to lose their crosswalk no no no no yeah did not recommend that at all you could probably you could probably put bleachers on that corner and sell tickets this time of year because I've chased I've chased cars down that actually hit people and taken off on the two things going over the bridge we chased them and uh we got them in Bel Air they especially with the trailers okay because when they make the turn like you said no one's giving you any leave all right and it's it's comical or downright insane some of the ever since they wired that right but um I don't know I think going back to the whole system was better because you know one lane and just turned but yeah when I when I first got on Council I asked how do you people North get the hell out of your neighborhood and you said sideways you know yeah I said you know that's probably it but uh um I think it's I think if you remove that I'm kind of in agreement with the mayor that now you've got two lanes that are jammed up this time of year now they're all trying to make the left-hand turn oh they're two lanes well if you're going to expand that lane you're going to take the medium out right and expand the left lane but you're still going to have another Lane too no no no no oh yeah it would go back to being a double straight through so so so instead of three lanes you'll just have two lanes one going into Indian Rocks no no there'll still be the same Lanes the bi-directional is the one everybody will get into to make the left-hand turn so you just have one left-hand terminal that's correct okay right but that I'm sorry what happens is as you're crossing the existing islands and and all of that structure there that would be an extension of the turn lane to allow cars to pile up and that would pile up and it would is what I'm I just want to caution you because I'm open to trying anything sure yeah there's there's going to be some unhappy people well here's what's going on I mean that's just it is what it is that's a at times of vocal Street if they're not happy and so uh I just want to caution you that um that it could happen and hey if they say we can change it and and the county doesn't mind re-striping their own Street 10 times until we figure it out I think it's worth trying yeah and they said that of course they could you know they would set the queue deeper based on the time of the year you know so they could have that left-hand turn green for a minute and a half if they know it's like spring break time you know so that thing you know when it turns red it may not take long to back up but then as soon as it turns green it's going to flush I wish it would stay in the rain for an hour in the morning create another brains going and then not far below the causeway the one on the right has to merge into the one right you're into one but it's longer yeah it's it's pretty decent yeah you know in my eight years here it never really was a problem south of the causeway but now we're getting traffic and she can attest to this oh all the way into First Street backed up on the weekends to make the right-hand turns like you said the right hand turn yeah oh yes 20 I think 25 minutes to and this was not at lunch time this was about 10 30 to get from the south end of Indian Rocks Beach just to the uh past the intersection and mayor I think a lot of people now are using that other bridge to get into Indian Rocks and they're going straight into it it's a mess inside streets well that's something you should also uh when it when they're updating the study they can look at you know even new issues so if that's I don't know if it's a new issue coming from the uh South to the north and they can look at that and and perhaps change the light cycles on it has those numbers the numbers from that study yeah you take the pen Alice going look at the amount of flow that's coming through here on a weekend oh they know okay that's who they report to is this online uh this was given to me by Lynn because I was asking for it just obviously before he left I should be able to find anything so then I asked the next question how was the final decision made so I don't know if anybody here Colin or what your participation was he said well the final thing after the study was done he said it was actually the whole thing started um with the previous mayor I said you mean Dave he said no no the other guns so um and and so he met with the city manager and the study was done which was great because there was a bigger problem just like you mentioned with the people coming from Clearwater or Largo whatever and coming over here to get to the beach or to get to Clearwater and so the bridge was backing up has that improved any it seems like we've had residents get up on the floor saying I made a mistake I went to Home Depot Saturday 11 o'clock and I yanked it back until two o'clock yeah I I have pictures and I believe yeah my phone of just how bad it is and and it's there's no Rhyme or Reason to it because all of a sudden everybody just decides let's go to the beach yeah well he said that he said that that's um if they had that new information or information again they'll change the light cycles so that ideally whatever the volume of traffic coming in here is and they're all making that right hand turn they'll keep that arrow green for an extended period of time just to get everybody off the bridge they got another Bridge coming up so they got to change all the Cycles right you could put burp lights in there but then it's going to impact the residents when they leave here you know like you know make a nice long delay on that bridge and then clear up Gulf Boulevard but if you have to go to Publix or something like that yeah when I bought my house four years ago or we bought our house um the guy who owned it actually gave me an eight and a half by eleven and said these are the times you don't want to be going across the bridge okay nice yeah so it was great I thought he was kidding at first but he wasn't kidding okay yeah that's Gulf Boulevard it's the right turn back at you know yeah so it was all backed up I will I'll email these to Kyle and he can share them with everyone I don't know what the answer is except like what he said you're not going to live to see it I'm not going to live no uh they'd rather put a bus in um so anyway possible thank you step one to request some studies yeah well I I think if they're willing to do a study then the numbers are valuable I think right yeah so that we get to study and then um give them some direction of what we'd like to have and see if they they'll go for it yeah he said basically anything we asked them to do to do it I I still think it's probably not a bad idea just to do a once we get we start getting serious to just take a little survey down those two streets because they're the ones that are gonna They're Gonna Fill the end result more than anyone um that's it deal any other uh General business I have something I want to talk about just quickly happened today um well over the last couple days spieler is a doc Builder he's been building um a dock on our street I would I observed them offloading their truck on the bridge on Harrison Avenue they had the barge out there didn't say anything Let It Go probably should have but I should probably should have snapped the photo and just called code enforcement I didn't today they were floating pilings all through the intercoastal they just had them like laying out there we my husband went to lead with the boat and he had to work around these pilings oh wow I did call code enforcement about that they finally did bring them in tied them to the sea wall but this is weird these guys do whatever they want to in this city they've been warned a number of times about offloading the piles onto their barge on um Belle Isle on Harrison Avenue anywhere they can 22nd Street on the bridge itself they are the worst and the easiest way for them to get it because they don't want to come to the marina and unload them like everyone else does they don't they want um it requires more than just their standard barge with a with a boom on it that's not what that's for that's for driving the the pilings into the ground and or pulling them out okay but they need a separate one to keep all the pilings on it and that's the problem they don't want to do that can we remove them from uh being able to work here in the city no you can uh assuming you've got code that addresses it you can give them a code citation and you uh I presume because every city does has in your code enforcement a nuisance preference yeah and instruct us to file soup against them for creating a public nuisance that will cost them money and we'll drag them into court and hopefully and if you where are they offloading anywhere they want jurisdiction yeah oh yeah yeah so another thing you can do in addition to the nuisance is create code that says you're not allowed to offload there that any doc Builder must offload their pilings or whatever they're called here or here you know just call it out and then don't we already have that Kyle I thought we've already addressed this because it we have signs I have to check through the code okay itself yeah um but I don't think there is a designated place that we recommend we don't allow them to in the city so could we completely restrict it yeah probably I mean are your residents going to get mad that they're not going to be able to have a doc Built Well they can they just have to bring them in from the marina from the water yeah yeah and other companies do that yeah and they blow them and they float them next to the barge too that's okay as long as you're talking about yeah tied to the bars yeah but uh otherwise but to just float them out and then it was uh it's the canal that goes to our Marina they were floating and just tied off and it took a lot of effort to tie these tiles off in the middle of our Waterway there and I guess that's our jurisdiction it's not really the intercoastal so it wasn't you know we don't have a police boat we don't have a any sort of means to go out there and no no they knew that because they've seen Mike's pictures of Kyle rescuing the islands they knew they were safe yeah that's exactly what it was and those shorts and Sheriff's Department Yeah just something Food For Thought I don't know if next time you know when we need to make sure our code covers this but next time they pull a permit we probably should slap him on a hand I know there's nothing you can do more than give them a hey by the way we're going to keep an eye on you we want to know when you're in the city because you guys aren't following our code well and even if it's activities that are occurring in your jurisdictional Waters you have jurisdiction over those Waters so for instance you you can say no uh dock Builder is allowed to float their pilings or whatever unless they get a separate piling movement permit from us and then you have to coordinate it it's got to be only these times a day you've got to do these things things I mean it's more regulation but if you're having much notice well they are the ones who chopped the piling off and just let it float out in the canal and I think I called them and said hey come get this or maybe I maybe I called the city and we were able to grab it away yeah yeah they chopped the top of it and just let it go next time you're boating through there I'll see what those things do at speed yeah yeah it is a huge house they may be the ones who uh who drop the concrete uh Pier out there and right there in the uh right around the one yeah there's one it's still out there on everywhere but uh one of my neighbors his buddy brought a big triple engine boat out and they were going to go fishing and lost one of the lowers completely broken off um and they went and found it and they marked it and uh and left it there all right uh any action items on that one other than just uh raising awareness and and uh I think Kyle's going to look at investigated code and then uh discuss what legal how to best pursue it okay there's my one right there yes sir one other quick thing that I did talk to Tom about Kyle also asked him is there any new technology out there that could assist us with um alerting drivers on our crosswalks because we know we have the yellow flashing so he said two things have happened that they put in a couple places they have in front of the crosswalk with the flashing lights go on as soon as somebody hits the button like I don't know 30 feet in front each way there's an additional flashing device that kind of tells the driver hopefully hey hey you know there's something going on here then they see the second one and they stop in addition to that I think the app was called maze that was called wait my bad ways and he said they're working very closely with that so that when you hit the crosswalk button anybody that's within X distance and if they have it that weighs on it automatically comes up to have the radio on it'll tell them alert alert somebody's Crossing whatever it says people run through those things they they don't stop they don't work unless you walk out into the street and I I'll get back a few cars my wife and I were across the Sixth Street what the sheriff was in there and we put the light on six cars went through us and I'm standing in there yeah he's just he's nodding at me like and he went down flying out of him and got him off it was a good big payday for that day but they don't stop unless she actually walk out I swear yeah well I think the local residents do because they're familiar with it well yes they're talking about the Clearwater traffic yeah yeah Weekend Warriors now yeah sad I have one more question if I can what is the cost of a parking ticket that I've been meaning to bring that up when we're talking about rates the current costs of a parking ticket in Bellaire Beach is uh 35 and if you don't pay it in such a I think 30 days it goes to 70. but if we are raising our rates we need to raise our parking tickets because people are just gonna opt to get the parking ticket I would like to act well you're bringing that up I would like where it says no parking on the streets I would actually like to find posted on that time every one of them so that it's a fifty dollar 75 dollar fine if you park in the street we just went through this you should go a residents said the guy comes in parks at 12th Street resident says hey you have to have a sticker he goes what's the fine here like 30 40 he said 30 to 40 dollars cost of doing business and you know he said let him find me it's cheaper yeah and he he stayed there he got fine and lots of our sheriffs don't actually walk on the beach and ask anybody are you in this car or whatever like that and give him the opportunity to leave which I don't think is right I don't want him to do that yeah we just went through this in Redington Beach and the rates went up to 100 first offense 200 a second offense five hundred dollars third that's in Reddington yeah hey I'm all for it right now there's people they park at every bridge around here they go fishing and they you can even tell them hey just giving you a heads up if cop comes by you're gonna get a ticket I think that would also curb it to actually announce what the fine is so big much bigger fine and and we publicize what it is um I guess she's a reddington's wherever that was I have a more business but it's nine o'clock and I will postpone it until the next work session um anything else I just want to thank everyone for the flowers and being supportive during you know the lost my product just thank you guys that's it okay well um uh Mike uh your take has been a major distraction this entire meeting and I'm going to tell you right now you're forbidden to have another birthday cake for at least a year no problem all right pizza next time yeah all right uh do we have emotions all in favor of everybody get some rest nice being with you all tonight"
