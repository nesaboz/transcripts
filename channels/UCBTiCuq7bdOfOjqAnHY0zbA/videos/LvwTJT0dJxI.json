    "transcript": "all right so with that we're about to get started here um thank you all for making the time to be here I I know that it is um probably the most exciting night of your year so congratulations um for those of you who I haven't had the fortune of meeting or seeing sit painfully sit through a meeting my name is Randy Mora I am your City attorney here in Bellaire Beach I've been the City attorney uh since roughly late May early June of last year this is a joint meeting of a few of our boards and the public is welcome to attend as well to discuss public records in Sunshine Law and a little skosh of Ethics as well we're going to touch on these things because they materially affect you your life changed a little bit when you volunteered for Public Service as if that wasn't gift enough um you get the joy of an attorney telling you how your life has changed before I begin I'm not going to make you guys do the whole let's go around the room thing but just make show of hands is there anybody here who does not serve in on a public office is just here because you are a glutton for punishment and interested all right so thank you council member um so otherwise everybody is here because they were voluntold to be here thank you for that um with that I will try to keep this light I want to keep it light but I want to keep it informative that said as I suggested already you're all adults if you need to get up and use the restroom or get a drink do so if somebody calls please step out I ask that you do silence your phones um so that we don't have too many distractions that said this is only valuable if you get the information you came for uh we're going to go through public records and sunshine primarily I will touch on ethics without going through a slide deck you should all have notepads in front of you if you feel compelled to take notes or just draw Doodles of me whatever you want to do um that said um if you have questions comments or concerns as we go just put your hand in the air and I'll call on you I want to make sure you get the information you came for okay so with that we're going to get started I'm going to start the video here and we're going to go through public records first I know how excited you are I know public records it's no I'm not the clerk I'm not Patty I'm not Kyle why am I sitting through something on public records uh well I will tell you we're sitting we're talking about it because it is a very very critical part of Florida's government law I like to joke the Florida's public records law is like the origin story for the world's greatest comic book hero the world's greatest comic book hero is of course not Superman not Batman but Florida man Florida man as you see in the newspapers throws a throws an alligator into a drive-through Florida man goes with his stuff tells the officer that a stuffed animal was driving when he's pulled over for DUI the reason all your relatives and friends from college send you weird articles about Florida is because every time there's some random news story whether you're in Oregon Mexico or Florida you have the ability to ask for records about it if it's a slow news day just make a public records request in Florida you'll be fine they have crazies in New York in Texas and California too their laws aren't always as transparent and as easy to navigate as ours so as we talk about both the public records law and the Sunshine Law we're going to be talking about both a constitutional and a statutory Duty as a constitutional matter under Florida's Constitution every person has the right to inspect or copy any public record made or received in connection with official business let's break that down a little bit every person not every taxpayer not every resident not everybody who's never been in a short-term rental it's every person has the right to inspect or copy a public record any public record subject to a little asterisk we'll talk about in a little bit so you're a poor clerk Patty has and will get public records requests from a doctoral student in Spokane Washington an advocacy group based out of Philadelphia which we saw in the just in the last week here in this community every person has that right in the Florida of yesteryear as emails became a newer thing there were some media organizations who would maintain a terminal in City Hall and come once a week and read all the officials emails just to see what they were going to write about now they can just ask for a production of those but the fact Still Remains I can tell you as I transitioned from being a private sector attorney to doing this roughly 10 years ago I was surprised that when I wrote a memo to my client the city commission two days later it was in the paper not every word of it I'm not that important but you get the idea um that's a public record if I write a memo tomorrow to the city Commission on something that is not exempt which is almost everything uh that memo is a is a public record available for inspection and that's a constitutional right in the State of Florida and that's repeated in chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes that it is the policy of the state that all Municipal records are open for personal inspection and copying that's our policy here in the State of Florida what I will tell you is from a practical standpoint what this means and the reason all of you are here I'll touch on it will bookend we'll do the whole military thing I'm going to tell you what I told you I'll tell you and then I'll tell you I told you so we'll start out by here's what I'm going to tell you as a practical matter the public records Duty we have under our constitution is a service this city provides and you are all a part of that service even if you didn't know it yet you'll know it as you leave here today but that is a duty that we all carry and if we look at that as a service we provide akin to keeping the lights on and the streets clear if you change your perception which I know some of you didn't have any perception of it but for most public records are often public records requests are often perceived as the first Salvo in a battle they've asked for records I wonder what this is about they're coming at us there's going to be a lawsuit or they're going to make a scene at next week's meeting doesn't matter what they're going to do they have a right to the record so why don't we stop being concerned with the motivations do the job right and narrow what legal claims they have because in addition to whatever legal claim they might be pursuing we don't want to add a public records violation to that count so that's why you're all a part of this and I will tell you that there have been occasions where less Orthodox officials like yourselves get tested on the public records law because you're not as likely to know and so this city like many other cities has thought it best to make sure everybody knows so that you're not held to some impossible standard that you were never aware of so that's why you get the joy of being here tonight so thank you so we talked about that it's a public record and there's a statutory Duty that is an unconditional right it is an unconditional right which means we can't make conditions on public records requests you cannot require that somebody provide their identity to get a record yes you can make an anonymous records request you cannot require a flat fee there's no cover charge it's not a club in South Beach if you have a request yes we can charge for the actual costs of the request but we can't say it's fifty dollars before we even look at what you said before you ask for you can't require that there only be a single medium oh if you're going to make a public records request it has to be on form 420 and submit it on a Tuesday no I'm calling you and telling you I want this record please get it for me and you can't you certainly cannot require as a fun as a condition that they just tell you their motive why you want this why do you even need this what's your angle here just ask me just be a man tell me I've seen that play out that Dynamic play out um that's not how this should go [Music] so what we've established why we're talking about this but what is a public record answer a public record is all documents regardless of their physical form Mater received pursuant to law or ordinance in connection with the transaction of official business fancy way of saying any document any item that memorializes this City's business is a public record so sir what board are you on okay so you're on the board of adjustments sir and you work on variances and you're looking at the agenda let's say you write an email to Kyle and say Kyle I'm concerned about the application that we went over Tuesday night I cannot continue to serve if we are going to be done that email that you have sent Kyle is about the city's business and is most definitely a public record let's say you're a member of you're just John Q public who sat in the back of the room and you and I send an email to the board member and say I was really proud of the way you stood up for us residents Tuesday night and we need more people who are going to stand by and hold the line on our Heights and setbacks thank you for what you do that email is itself a public record if I ask if a request is received for all communication buying between members of the public and the board of adjustment in the last two weeks you have a responsive record and you will have a duty to produce it you can't say oh well that went to my Yahoo account that doesn't count oh well that was on my other phone I got two phones um you know full drug dealer status and that's on my other phone um that's not how the analysis works the analysis of what is and is not a public record is commanded entirely by the content of the record itself meaning I can't know if something is a public record until I look at it uh and do that analysis I'm presently litigating a case on behalf of a public official as to whether they're phone logs on their private cell phone are a public record or not um we if if I I joke that I'm I'm Dominican which means by extension I am a mama's boy I am a Dominican Prince to a very lovely older Dominican woman and if I avoided my mom's calls for two weeks we go we talk pretty much every day if I avoided my mom's calls for two weeks you could better believe she will look up and find out if I have a Belair Beach email address an email City Attorney at bellarbeach.gov Randall call your mother that is not a public record even though it is on a Bellaire Beach server it's not a public record no if she wrote Randall I saw that your city is talking about putting pickleball courts in we have those in our community you should look at what we're doing about it that's a public record even though she's my mother she's contacting me more in the capacity as a constituent here's information this city should use in its deliberative process so when you look at whether something is a public record or not it doesn't matter if it's electronic it doesn't matter if it's a Facebook message a Facebook comment a tweet a Reddit thread a DM a Snapchat I'm going to start using words some of you might not know nfts doesn't matter the medium is not the issue it's its content that defines whether or not it's a public record a very quick story that hopefully none of you will ever find yourself in I represented a public official who received a public records request for all public records in their text messages for the last year well what does that mean that means I or somebody I had to read every text message this man sent to received for a year to determine if it was a public record oh well why didn't you just look at whatever it's a Kyle and Patty well if he texts Kyle and says hey are you going to poker tonight not a public record but if he says I can't make it to the meeting do you have a copy of the agenda I'd like to appear via Zoom public record and so you're having to look at every single message in that thread and consider that and I tell you that just to start sensitizing you to the ways that the public records law reaches our public officials very rarely does this extend to our subordinate boards I'm not trying to scare you I recognize it can be scary especially if this is the first time you're ever hearing this however it is a reality we must be aware of because the way the courts look at what a public record is is it's anything that perpetuates communicates or formalizes knowledge of some type of the city so this is from a supreme court opinion in Florida dating back to 1980. this is a well established Doctrine perpetuate communicate formalize that's your public records test and so and it's supposed to be construed liberally in favor of openness which is to say and you'll see this with the Sunshine Law as well if you think you found a way around the public records law I'd like to commend you because you may have found a new way to violate the public records law um we will go into what that means but generally speaking if you when in doubt we generally produce unless there's really good legal Doctrine or the absence of sufficient legal Doctrine to allow us to to colorly argue that that record is not a public record sir yes thank you it's the first bullet up there in red any material prepared in connection with official agency business which is intended to perpetuate communicate or formalize knowledge of some type and I'll give you an example so while you take a moment to look at some of those uh con those uh judicial quotes uh in one of in a city we represent a few years back there was a an incident with somebody who was unfortunately mentally ill in the downtown area making lewd comments to passers-by and threatening them with the silver object saying he was going to assault them um police responded to the scene they continued that pattern of behavior and ultimately they were shot and killed uh there was an investigation after the fact all once the investigation closed and everything was done the police report said that the the the suspect possessed a silver sharp object resembling a knife and was lunging at somebody to stab them when they were shot so once all that was done after the fact we received when the investigations are closed we receive a public records request to inspect because remember it's inspector copy to inspect the silver sharp object referenced in the police report which of course is going to be an Evidence and so that was the question is it a public record well it formalizes the officer's knowledge of the of the events on scene it certainly meets that definition perpetuates the rationale for his action so we made a public records production they came into a room that was roughly the size of this Podium held up a little baggie took a picture with their phone and went on their way and that was a public records request fulfilled so that's how it's not just text messages documents and memoranda it's anything that perpetuates communicates or formalizes knowledge of some type oh we fixed the pipe because it was broken and cracked we have photos of that those photos are public records anything that documents our knowledge any questions on that so far all right one question that often comes up from our board members what about rough drafts if I just you know I I'm I don't get a chance to talk until the end of the meeting I'm taking notes and I want to make sure that when I talk I'm prepared I've made notes are those a public record I'm going to give you that wonderful lawyer answer well it depends it depends um there's two things there if your Note is just if your notes are really just notes don't forget to say that the beach cleanup is Tuesday and have a safe Fourth of July and it's hurricane season be prepared probably not a public record you're just kind of gathering your thoughts but let's say we're regulating sea turtles and you say and you've done some fact finding well the Boston C aquarium says this and in Monterey This Is How They regulate it and now you're doing fact-finding you have data well that is much more a public record than just collecting your thoughts so you don't mess up um so you'll see a division of opinion on on drafts on notes drafts are public records drafts are definitely public records if I send if Kyle says Randy we need a new contract for the City Attorney Services and I send him a draft and he says no no I wanted three years not five years the money's too high change this change that and then I and he sends me back a draft and I send him a draft all of them sorry all of those versions are public records not just the final product the same is true of minutes of your meeting you can't say oh well we don't have minutes because we haven't approved them yet if there is a draft of your minutes there's that's a public record the audio recording of your meeting public record any questions on that sir well so you don't need to save every iteration of a document um so the question there's a difference in the question you have there is is it a public record versus how long do I keep it the how long do I keep it is a very easy analysis the division of information and Library Services has a 95-page PDF that breaks down how every form of record should be preserved based on its content um that is to say it's and it depends that depends on the content of it but generally speaking transitory records only need to be kept for as long as their administrative value if I call you today and say Hey Lloyd it's Randy call me while that voicemail may be a public record maybe because all I said is call me who knows what it's about but if I say Hey Lloyd call me it's about that short-term rental issue by the time he learns of the message and listens to it that's that's its value he can delete it he doesn't have to keep it forever so that there's sort of a division there I'm not telling you that every single thing you write down has to be kept forever if you have a concern about it I would work with Patty on what are the protocols here I'm not going to be able to answer every question in that regard but generally speaking if you've if you've prepared a speech and you say here's the speech I was reading off of it you may wish to surrender that just to avoid the issue later um sir so the question asked was and sorry I meant to redo restate all the questions the question asked was what if you have a document on your computer and you delete it can they seize your computer and try to restore the file what I would tell you is if you're deleting the file to avoid the public records law that's a bigger issue um you know you can't go full Enron um however if you had the question is going to become did you have the file now if you sent let's say you drafted a proposed agenda and then you sent it to Patty or you sent it to Kyle or you sent it to somebody within the city the fact that it now exists on a city server you can delete you have a copy of the document when it's asked for so that's one way that I will tell you your best bet as we talk about it is get things off out of your possession and in the possession of the people who are principally responsible for these things and you you minimize the issues in that regard sir it can be a public record it depends on what you're writing but if it's just as simple as I don't agree with this what about this question lacking facts some something so you're prepared for the meeting it is a public record however you don't need to keep that forever it has its value until you get to the meeting now you've relayed your thoughts into the microphone you don't need to keep that that's probably not it may not be a public record to the extent it is or could be construed as such it's retention values for your use at the meeting you used it at the meeting you're done again if you used it as a place where you started taking down notes about facts and fact-finding I've researched this what they do in Montana California the sheriff says this there's a Judicial opinion that says that you may wish to keep that longer because that's a little bit more factual You may wish to Just Surrender and say hey Patty here's the notes I took in some communities I will tell you there's a difference of opinion on drafts and notes I'm not going to well not drafts but generally notes and again and I've talked to the people whose job it is in the archiving office their analysis generally goes to if it's just stuff for you to collect your thoughts probably not when you start getting into real research is when you start creating a record that may warrant longer preservation about it I'm not there's nothing in the law that requires you to to take notes to document everything um but this is that is how some people operate as a result um I generate volumes of content on a daily basis Kyle and I talk quite literally at least twice a day during the week we talked twice a day and in between and maybe a text message hey I missed you an email hey did you see this those emails and text messages are usually public records usually if I text them and say hey how did your kid do at Little League not a public record um so you know there's there's sort of that division but I I will tell you that the takeaway will be from this it may not be the not not don't write everything down but for some I'm sure you've heard that cliched phrase of seeing like no one can hear you dance like no one's watching and write every email and text message as though it will be read aloud at deposition or printed in the paper if any of you communicate with me in writing I think Ron's seen a little bit of this Mr signex seen a little bit of this Kyle's certainly seen this the way I I'm talking right now is a lot more colloquial a lot faster um my emails are highly formalistic because I know that that potential exists and making jokes and things don't come through later people if I write like oh I could just kill him for doing this and later it's like oh so you threatened to kill a public official like no no man like but that you're never going to make that defense so right as those not it that the audience is someone other than the one person you're sending it to because later on some 20-something lawyer is going to be reading it and making a case of it for something um or some citizen activist or otherwise so be mindful of that so we've talked about the why and the what so let's get to the who who's responsible for all this on some level obviously you otherwise we wouldn't be wasting your time the really comes down to that whole idea that the nine tenths of the law is possession who has the record for some of you especially our council members when you're elected to public office you receive an email address you know Randy Mora at bellairbeach.gov that's not some Fringe benefit I there is no fringe benefit the best day of public service is when you're elected or appointed it's downhill from there there's no benefits you get more headaches you got to spend a Wednesday night listening to some devilishly handsome lawyer talk at you you know that that's there's no real upside beyond the one fuzzy feeling in your heart right so the reason you get that email address is because the city can now index and search those files when they get a public records request a reminder somebody else is reading your emails or at least has the capacity to so if that's a concern for you fine you can do your business elsewhere that doesn't change that it's a public record it changes whose job it is to produce it if Patty has it it's Patty's job she's the custodian of Records here as a matter of Statute in this in the city but if it's just your Facebook account Randy Moore at commissioner you know commissioner Randy Moore on Facebook and I'm the only person with the username and password and I've got the list of who is banned and the content and the posts then I'm the custodian and now that's my job so if you do City business hey I see that you've applied for a variance in the city I'm on the board which please don't do that anyways but like if you're sending a message to an applicant that's a public record even if it's on your your phone it's a text message only you have then you have the responsibility because the custodian of records every person who has custody of a public record shall not could not maybe shall permit the record to be inspected or copied at a reasonable time under reasonable conditions and I'll get to your question just a second what that doesn't mean is when you leave here tonight and you go to Publix because you forgot to cook and you got to get the rotisserie chicken that somebody could say like hey weren't you at that meeting about public records I'd like to inspect your phone no that's not a reasonable time the chicken's only going to be hot a little while that's not how that works they you have you should definitely acknowledge that they're asking for the record and if the and you will produce it at a reasonable time but right now I'm trying to have dinner before nine good night um please give me your contact information how would you like me to follow up with you but now is not that moment you are not hostage everywhere you go to this law that way uh sir would it be smart so the question was if I'm communicating with accounts if I'm on a subordinate board and I'm commuting and communicating with a council member with Kyle would it be wise to copy the city clerk short answer yes sending it to Kyle or a council member is probably fine enough because it's already on the city server at that point um just as a function of how this city operates but it can't hurt because it's just an acknowledgment uh it's a it's a tacit of knowledgement of what's already true Patty's going to have the responsibility for indexing this and accessing it at a later date you've made it a little easier because maybe it'll sound familiar to her um but that is yes that is a practice some do certainly I will tell you listen all of you are in this because you're half decent people I presume I want to I usually start by doing something I forgot to do thank you I've said this to my commission recently and I mean it thank you none of this works if you people don't do this you are volunteering your time and that is not lost on me as cynical as I am as an attorney I have a small little Grinch heart in there that really believes in what we do here and that altruism doesn't feed on people saying I'm doing it for my ego it's on people like you volunteering your time and recognizing that if your community is going to continue to look the way you want it to and do the things that you value you need to be a part of that process and Steward it so thank you and with that comes this added burden and I'm sorry for that but it's true so here we are and so with that yes if you are doing business on your Yahoo and Gmail accounts you're here the part of that thank you was you're here because you're Community leaders you were you know presidents of Banks and volunteer community leaders former School teachers ex-military former cops whatever it was that brought you here and now you're in this community and you're part of The Bella Beach Community Foundation or the rotary people know you they know how to reach you already they don't you don't you may become slightly more accessible but they already have an established way of communicating with you so if somebody reaches you on your Gmail account or your business account because that's how they find you ordinarily but they want to now talk to you about City business Hey Ron I want you to know that the CAC is is going to have a measure coming up on finance and I think they need to consider this sent to your personal Yahoo account what I recommend my public officials do is if you have a city account and I don't know if all our boards do but if you have a city account forward the email there and respond from there or reply from your account and copy that City account or the clerk and say thank you for your email if you have a separate account let them know hey I'm council member Roberts if you wish to reach me about City business please on a going forward basis email me here it just makes it easier for us to keep track of these things and ensure that you're not falling between the cracks so you show that you're doing this for them right I'm I want to make sure your needs get met not do it because it makes my life easier um and say and I've copied the clerk here going forward please reach me here or please you know or you just blind copy the clerk and don't make it a thing and then that way you know it got onto a city server that's how I suggest people handle that it's forwarding those messages on yes sir so yes sir um the question was asked if I serve on a board and somebody for example the board of adjustment and I receive an email from my neighbor that says hey I'm trying to build a shed my property's a little weird and I I got to put it maybe two feet closer than I really want to but I and and the code I think says I can't how do I go about that is that a public record it most certainly is even if it's your neighbor even if it's your old college roommate The Godfather of your children does not matter they're contacting you about City business and especially if you reply and say please see section 2-348 of the city code please don't give legal advice by the way um uh but if you said like well there's a whole code on variances you can find it on municode and if you have questions about forms our city managers Kyle riesler here's his email address let's say you reply that way that's definitely a public record and since it especially if you're going to start saying here's who you should contact just copy those people and now back on the city server hashtag not your problem all right so some of the questions to ask yourself yes sir [Music] foreign so the question was asked maybe your resident starts talking to you maybe they know you're on a board maybe they don't but in the course of the conversation it's revealed that you're a member of the board hey I'm on the parks and rec board I'm talking I'm just out here playing a pickleball match and somebody says yeah you never notice how court three always got that divides about and you're like well actually I'm on the board and no the question was do I have to record that event no you do not you do not have to record that event there is no affirmative obligation to create records in fact and I was I'm going to get to this in a moment when somebody makes a public records request in the State of Florida we only produce the records we have we do not have to record we do not have to create records it is not some people hear a few buzzwords and they get them caught in their head oh for you Freedom of Information Act I want this information good but if we don't have a record about it we don't have to make the record so periodically our city might receive a request for something I'm going to make it a little absurd but for something like let's say we maintain our own Police Department I want I would like you to fill in the following chart it's going to have in one column the officer's name their badge number their date of higher their rank their favorite color and who their first kiss was with and our response to that is going to be we don't have any records meeting this description no responsive records produced now of course we have records of who our officers are and of course we know they're badge numbers in their ranks and we could say we have this org chart we have this payroll sheet but as far as what their favorite movie is their favorite color who their first kiss was when they first went to Disney we don't index that information now if we did it's part of our hiring documents then we produce those records but we won't we will not say we do not have a chart that looks like that we don't have to produce that any more than you have to go home and start going full Doogie Howser today I met somebody um and you know creating a record you don't have to do that there's no dear diary obligation here okay so the question becomes how do I know if I'm the custodian of the record how do I know if I'm assuming this responsibility well there's some questions you can ask yourself are you the only person with custody of it are you able to transfer that record to the clerk or somebody else designated for it to be responsible for it are you using government-issued devices not dispositive but it's helpful to know if it's a government-issued device less likely that you're the only person to access to its data does the government have access to login credentials who's ensuring preservation how do you handle a dynamic record a dynamic record Dynamic versus static is a record that changes and this is my word of caution to you on social media I recognize it as a very low cost and effective way to reach a large group of people social media is that the record does not stay the same the classic example I give is under the last presidential Administration one of the cast of characters was a gentleman named Anthony scaramucci he was a press secretary when scaramucci was hired most people didn't know who he was was who was this guy so they do a deep dive in his social media history and he has a tweet from like 2011 that says something like you miss 100 of the shots you don't take attributed to Albert Einstein that wasn't it but something like that some cliched phrase unironically attributed to definitely the wrong person and once he was hired in this position that tweet eight years later or rather like six years later became one of the most retweeted tweets of all time most subtweeted with comments and all these things so let's say in 2012 a year after he makes the Tweet he prints out a copy of it and says I have the public record in case somebody asks let's say he was a city official she's got the record but six years later when there's all these comments about it he no longer has a full accounting of the record the record can change so be mindful of that if you have a record that has the capacity to and in fact does change that that responsibility May complicate that because if someone asked later for I'd like all the comments made in the last two years oh well I printed it three years ago you hopefully still have access to that record right so something else to consider there with social media we talked about records retention a public record is not required to be eternally preserved I jumped a little bit there is a guide for how long a record is preserved it depends on the contents of the record you're going to look to that guy long story short for you folks don't make that call yourself if you're in a position of having to decide that or or or research it turn to your custodial records turn to your City attorney and we will help you navigate that if that really is an issue what you do have an obligation to do and the reason that I make sure that you folks we in part make sure you folks sit through this is understanding that a custodian of public records and his or her designee must must promptly acknowledge a public records request and respond to the request in good faith in a reasonable time blah blah blah but there's a little bit of like second grade conflict resolution young adult therapy involved if I come up to you and I'm asking I'm saying hey I'd like to see that record I don't get to say pound sand I have to say not in these words please don't use these words this is very lawyerly but I hear that you're making a public records request for all maintenance records for the bricks installed by bbcf and paid for by the city the city is prepared to produce those records in a timely fashion how would you like those produced that's what it sounds like when Patty does it there's some version of that she's got a script there may be charges associated with this any down payments will be returned if they're not expended blah blah blah blah but for people out there in the field your job is to have your antenna up and know when someone's asking for something if you're at the end of the variance hearing and you're trying to make your way to go buy that rotisserie chicken at Publix and somebody who's been sitting in the back of the room says you know I didn't know you guys did this I find this really interesting if I wanted to know which variances you granted in the last year how would I get that hmm Loosely resembles a public records request they're not necessarily asking it there's a little bit of a hypothetical there but you know that that sounds like a public records request you can say if you wanted that information you can get it if you're asking for that I suggest you contact the city clerk tomorrow she can be reach right here you can walk right in here tomorrow you've acknowledged that they've asked for it you've affirmed that they can get it and you've shown them how to do it that's really the takeaway of this presentation for you folks well we want you to learn by sitting here is that you are all part of this team team Beller Beach and team Beller Beach knows it has a constitutional and statutory duty to fulfill public records requests and you're part of that I'll give you an example of a somewhat absurd example of that I was sitting at a meeting in another Beach Community as their City attorney it was sort of a work session on Beach renourishment and Beach preservation not a controversial issue at all um and during that meeting they brought every three and four letter agency in the State of Florida talk about what you could and could not do in sand dunes you can't plant this you can plant that you can't remove anything and one of the things that one of those agencies said was if you're going to remove Sea Oats you need a permit to do so or some other form of vegetation or if you're going to plant them you need a permit to do so I was drawing Doodles at the time I don't know but you need a permit to do some kind of activity involving vegetation in the sand dunes so later on once they're all done making their presentation somebody comes up in public comments is our city has periodically planted or removed vegetation from them several times over the last 10 years and I bet you they don't have any permits I bet you if we look for them this city wouldn't even know how to find those permits and I went full Kanye West and interrupted him and said sir I'm going to let you finish your public comment but it sounds like you're making a public records request of my board and this city takes that responsibility very seriously so you can conclude your statement but when you're done I'm going to meet you on the side so I can make sure I have a full understanding of your public records request and we'll fulfill it now of course once I get to the side he expresses great surprise at having met an attorney who doesn't know what a rhetorical question is but I will tell you that had I ignored that statement the very next meeting would be I asked I set it into a microphone check the audio check the minutes I made a public records request in this city not only do they probably not have the record they didn't even follow up which is a duty they definitely should know about forget the permits so I asked before you got in country and I got nothing what else is our city hiding from us that would have been the very next meeting so you acknowledge I don't like to talk in a meeting that way contrary to what you might have seen in some videos um but that's what that's the job we have to acknowledge we have to make sure we're facilitating that process any questions on that so far all right so I'm not expecting you to be able to read all that um the the point there is that everything that we do that perpetuates communicates and formalizes is a public record there are limited exceptions some things are confidential some things are exempt yes there is a difference the phone number excuse me the home address of a sitting judge not it's exempt from public record it's confidential information actually it's confidential their home address so if you were to produce their personnel record their personnel record is a public record their home address redacted but what we don't do is we don't say oh you can't have their personnel record there's confidential information in there no we identify the confidential information we redact it and then we have to say based on what statutory provision we're relying for that exemption or confidentiality we don't get to say I'd like to give it to you but it feels kind of icky um or that doesn't really seem polite to ask how much people make we have a budget it's public if you want to know you can know it may not be polite but it is still the law uh so when there are public records requests and we're concerned about confidential or exempt information do not make that call yourself if you're in the position of have being asked to help us with a public records request don't produce seven of the eight records and decide number eight is with is withheld because you say so that's a good way to violate the public records records law is what we call a strict liability law it doesn't matter what your motives or your intentions were you either did it right or you didn't end of analysis if you were supposed to produce 12 text messages and you gave us 11 public records violation right there so when we talk about the public records law let us meet your City attorney your city manager and your city clerk navigate that and decide thank you for giving it to us we're not going to give them this one but don't decide that for yourself when and and I know what some of you are thinking we've been talking about chapter 119 so I'm sure if we're talking about confidentiality and exempt stuff Randy I could just go look at like 119007 that's where the top secret stuff will be no your your laws are written by lawyers lawyers like job security so in order to find all of these exemptions there's like an Easter egg hunt throughout Florida Statutes um I've not completed the scavenger hunt yet I've tried every time I get a request I find a new one um last year maybe two years ago I was asked to produce the payroll records for a police department and I had this Excel spreadsheet with pivot tables and everything and there was one column that had deferred compensation I went column by column and searched and I learned that day that column JJ had confidential information in it I just had to search is there anything about this is there anything about that I had no reason to know that but deferred compensation contributions by law enforcement exempt from the public records and I have to cite the satch story and say and now on that basis I black out that column and I say pursuantas119 dot whatever it was we're not producing that column you have everything else so don't make those calls yourself um I I worked with one city many years ago where we were producing records and a clerk was like oh I know we don't produce people's salaries because like I was taught that when we started working here it's like okay can you show me where they got that from oh well Cindy said so okay we go talk to Cindy oh well Donna said so and it's like lore passed down through the ages with no substantiation so if someone's telling you that something's confidential or exempt play the cynic a little bit and ask where are we getting that from or can you have the City attorney show me what the how and why of that so we're good questions on confidentiality and exempt stuff I will tell you there's not a lot of joy in being a municipal lawyer these days but getting to tell people no every now and again just feels right um you get nothing you lose good days there's one of my favorite scenes in film and so I'm just saying don't be the person don't be Gene Wilder let me be Gene Wilder just for a moment at least um a little bit of levity but it does stand that you should let the people who do this for a living weigh in on the issue uh we can charge for public records are usually our commissioners and council members are more concerned about this well what if they're asking for our clerk to work a whole day on this what can we do about that she's got other stuff to do he's got other stuff to do we can charge for the extensive use of Information Technology or Personnel Services just this week I made a public records request of the city of Saint Augustine because I went there on a field trip with my son and I noticed they have a public marina and we've been talking about our public Marine on Doc slips and so I said public records requests for your policies administrative guidance and resolutions on wait lists and and priority for your boat slips and I and I got the full thread back they sent me their ordinance the Harbor Master sent me an answer he didn't have to do that but he did um and when I say he didn't have to he did an information response not a record response but I saw in sending that to the Harbor Master the clerk or whoever was responsible for that said please let me know if you have any records response responsive to this and if it's going to take you more than 15 minutes to investigate gather and produce these records please provide me an estimate of your time so that we can charge appropriately um it did not apparently take him all that long to send what he sent me but just know that we can charge for those things do charges have to relate directly to the to the efforts exhausted meaning if Lloyd makes a request and we don't have a he that makes a request for all building permits for one two three Gulf Boulevard for the last 20 years bear of a request we can do it we have to do it the absurdity of a request by the way does not dictate what we do we still have to do it so we go through the 20 years of Permitting records we get it together cost us 300 and we give it to him and Mike says sorry Mike says I heard council member Roberts made a public records request I'd want to see what he got please don't do that guys but like um let's say you did remember John Q public says I heard council member Roberts made a public records request I want a copy of that production well if we still have a cop we made us we should have made ourselves a copy of it so we know what went out and so when somebody asks for it if all we have to do is click Send on a PDF or put it on the top of its of a copier and press start it's no longer 300 it might be 30 for the pages you know and so that's that that informs the analysis and it has to directly relate um when when charging for records requests we generally advise our cities to get the costs up front um if it's going to cost thirty dollars ask if we think it's going to cost thirty dollars try and get thirty dollars up front or at least a good faith down payment give me 15 and we'll get started you don't want to be in the position of sending your constituents to collections because they didn't pay the 30 and but you really need it because you're supposed they were supposed to pay it you told them usually you want to pay before get the payment before you release the record there are penalties for violations of the public records law I deliberately put these at the end because truly thematically I don't want you doing it because you might get in trouble do it because we're supposed to because it's the right thing to do because it's a service we provide but you can get in trouble um with the public records law with any criminal law or civil violation typically you have what we call a men's Raya and an actus Reyes if you go back to law school mens rea is what were you thinking the access race is what did you do it's the difference between for most of us manslaughter first degree did you plan it or was it an accident well that's a different violation right so in the same vein I told you it doesn't matter a violation is a violation and that's true if you just commit a violation you're a subject excuse me to a non-criminal infraction punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars but if you knowingly do it yeah I I knew that it was a public record but I burned it in front of them okay different violation willfully unknowingly uh you went you went a little deeper um different violation and so the penalties increased but the Baseline penalty is if you were supposed to have and you didn't it's up to a fine up to 500. here's the why we told you why you're here again I've told you it's a service a responsibility and you're all part of Team Belair Beach well about see it's 2023 now about seven or eight years ago there was a bit of a trend in public records law where people would make burdensome requests or make requests of people who were less sophisticated on the issue in the city and trap them basically trap you in a public records violation let's say a city operates a Municipal Marina and during the summer you get a few teenagers or 20-somethings to swab the decks and keep things polished well what they would do is go out during the summer with a camera here here or maybe on a tie or something or on a hat and go up to the 17 year old and say hey this is a publicly operated Marina right yeah I'd like to see the slip agreement for slip 19. I'm sorry what you know take the airpod out what I'd like to see the slip agreement I'm sorry who are you I'm do you need to know who I am for me to get this that'd be helpful and they would walk them through every violation who are you why do you need this yeah what do you mean are you saying you need me to write it down well I've got a mop in a bucket yeah write it down man and they would get through all of those and then they would leave then they would send that video to your city manager or your City attorney and says looks like your folks don't know how the public records law works and we're going to sue you for this violation of the public records law and you have and when you lose because this is basically a civil rights law you're going to have to pay your lawyer and my lawyer in addition to releasing the record so how do you want to play this uh four thousand dollars will settle right now or you could fight it and lose 10 or 12 or whatever else so a lot of cities pivoted to doing this we'll spend the money to train our people this is on retainer nobody get alarmed um but we'll spend the money to train our people rather than have to pay their lawyers but that's what would happen in a county like Pinellas County there's 26 cities let's say 50 you can hit 12 in a day easily especially if you just go down Gulf Boulevard 50 of those mess up six six cities six times three to four thousand dollars it was worth it to do this Civic activism and I tell you I I'm I know I've said it a few times I'm a lawyer I've got smaller kids Middle School age almost kids and when they ask what Dad does I just tell them Daddy's a Storyteller that's all I am I'm a Storyteller and if I can make my story along with a rule book even better that's when Daddy wins so there's competing narratives here right if they're not while it is a villainous way of doing it I think it's not totally villainous right because the one narrative is it's in our constitution it's in our statutes it's in their Charter that they are supposed to be transparent and accountable to us and make records available to us and if every employee doesn't know that then they can't do it then they're not fulfilling their obligations to us as Citizens now how you go about making that point is a whole different analysis but that's the argument and our competing argument is we're a small City cash strap resource strap we're doing the best we can in service to our residents if you just would have come and talked to Patty on Tuesday she would have helped you we weren't trying to deny it we shouldn't have to pay for that so we train the other thing that happened as a result of that is you can see here requests often tested the nuances of the law in one Beach Community Gulfstream other coast 900 people as a resident Municipal staff of four in a year they received more public records requests than the alcohol the Bureau of about Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and the people were making the requests and then by the time you produced them they weren't picking them up they were already moved on to two or three it was just testing it was really there was a little bit of a vindictive thing going on there but that's how it goes record records case cost Lakeland 160 Grand that wasn't the penalty that wasn't like and we're finding you 160 Grand that's what it cost them to pay their lawyer and the other side's lawyer as they litigated the issue and it involved a flat a flat fee on public records requests which you can't do [Music] so the way the law changed is if you have a certain notice published which we have prominently published that says the office of the city clerk is the city's custodian of public records were all official records of the city are are routinely created received and retained and any request should be directed to the custodian at address phone number email if you have these things posted on your website in your city hall they have to give you five days notice before they sue you basically okay so you asked the teenage kid on the street but we made it very clear how to find us so before you sue me you gotta find me and give me a chance to fix it so what's happened is pardon me for a moment what a lot of cities have done and your city has this too is created business cards I joke with my officials and my employees these are this is the only get out of jail free card you'll probably ever actually get and what it is on for this one it's a different city but on one side it says we are happy to produce the records please contact the city clerk's office we'll provide the records as soon as possible and on the other side it says public records request contacts it has their title their phone number their fax number their email address the website in person or by mail at City Hall with the address and the hours of operation it's basically I'm not your guy I'm not your gal but this is how you find them so that when Public Works worker number three Public Works Tech number three is out there digging addiction to summer heat and somebody says I'd like to see the work request that sends you out here at 10 9 A.M on a Friday that's outrageous show me the work request that's a public records request it's an outrageous one but it is one here you go ma'am this is how you get that I'm gonna go back to digging my ditch and I don't mean that divisively I just mean that's the job come on so with that the law changed so that if we have that posting we have some protection and it's not automatic fees I was just reading a Judicial opinion this afternoon on a case where somebody was arguing when I made the request that was my five days notice and the court said no that's not how that works you make the request and then you give your five days notice they're not one in the same um the city ended up having to concede that violation because it took them five months to respond and produce the record um that is not a reasonable time period by the way um so that's a whole different issue but things to consider so again beware of traps as you navigate the public records law and the best practices for you folks leading out of this is know who the custodian of the record is generally our city clerk here it's Patty Gentry do not insist the individual identify themselves their affiliation don't insist they reduce it to writing I'm not telling you you can't be a human person if someone asks you for a record and again this really shouldn't happen to you folks but if it does you don't have to say I'm sorry you can't it's not a violation of law to say I'm sorry what was your name it's when you condition it that way so if you have the natural inclination to ask who the heck is talking to me that's okay just don't double down they say do I need to identify myself no sir you don't no ma'am you don't I was just asking to be polite and figured it would help me get you the record but so it's okay to have normal conversation just don't make it a condition of the of the production um so that was easy perpetuate communicate formalize that's public records I'm going to transition to Sunshine Law to again be respectful of your time but with that are there any questions about the public records law that we didn't address yet foreign just crushing it out here okay um I want to apologize to anybody watching this video that is a very unflattering image on the screen at the moment [Music] s in a second I'm gonna get back to sharing the screen here all right so we were in chapter 119 we're leaving chapter 119 in the rear view transitioning in chapter 286 the Sunshine Law where the rubber meets the road for you guys this is where the real work happens as members of public boards and bodies so welcome to Florida the Sunshine State as we drive forward public meetings and an opportunity to be heard let's see if I can get this work one second it's not gonna work not going to work with all the the everything we got going here so I'm just going to skip over it but public meetings are meetings we heard this is a clip a clip from the show Parks and Rec if you haven't watched it it is the best representation of local government you will ever see it captures all the absurdity all the earnest dealings in this particular one it culminates in a woman's public comments saying I was walking through your Park the other day and I found a sandwich on one of your benches and I want to know why it didn't have mayonnaise on it um which sounds silly but it's a little bit of what we can see in some of our meetings my favorite public comment by the way that same meeting I was telling you about with Sea Oats and Sand Dunes a woman came forward this was Circa 2017 so 2016-17 so we've got Isis in full swing a lot of globe you know geospatial issues a woman comes to the microphone and says there's a lot of dangers in this world today and Sans Spurs is wonderful and she proceeds to explain how stepping on a sand spur can lead to a cut which can lead to an infection which can lead to amputation she was outraged because sandspurs are one of the protected species you're not supposed to remove from a sand dune so never a dull moment in local government but again I told you last time we're going to start with our constitutional duties our constitutional Duty here is that all meetings of our public body shall be open and noticed to the public shall again all the meetings [Music] reflected again in Florida Statutes chapter 286 public meetings should be open to the public at all times and no resolution rule or formal action shall be considered binding except is taken or made at such meeting and you have to provide reasonable notice of all your meetings so it's constitutional statutes the next thing we look at is the common law that's just what fancy word for what judges say the law means any Gathering of the members where the members deal with some matter on which foreseeable action will be taken by the board should be a public meeting the statute should be construed so as to frustrate all evasive devices that's the if you think you found a way to get around it you found a way to violate it real thing I heard once oh don't worry I just wrote it on a napkin and left it in his mailbox still a message between two board members still a problem um the fact that it wasn't on official letterhead is not the solution the law must be broadly construed to affect its remedial and protective purposes that's what the Sunshine Law is about by the way just a fun little anecdote the Sunshine Law is not just great clever branding because we're the Sunshine State actually comes from a famous jurist letter to one of his girlfriends whose girlfriend at the time who said you know I think the Affairs of men would be better if the son were allowed to shine in and disinfect all this corruption I'm paraphrasing he later put it in an article in the Atlantic but it started in a letter to his lover so just man step up your game here um so we talk about perpetuate communicate formalize when we were talking about public records the key thing here in public meetings notice location in minutes and I'll add public comment is sort of a part of that but notice location minutes that's the thing that makes a public meeting a proper public meeting notice was given of this because we're all here talking potentially business so to avoid any issue we gave notice of this it's in a location that is open to the public minutes are going to be taken Kyle is going to write down convened presentation given adjourned there's no real votes happening tonight so there's a lot less to talk about but notice location minutes that's what makes a proper public meeting uh for purposes of the Sunshine Law so let's start about the first one notice what kind of notice do you need standard lawyer answer it depends the notice we give for Ian is off the coast and we're implementing emergency measures is very different than the notice we give for we're changing the skate park hours by resolution right uh we're increasing the pay of of the council members very different from we are down zoning the industrial sector to a low density residential sector that's land use notice is going to be really high um so something to consider your notice is different based on what you're doing but it must be reasonable a quarter commission must provide reasonable notice of all its meetings uh notice must be reasonable under the circumstances which vary the Sunshine Law does not mandate an agenda announcing each item uh but be cautious because when you're suddenly adding controversial items there may be an argument that you're trying to subvert the openness and noticed element I will tell you that the spirit of the Sunshine Law strongly favors an agenda and your City attorney strongly favors an agenda I don't like going to a meeting and not knowing what's going on as Yogi Berra famously said if you don't know where you're going you'll end up somewhere else so if we don't have a plan our night can go a lot of ways enhanced notice on occasion statutes require more notice usually around land use so with your boards of adjustment our Planning and Zoning commission when you're talking about comp plan amendments heightened notice sometimes meeting location it can't have a chilling effect all persons are prohibited from holding meetings in any facility or location which discriminates on the basis of sex age race greed color origin or which operates in a manner as to unreasonably restrict if you're having a hearing on housing in your community and you're having it at the hall for the daughters of the Confederacy probably not a great idea I'm not making any value judgments and if you don't know why that might be a problem for a sector of your community read a book um so that's something to consider it can be a challenge Ada accessibility you see when you come to your city hall it has a ramp um it has multi-floor facilities have elevators at this point 30 years later we're all pretty comfortable with that many years ago in Florida in one of in actually in one Beach Community in Pinellas it used to be that for the purpose of meetings City Hall would be the home of whoever was mayor and so they would have their meetings there this is a flirt of yesteryear in modern Florida that price would have to be equipped for people with disabilities to have some access to that meeting um meetings can be held out of town with some demonstrated rationale I'm not going to get into all that for you folks but just understand the location has to be open to the public when I say open to the public I don't mean a place the public can go like an Applebee's the public can go there but Applebee's can say we don't like the cut of your jib goodbye everybody's welcome at all times unless they become disruptive on the minutes of a meeting minutes shall be promptly recorded and open to public inspection the promptly recorded thing is the one that usually gets my volunteer board members because they're like well we met in April and then we didn't meet until September is did we have to have a meeting just to adopt our minutes in you know may no um the media the minutes are prepared and recorded as though as the organization does its business um I've seen a board adopt adopt minutes from a year ago because they hadn't met for a year um they were generally prepared by the clerk long before that but having them in that draft is a public record uh but when it's approved um that can be at their next meeting um a guideline one moment a guideline on minutes they just have to be a brief summary reflecting the events of the meeting the substantial events of the meeting um you don't have this here some clerks missed a calling as romance novelists be like commissioner Roberts looked on with disapproval there was attention in the room the malays said over the presiding officer tie vote everybody left disappointed um you don't need all that um you know emotions seconds the essence of the conversation for some of you the minutes might feel like this like weird perfunctory thing we do they really do have value one they are considered the official record so look at them if it says you said something you definitely didn't say suggest that you change that because years from now it will be deemed what you actually said um and so I've I've been in a situation in one city where I had to after 10 years after they adopted a charter provision I realized that what was posted online was not what they adopted and the only way I realized that was going back to the minutes from roughly 10 years ago and saying what was done listening trying to listen to the meeting looking at the minutes and determining oh yeah what they voted on is not what is on they posted the draft not the final so those minutes really can have value or as an as an example we received in this community a letter from a Civic activation um Civic activist last week about an ordinance and says oh the ordinance says this my first question to call was can we get a copy of the ordinance and see what they were thinking when they adopted it what were they trying to address so we can better understand what's at issue here um so those those things do become valuable especially as your leadership can change and you lose some institutional memory in your community the reasonable opportunity to hurt used to be until about eight or nine years ago that in Florida all it provided was what we've talked about meetings had to be open to the public but there was nothing in Florida Statutes that said and they get to talk um and it wasn't until somebody sued and said this is outrageous I sit there all night they never let me talk it's pointless and the court that was hearing that case said I hear you and I think that there's validity to what you're saying but the law doesn't say you get that right so lickety-split they changed the law and since 2014 members of the public shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard during the decision-making process within reasonable proximity and time before the meeting at which the commission takes the official action it's a fancy way of saying the public gets a say before you vote and that's the way that works typically and and your boards you'll see that you're open to the public okay before we vote and you've seen that here for you folks who just love the theater that is the city council meeting you come and you see okay we have an amendment public comment on the amendment we have the first reading public comment on the first reading second reading public comment on that because the public gets to say in the process so when is that reasonable proximity I've not seen that tested and so consequently most communities do it before each official action some communities go way over the top and they do every single thing we're commending the Boy Scouts any public comment hurricane preparedness plan any public comment the law doesn't quite say that but it's a way to ensure you never have that issue [Music] um it doesn't apply to some things emergency situations hey we're having Ian's off the coast we don't need to have two hours of public comment um that we're just trying to meet and disperse um ministerial acts you usually don't see public comment on the minutes ceremonial proclamations um there are some meetings exempt from the Sunshine Law that won't apply to you folks in your subordinate boards it's mostly for the council where we're in litigation or other things and then quasi-judicial hearings but there's an exception to that exception which basically means the public gets to come in anyways um for those of you on the board of adjustment and I'll talk about a quasi-judicial hearing for those of us unfamiliar with what that is in a moment any questions so far in public meetings yes sir so if the zoom meeting is recorded if it is a public record I will tell you that while we have to have minutes there is actually no legal requirement for most public meetings that there'll be an audio or video recording the fact that most communities do that is for our convenience it's easier to make the minutes if I can listen back to the tape um we do not have a requirement to record a meeting similarly there is no legal requirement notwithstanding the fact that everybody got super used to it in 2020 that you have remote access to a meeting whether that be through YouTube Zoom or otherwise maybe the law will change on that but right now there's no requirement of that if a city does it they do that gratuitously or because their code requires it if you can make your own rules at least for a little while on Tallahassee seems to change that by the minute but if you have if you don't have anything in your code about it there's no statutory or constitutional requirement that Zoom access be provided if you provide it I recommend that you make that that comment feature available for those attending again not a legal requirement you could say if you wish to comment it's an open meeting coming to come to the meeting if you wish to observe we have it that way you can do that the question was asked the last question sorry was about um recordings and and remote particip remote participation by the public the gentleman's second question is on what about board meetings where a member of the board or the council as it were appears remotely um the informal guidance on that you won't see it explicitly in chapter 286 but the way it's been interpreted and I understand the rationale for it at least is that in order to have a quorum which is the basic number of people who need to be here so we can legally have a meeting you need to have the Quorum physically present and other members can appear remotely if you have a physical Quorum your own rules of procedure May dictate that as well in some communities you can only appear remotely by a majority vote of the council and if it's not approved it's a non-excused absence and Exxon excused absences can result in removal and blah blah blah blah that's a local rule Community to community but by Statute physical presence must be present for core any other questions on on appearances video remote comment anything by the way the rule of thumb um heretical though it may be for the Sunshine Law is wherever two or more are gathered from the same board discussing City business that's a meeting and that meeting should be open to the public I don't know if Jesus is there but that's a meeting so if you're meeting with a fellow board member to discuss hey we've got this variance I just kind of wanted to pick your brain because you're an architect can you help me understand what they're talking about from the crown of the road and what all that means don't do that do not meet with your fellow board members to discuss matters that are or may come before you um so for most of the time in your boards and especially with a board like the CAC you're usually talking about what I would describe as legislative matters we just kind of get to make it up we get to make policy we decide that it would be wise to have three percent return on this or a you know an investment let's recommend an investment in our Parks over our marinas or whatever whatever those are all policy decisions you have a lot more freedom with our boards of adjustment and to some degree our land planning or plant Planning and Zoning Board though the more rare you're usually dealing with quasi-judicial hearings especially with our Board of adjustment variances quasi-judicial special exceptions quasi-judicial well Randy how do I know if I'm in a quasi-judicial hearing one Randy will say so just to remind you but two you're looking for criteria where there are discernible criteria the thing that all of you have heard some of you have heard me say when I get new quasi-judicial hearing is in a quasi-judicial hearing you are no longer making the law you're applying the established law to these competent substantial evidence and testimony you hear today so in order to get a variance you need to establish one two three four five those are the criteria if you think six should have been oh well what does the neighbor say if your code doesn't say what the neighbor says is a criteria doesn't matter we're only looking at these five criteria and then you're waiting for them to talk about it or hardship unique to the property that the date that they did not create that is the minimum variance necessary to get the relief and use of the property those are what you're looking for whether it's going to be pretty is not usually a criteria it's why I like when an attorney or an architect comes in the hearing because usually when they come to the hearing they know they're talking to the criteria listen there's no other evidence to the contrary I've I've told you you should do it staff told you you should do it there's no evidence that says you shouldn't you should vote in my favor all the evidence weighs in my favor when you get somebody who's like I think this pool would really improve the Aesthetics of our coast and this awning is just beautiful it's once you see the color blue it's inspiring really that doesn't speak to the criteria we're no better off for that testimony and now you're left with just what the staff report says and what you as a board member may be able to solicit from them through questions to try and help get them over maybe or try and determine if they can't get over right let's say for example they're applying for a dock and you know that in order to get a doc you need an established Seawall and they haven't said anything and there's nothing in the materials about their Seawall then ask hey do you have a sea wall on this property yes it's been there for 30 years great you're checking a box right and they may not realize it but that's what you're doing so on for members who are newer to working with me uh you may have heard me advise against um inspecting quasi-judicial hearings advise against site visits or ask you has any member here done a site visit for The Limited purpose of evaluating this application the reason I ask that is when you're in a quasi-judicial hearing you are kind of like a judge so you're supposed to be impartial you're not supposed to be providing evidence and if you've done a site visit what you've likely done is gone in pursuit of evidence and now you're going to put evidence in the record that nobody's testified to it's just come from the judge you don't want to go to a red light hearing and have the and say judge uh your honor it was only read for two seconds actually I went there this morning uh sir and uh as you know just while I got my Dunkin Donuts coffee and I watch it's a seven second light you're wrong it wasn't seven seconds that day I don't know what you're talking about Judge that's not the evidence um you know they don't want they don't want that anymore in a in a variance or quasi-judicial hearing if there's information that you know or suspect to be the case just ask ask the staff during their testimony ask the applicant or their agent solicit the testimony and make your make your decision based on the record before you what you can't do in a quasi-judicial hearing what you really shouldn't do especially with me present because you'll if I'm already busting out of this shirt and wait till I get mad uh no what you can't do is say I see that there are five criteria here and I find that all five criteria are satisfied however as a resident I find this idea repugnant and I will be voting against it you just said that they passed the test but you're giving them an F that's not how that works you're not making a policy decision anymore if there's a policy decision to be made it should have been made earlier which is to say let's say somebody's trying to put in a vape shop over here and you don't want vape shops in your community address that in your code don't decide when somebody comes with entitlements under your code and says your code says I can have one I want one oh I don't like those that's not how that works um so you're looking for ascertainable criteria um if there is an appeal or a challenge they're looking for the three things there and this is what you should be looking at the competent and substantial evidence the actual evidence in the record it's not as high as in a court of law evidence but there's a difference between we have a traffic study versus if you approve this traffic in the city will be terrible okay because you said so I'm sure you're brilliant but like what does that mean for those of you on the board of adjustment and the commission I will tell our Council I will tell you that every variance hearing somebody will testify somebody will testify that this is going to fix traffic or ruin traffic improve property values destroy property values or ruin the character of this community forever and they will never have any evidence to support it um it will just be their opinion every single time um every now and again somebody brings an appraiser or an economist or a traffic engineer most of the time that's just an opinion that is not competent substantial evidence absent some documents some and I don't they don't even have to have a report they can have photographs they can have history images study something something to substantiate the position you want to be looking at procedural due process did we give you notice did you receive a letter telling you that this hearing was happening today and you're here right okay they have noticed and they're getting a chance to be heard that's due process essential requirements of law are we looking at the right section of our code if we're here on fences we can't make a decision based on our code about basketball hoops we got to be looking at the right sheet of music ignoring criteria evidence can lead to a policy decision and lead to litigation which fine I've got kids who've got to go to school by all means I say that in just um we don't we want to avoid litigation that's why I'm here this is risk management on some level and if we ignore the guidance we receive here that's how we set ourselves up for litigation that we don't frankly we don't need um I'd much prefer that things continue to run smoothly in this community and that's part of why we're doing all of this when sometimes I'm asked Randy you're talking about evidence how much evidence do I need I've heard this Beyond a reasonable doubt you know standard that ain't it here it's competent substantial evidence you need a scintilla of evidence so what happens if the city produces some study saying traffic will be terrible and the applicant produces a study saying this will fix all your problems and you'll be well on your way to Utopia if you do this for traffic you have competing evidence and the cool thing is you get to decide which evidence you find more credible which evidence you find more credible that's up to you you're the judge I've been in hearings that say well Randy staff said this but the applicant's saying that what do I do you make a decision which one do you find more persuasive I love when there's competing evidence because it basically means either decision is going to be right um but if somebody comes in with all if if staff and the applicant are saying the same thing and nobody says anything to the contrary where are you getting this from that it's going to ruin traffic what evidence are you basing that on um I see that as well when you're making your decision on a quasi-judicial hearing look at the criteria and ground your decision in the criteria something that you might have thought was going to look ugly might be better stated that this is not the minimum variance necessary they're asking for 10 feet and I'm not convinced they couldn't do this with three same result but it's better it's it's legally sustainable if you're going if you're actually speaking to the criteria any question on quasi-judicial hearings it's a bit of a it's a bit of a deviation from the standard Sunshine loss stuff but especially for my board of adjustment members this should be a little bit old hat but it's very very critical um to understanding why we do what we do any questions there all right moving right along just like in the public records law there's um there are consequences for violating the Sunshine Law um it can be a violation to attend a statute knowing that it's a violation um conducting outside conducting a meeting outside the state um in violation of law it's not unlawful to have a Sunshine Law meeting out of the state but if this is more prevalent in our communities closer to Georgia in Alabama if you just go across state lines and you know it doesn't count we're in a different area code that's not a thing it's still a meeting of your body um you and we can be assessed attorney's fees I do want to go through a few examples just to drive this home in one Community restroom conversation between City officials raise a sunshine question in that actual in that scenario two council members on a break go to the restroom men's restroom and while they're talking at the urinals there's a reporter in one of the Stalls and notices that they're actually talking about business which actually violates two laws the first one the Sunshine Law and the second you're not supposed to talk at the urinal um the second one in 2011 the governor removed a City Commissioner and others resigned after an investigation revealed they discussed City issues in two separate private meetings the elected officials had to pay fines and court costs I travel the state teaching this stuff uh to communities all over in one community in North Florida they told me yes as far as up to like early 1990s the council would get together at the Perkins or the Denny's the week before the meeting and just kind of hash it all out so the meeting could be efficient like well that was an efficient violation of assumption um County Commissioner and Florida Senator was jailed for six days and paid a 500 fine for discussing business in private with other Commissioners so don't do that um as I mentioned in 2020 we got very comfortable with um zoom and other digital platforms for Access another consequence of that was we got a little more lackadaisical in our adherence to the Sunshine Law and we saw a few more violations when a city saw 31 645 from uh Sunshine Law lawsuit defendant that was where an official was they defended him on the front end and he was found in violation and said well it's not it's we don't pay for you to break the law pay us back another one the Florida Florida Department of Law Enforcement ended an investigation in Sunshine Law by Manatee County Commissioners in relation to the termination of the County Administrator most instances when a charter official that's me Kyle Patty the people who are appointed by the council when they get terminated almost immediately somebody says it's a sunshine law violation it might be because it's hard to conceive how three people or maybe more can reach that same conclusion without having talked about it but it does happen in this particular case there were some text messages between two officials and they said something like on Tuesday do you want to do the first thing or the second thing like full analyze this if you've seen that movie not the second thing let's do the first thing and then when they were asked about it they said oh we were coordinating our ties for the meeting it was nothing to see here I'm which I'm sure is exactly what was happening um a mayor entered a no-contest plea paid 100 fines to settle a Sunshine Law violation case that one was interesting because they were interviewing the the city officials were interviewing somebody for a position and it was in the hallway they said hey have you met with Sandy yet I think she's really top-notch make sure to give her a good look that was it just hey I think that that's a promising candidate Sunshine Law violation somebody overheard it or it was otherwise captured violation so being mindful that you're not talking about business even casually that way this is my favorite one I'm going to spend a little a moment on this this is a recent case study let's do a little bit of World building go back to March 2020 some very major world events are happening the NBA is shutting down the league other people are starting to take notice now the NHL is doing it maybe Society needs to do something we have the high it's the initiation of the covid um pandemic and in in the United States and there was a meeting scheduled in the city of Florida called Sebastian and normally I try not to use the names I'm going to use the names here because I can't I got special dispensation from the league when I teach on this um the manner there was a meeting scheduled for it was like mid-march or early April and the day before the meeting the manager says you know what I'm looking around folks I don't think this is a good idea we're going to cancel this meeting so on the eve of the meeting to cancel the meeting well three of the council members say like fun were canceling that meeting I'm going so three members come into a dimly lit you know just the flood lighting uh City Hall with 12 of their supporters and they call a meeting they've got a quorum so they call a meeting and during the time that had previously been noticed but canceled and then they proceed to fire the City attorney fire the city manager fire the city clerk declare one of them to be the mayor now um and then you hear somebody say and this is on YouTube I encourage you to watch it it's fun it's brief um one of you here somebody on the camera say hurry I think the cops are coming um they and they adjourn the meeting the consequence of that was later some months later when this was all investigated and resolved they had a recall vote in their Community he was the first as best I can tell a successful recall in the history of the State of Florida there's been many a recall vote it's very hard to recall an elected official there's like two and three steps to it they succeeded but not only did they succeed they recalled a majority of their counsel they voted out three of the people not during a regular election but off cycle it was the first time in the United States the majority of the city council was removed as best as I can tell um two council members were actually tried and convicted of crimes for this um why wasn't the third two words States evidence um they turned and testified to how that all happened and how it went down not content to have just violated the Sunshine Law one of the two of them actually uh lied to the investigating off officers and otherwise so then they got brought up on perjury and obstruction charges got their son involved it was really fun whole family affair um the reason I'm willing to speak to this is one of those officials one who was actually declared mayor I believe which by the way is not a thing an action in violation of the Sunshine Law is void at an issue meaning it's like it never happened it's like they were playing Dungeons and Dragons in mommy's basement it's not a real thing um and so the reason I'm comfortable talking about this is that individual sat through this presentation from me and my partner Jay and then called us after the fact it was like Hey I told him I watched your presentation we could do this like no no no no no no it was kind of exciting for me because I was fortunate enough to meet my wife in high school which is to say I haven't dated I haven't really had the luxury of getting to ghost somebody um but I definitely ghosted that guy uh no I you know there's no response to that you violated the law that's not what we said in our presentation the state attorney's office actually contacted us wanting to depose Us by happenstance that presentation was recorded and it was provided uh to them and they were satisfied with that and realized that we said no such thing um but I I say that to say I will not be happy if you leave this with the takeaway that you can just do whatever you want that that's not how the Sunshine Law works that's not why I've taken your Wednesday night so understand that there can be real consequences I think this is as best as I can tell the most um severe punishment once sent it to an estimated six months in jail another 30 days but that was because there were other violations like I mentioned the perjury obstruction and other stuff but that's the most severe thing I've seen attended to a Sunshine Law violation so any violation of the Sunshine Law as I said the action you've taken is voidab and issue it's stricken down um you know some folks you just can't reach right and so you get what they get here and they get stricken down so a commission's failure this was a case of the city of St Pete Beach where the commission's failure to comply with notice requirements that govern the adoption of Municipal ordinance led to the ordinance being declared null and void for my LPA pnz members that ordinance was the ordinance adopting their comprehensive plan big deal so they had to start over on the comp plan which for as we're going through right now you recognize takes some time and deliberate effort um there are some exceptions we're not going to get into them here but just like with the confidentiality and exemption Provisions for the public records law there are some limited exceptions if you do like an active shooter drill for your Council you don't need to notice and publish all of that if we're in litigation talking settlement there's going to be a court reporter in the room but the meeting is closed while we talk about it and then that court reporter transcript becomes a public record later and then it's as if the meeting was open um so there are some exceptions technology is not a rate out if an official Act is taken or public business is being transacted or discussed it's a meeting the fact that you were we were just texting we didn't meet we just texted about whether or not we would be voting on this that's still a meeting um leaving the napkin in the mailbox back and forth still a meeting um I have a I have a bullet there that says beware social media comment threads for those of you unfamiliar with the interface if you get on Facebook especially and let's say we post tonight come vote on Beatrice come tonight there's council's discussing Beach renourishment something that's sure to draw you know some interest in your community what if let's say there's 300 comments on that post what Facebook does is it will show you maybe number comment number one and two and then it has the ellipses or what one of my friends calls drama dots dot dot dot and then it's comment number 299 and 300. well let's say comment number five is council member Roberts saying B tree nourishment we don't need this we our community is fine how it is it's always it's built to withstand this we'll be fine I am not going to be supporting this at all not his stance at all folks just a hypothetical um but let's say he's number five he becomes part of the ellipses then comment number 299 council member Mora gets on there and says absolutely I support this anybody who doesn't would be a fool this is what our community needs looking forward to our Council moving in the right direction tonight I may never have seen Lloyd's Pro Lloyd's post but it is in a publicly available thread and you know who did see it everybody who's at home with plenty of time which is plenty of people in a community with a lot of retirees or otherwise um so just know that you might not have known but everybody else noticed and so just be careful again when we talked about static and dynamic records um when you're in when you're making public posts on threads um you can run into those pitfalls similarly when we talked about quasi-judicial hearings I told you you're supposed to be impartial if you go on public media or social media and say as long as I'm a member of this board we will never ever approve a variance for anything above the established height in our code I cannot be persuaded and somebody comes with a variance application for height they may be able to get you recused from that because you've made it clear you cannot impartially review the evidence maybe they have a very good reason maybe their property undulates and to stabilize it they need to go two feet higher maybe I don't know but there may be factors and then they could they could argue that so being mindful that you're putting yourself out there there's a last Bullet at the bottom called the first bite of the Apple this is a little bit of an admonition and a little bit of advice um in some communities I've experienced the council member or board member who sends what I call the Friday night Merlot Manifesto you've had a tough week you had a tough meeting you got some things on your mind and people need to know him and man this is having earthy tones and it's just making you feel a little salty so you send a three-page email to every member of your board and let them know what's on your mind and in that you have no problem saying the City attorney is a coward the manager is incompetent the clerk is just doing whatever that incompetent manager says and this board has no character no Integrity thank God I'm here to try and preserve some sense and the next time we vote on something like this we'll do the right thing is that a Sunshine Law violation maybe not there's no meaning of the minds you're just kind of shouting into the void void has the four other people who can commit essentially in law violation standing in front of you right the problem is that it's an invitation to a violation it's building the foundation of a violation and just as salty as you felt invariably there's that one person who will not let this Injustice stand I don't mind what they said about me but Kyle shouldn't have to take that I'm going to go for Kyle's dignity and start responding and now we've got a threat now we definitely have a meaning now we have a potential Sunshine Law violation unless we're just arguing whether it's like go to Guppies or go to seaweed okay that's not really a sunshine Lodge but if we're talking about our community and what we're doing here that's a problem so please don't write the Merlot Manifesto get some therapy um but also um just be mindful that that can be can present an issue and if you see that and you say they violated the Sunshine Law maybe not but they definitely made it a lot easier for everybody else to do so or to be a part of a violation [Music] um social and personal relationships I do really want to emphasize this it's not a problem all you board members you could five be five members from the same fraternity who went to college together you could all be married be a thruppel I don't care but you cannot discuss public business when you're hanging out socially or living romantically or whatever it is you do I don't know how healthy that makes your personal relationships but there's a whole topic you just can't touch I have I know I gave the example again I don't know why it's always an Applebee's I get a call like once a year hey there was that really tough meeting and afterwards I was on 19 and I saw Kyle and the mayor and this other council member and they were all sitting at a booth in the back corner of Applebee's I think I saw Sunshine Law violation great what were they talking about I don't know but they looked upset okay it's maybe not a good look but I I don't know what they were discussing I I had without betraying too much I had one situation where there was a pretty controversial meeting the meeting adjourned kind of late not here definitely not here but during kind of late and as people emptied out there were two council members and I think the manager left in the room and they were in that room for another 20 minutes and some people lingered in the parking lot and as people left because it was late the door was locking behind them so there were two council members and a manager locked behind closed doors 20 minutes after meeting that's a Sunshine Law violation I said do you know what they were discussing I don't know but it was pretty it was pretty intense okay you're just body language yeah I didn't hear a word okay so I had to ask because listen I don't have evidence of a Sunshine Law evaluation yet but you can appreciate why after that particular controversial meeting that probably wasn't a great idea and one was like yeah it probably wasn't we were talking about our divorces um but we are all still human people you can have human interactions uh just be mindful that as you're having them you're not talking about business you guys can be golf buddies on the p z board the CAC members can go water skiing for all I care just don't talk about City business [Music] if we commit commit a violation it can be fixed um the solution for a Sunshine Law violation you start over I and and not all you start over not every Sunshine Love violation is incurable most of them are curable my my sister happens to be a physician too much disappointment in my family she did not become a lawyer no um she she's a physician and every now and again she has to sit through a med now practice training and she asked me Randy what was it about it's so disappointing to the family that you made a living doing this tell me what what the cliff notes are and every time I tell her it's the same thing I tell my public officials there are three rules to doing this job right one don't screw up two you're human you're going to screw up when you do don't hide it cure it the third and this is really important for us in public service I have this Affliction myself just because someone says you screwed up doesn't mean you screwed up you may face accusations that are just not Merit that are meritless the second part is what's important here the other joke I have with my sister is nobody dies on my table we just make amendments so in this case if we had a meeting if this meeting was supposed to be open but it turns out all the doors are locked we just have it again and we don't have it again we don't call it order and say hey that meeting we had everybody remember great adjourn you do the whole thing over again if we had voted on an ordinance especially alternatively let's say an ordinance on second reading is supposed to be advertised in the paper this happened to me as recently as a year ago not a year where you got on second reading we adopted it and then after the fact I go to fill out the sheets said hey when did this run in the paper this is supposed to run on the paper I thought I sent it let me find it oh you know what it never got sent it never ran in the paper all right we're doing second reading again next month you just fix it you don't say yeah who's going to notice it'll be fine because that's how five years later something that's super important to you gets invalidated um so just do it right if it was important enough to do the first time it's important enough to do it right um so that's the best process you can cure a violation again in review for us on public meetings it's notice location and minutes um any questions on the Sunshine Law I'll be very quick with you I do want to touch on another I'm not going to go into a slide deck I'm not going to keep you here much longer but I do want to touch very briefly on the ethics code chapter 112. when we talk about ethics in Florida when you talk about it this way we're not talking about Jiminy Cricket we're not talking about wwjd we're just talking about what some mostly dead people and wrote in a law book some years ago and we amended from time to time talking about chapter 112 of the Florida Statutes so sometimes the ethics code might not align with your moral code and that's okay it's just what you have to do and so under chapter 112 there's a few things that we focus on the big one for you folks gifts don't accept anything of value that could be construed to have been given to you to influence your votes and your official acts um and that the test really comes down to what could influence you it could be a penny if you're a penny collector the fact that it's generally worth one cent does not change the analysis so not soliciting and receiving gifts as I said early on there's no special perks to this office you get what the public gets if there are public say there's there's jet ski lifts over here out here in the water if you're not but let's say there were well you're moving and you've got nowhere to put your jet ski and it costs a hundred dollars a month to put a jet ski there and you go to calc I see there's three empty lifts I'm moving over the next two months I'm just gonna put my jet ski there for free and if nobody if if somebody comes to use it just let me know I'll move it and then it should be out of there in two months no the public pays a hundred dollars a month to put a jet ski there you pay a hundred dollars a month to put a jet ski there there are no special perks there's no inroads this is not having a friend who works for the Miami Heat there's no backdoor access um you have there is no but for my job if you are in a position where you're saying if I wasn't a volunteer with the city I wouldn't be getting this you may or getting paid if you're a council member You may wish to start your analysis and start wondering why is this happening to me and is this a problem for chapter for for ethics reasons um that's the cliff notes there conversely don't put the whole pull the hole do you know who I am you know let's say you're leaving here tonight and you're just dying to get that rotisserie chicken we've been talking about you weren't now but the guy said it like three times so you need a rotisserie chicken and then you get pulled over going over the bridge say officer license and registration please license registration no problem here you go officer and oh what's that is that my business card that says I'm a City Commissioner attached how'd that get there um you'd be surprised how much that happens do not pull the do you know who I am I will tell you very quickly as my mother often tells me you ain't nobody uh you are just another person uh so do not pull a do you know who I am not at the chili cook-off not at the IRB beach fest certainly not out in the Great Wide World um you are a volunteer here in service of the public trust and that's really what I want to touch on with ethics when we talk about Ethics in our Florida Constitution and in our statutes chapter 112 it repeats the refrain that you hold your your office as a public trust you hold it not for your benefit but for the benefit of your community and if you find yourself in a position where you are getting the benefit and not the public that's the problem and I don't mean incidentally I don't mean hey you get a stipend for having sat at this meeting that's not the issue I get paid for my time here but I still have an obligation to your residents to fulfill my duties faithfully and honestly and that's really where the issue becomes if you're starting I'm out here I don't really care that this would be good for the community I'm voting for short-term rentals because it's my business I'm going to have here and I'm trying to I have a whole business operation that's what this is for that's not really me doing my job if I'm advising you because I see an angle for me I should be doing what makes sense for your community at large and that's really the charge here um what I'll leave you with in a general sense and this is just a personal plea I'm obviously in addition to being devilishly handsome slightly younger than some of you I've not been doing them 37. I've not been doing this this long or long enough to say that it didn't used to be this way but it didn't used to be this way when we talk about our civil discourse it is critical especially in a community like this that we continue to do what we were taught hopefully so long ago in ethics and disagree without being disagreeable i i in addition to traveling and speaking on this I talk on parliamentary procedure and meetings and the one thing that I emphasize is when you're coming to these meetings debate the measure the issue on the table not the motive not the member don't attack your peers don't attack the public attack the idea if you're against the idea fine if you give you give advice today and you say I didn't find that effective that presentation was not helpful to me that's one thing to get out there and then say that attorney is corrupt and I think he was doing that because he knows but when we do this and we he set us up to fail so that he can just have more losses or something like that that's not great it's not great for you folks as officials when somebody comes up here and says oh that Ron he used to sorry man I just I happen to know you slightly personally he used to work for a bank of course we're doing we're dual finance loans and bonds now self-serving he's got an expertise work and passion to serve the community in a way that he thinks is helpful if you disagree with him disagree on the measure that's not him being evil I will tell you that there's a internet aphorism of sorts that says do not mistake for malice that which can be explained by incompetence so many people are quick to establish that there's some great conspiracy out in the world sometimes we just make mistakes and yes people are collateral damage in those mistakes and that is unfortunate no one should have those misfortunes but they happen it's not happening at you it just happened we happened to forget to open City Hall at 9 00 a.m on it on on a Tuesday and you showed up and but we knew you were coming that day and we didn't want your application no just somebody forgot that alarm my wife's alarm today her phone would not turn on don't know why missed my alarm almost made my kids late to school it wasn't because we didn't want them to see that class you know and so just understanding that as we talk about our dialogue one of the things that was missing from your public meetings presentations read the agenda before you get there um so you know what the issues are so you can do the job better but also then when you get there you understand that this is all about policy and life's too important to reduce to personal attacks on one another and if I could ask one favor of you and that's not because of something that happened here I I give this speech everywhere because it's my one opportunity to be a little bit on a soapbox um I I think that we we do our residence and our guests our visitors a disservice when we continue to devolve the dialogue and go into just retreating to factions you know it's not no secret that I'm the City attorney in Indian Rocks Beach right now they're wrestling with a really tough issue that's being wrestled with globally short-term rentals and in some ways it's reduced to factions homes not hotels versus we love our visitors and what's happened is every public comment somebody gets up there and whether they own a short-term rental or they've been a resident for 20 years the first two minutes of their speech is about how they're actually a good person who should be listened to which is unfortunate we should start from that premise yes I'm a short-term rental operator I have two kids I take care of my elderly mother and like what we shouldn't have to do this just to prove that you're worth listening to all of us are let's just do that let's go about our process with that in mind are there any questions about anything we discussed or something you thought we discussed that we didn't address one last topic I do need to hit on is voting conflicts um it's usually in my ethics presentation Not My Sunshine Law if you are present for a meeting you have a statutory obligation to vote if you are present for a meeting you have a statutory obligation to vote that thing you see in Tallahassee and DC where they wave vote present or abstain you don't have that option unless you have a voting conflict and a voting conflict is narrowly defined as something that makes your money go up or down in a tangible way not a speculative way the reason I'm giving you this advice is when I was a wee bit baby Municipal lawyer one of my first meetings I went to I didn't know that you had to vote and you couldn't abstain and my it was truly like one of the first five meetings I covered and the official goes oh I'm saying on a variance well why well the applicant is my landlord on my commercial property is the commercial property you own part of this Plaza no clear other side of town okay so why is that a conflict well if I vote in favor of it then and I get favorable rent terms people will say that that was my conflict and if I vote against it maybe he makes my rent go up to kind of turn the nails on me a little bit that's screws nut Nails I do know how those things work um that's not a voting conflict oh well we're parishioners at the same church not a voting conflict our kids played Little League for five years together not a voting conflict it's really about your financial interest in the result yes this is for development of three homes and I own one of those three homes I am the architect who designed the project those sorts of things those are voting conflicts voting conflicts are not things that are like I just feel uncomfortable and I'd rather not um that goes back to my thank you the process doesn't work if you folks don't do the hard things thank you for doing the hard things thank you for sitting here tonight and giving me your time I'm not going to rush out if any of you have side questions but yes sir [Music] Mike excuse me are my slides proprietary great question if I wanted them to be I shouldn't use them at a public meeting because that makes them a public record um so I will happily send them to you um I'll send them to Kyle and Patty and anybody who wishes to have them can request them or they can distribute them as they see appropriate um I will tell you that this particular version of the presentation as you can see in the title is from 2021 there's some limited updates that are not in there but generally speaking if you see something in there it should be um you know reiterate what we've spoken about today any other questions thank you very much for your time folks I hope you have a great evening thank you for your patience"
