    "transcript": "all right uh march 24th special city council meeting will now come to order this is kind of uh close quarters uh but everyone like to say the pledge or do we want to bypass it let's do the players i pledge allegiance will you please take the role council member frank banker councilmember leslie doterra here council member lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley here council member mike zabel here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor dave gavis here city manager len reeves city attorney andrew salzman here great the first item is approval of the agenda do i have a motion judy shirley and who the second frank banker uh jody do you have uh anything you'd like to add no thank you any other comments no i have one uh i i don't like the fact that this is one item um it's my understanding that we may only be able to have one item on the agenda is that correct that is correct okay um i'm just going to go ahead and make a comment about that i feel that uh it would be nice for us to have a conversation with the city manager to find out more about why his uh the timeliness of his notice i believe and uh also if there's anything uh maybe we could do to stress that out a little bit um i think we can have those discussions under this heading there okay great great in that case all in favor all right all right so item one accept notice of retirement from city manager lynn reeves and authorize advertisement for city manager position do i have a motion motion frank banker leslie frank you have a floor uh just a question uh not to put you on the spot mr mayor it might be a legal question if we're gonna if we would choose council to do a ladder move like bring somebody up like kyle do we need to advertise this you would still have to advertise i'm pretty sure but go right ahead unless it's in the charter or ordinance that i'm not aware of council can do whatever you want to choose okay um you could that's what i pass this and just decide if that's what you so choose because to go on with that um kyle's been doing the job i think he you have full confidence in him i like to see ladder moves rather than bringing somebody from an outside source that's just my opinion fair enough any other comments then do we have to we have to go through a full advertisement to refill kyle's position or is that just a um if we were to that's that's not okay that's not a charger yeah it's just an advertisement the new city manager would make that okay the motion is to advertise or not yeah okay any other comments vice mayor gunn uh you know i i agree with the promotion from within but you gotta see what's out there you've got to see what's out there you get to see what the range of experience is out there and i understand that promotion from within it's a very valuable tool we saw that especially the last time and it worked out very well for us i think we need to see what else is out there and i think we also need to put the word out there because there may be somebody in the neighboring municipalities who has been working in a job that might be interesting a step up so you know and you know a fair difference to kyle i think he's experiencing he's been uh towing the line on this stuff but it's a responsible thing for the council we've got to look at what's out there anyone else yeah i agree due diligence in all cases i mean i don't have any experience with kyle or anything else but from business perspective sometimes it's a disservice to the person that fleets up because they don't have the experience in the situation outside of this you may need seasoning in a larger more complicated environment that has multiple surfaces such as police fire departments but regardless we still need to do our due diligence yeah i can care with those comments and this is nothing against kyle at all um but i think i think it makes sense to do that i think it's probably going to be logical that that it would make sense to have kyle be the interim uh because the timeline involved with this agenda item we're going to be past that two months i would think so it would make sense to go ahead and move kyle up in the interim position as the city manager while we're going through this process and of course he would be one of the the main candidates for the position i think so i think that makes sense how do we make that how do we have what do we have to do to make that happen to move kyle into the interim position if we haven't filled it officially before um lynn leaves you making that motion to do that am i making a motion to move kyle into the interim well that's what i'm asking about the timeline and i don't believe that that's something that they're doing right that's what that's just that has to be a separate meeting right it looks like what we're uh trying to do is approve uh an application uh or uh an advertisement where we will accept applications all the way through october the 31st so 2017. this is just and i was wondering why we were going so long on that but there are some things that we need to resolve if we are going to advertise and it sounds like the majority of people at least want to see what else is out there mr banker i i heard what you said and would anyone else care to join him in that i mean i think there's no reason that kyle can't apply and he's obviously got the benefit of knowing what's going on he would be within the pool of applicants that respond to our advertisement and you know he gets extra points probably because he hit him well because he's been here go ahead mr gun i was just going to say this precedence already set for all of this for for the new council members uh when lynn reeves came on board that's exactly how this was handled when nancy gonzalez retired so lynn reeves was already here acting we pleaded him up for a while and then went through the hiring process leslie notaro sat on that hiring committee and she can kind of walk through all of this all that's already but this groundwork has all been laid before you know so it's nothing new yeah just to let you know that's since i've been here a very long time in the city that that's how we've always hired we've done the very first city manager was here the committee was made up of three council members and three residents we advertised got a bunch of applications that group went through them uh pretty much did the same thing the last time it was made up of three members and three residents my recommendation to you would be to use the citizens advisory committee it's already established to do the preliminary work and then you know after it's weeded down then you know give it to the council to make the selection and you know maybe a constant member too needs to be put up you know on that but i think that's the simplest the only reason i put that last job description out there was that's what the last one was and i think uh it needs to be updated because it's a different animal now as an example you know i just made some notes certified floodplain manager you need that really for your crs i think you need a hands-on manager working manager you can't uh and there's a lot of city managers out there that you know they're they're the executive but they don't really get involved in the day-to-day operations we're a small community i think you need to look at that uh the construction management the projects uh those are things and now with kind of what the counties did with the building permit process they need to have some knowledge of being able to look at a you know a construction plan for a pool or something and be able to make sure it meets our zoning requirements on all that so we can send it on to the county for a permit for residential construction we use an outside engineer so what we need to do is kind of just update this and i think preliminarily that may be a good thing for possibly the citizens advisory committee to do if the council is fine with that or if the console wants to do it themselves that's that's fine uh you know i'll i'll be glad to edit it and try to update it and then send it i'll have paddy send it out to you and you know you can give me feedback if there's something in there that we're missing i think if i can speak i think that that would be a good idea is if you could edit it and send it to each one of us then we can send patty our edits and she can compile as a as an initial right trying to move it along quickly so yeah that's that's what i was suggesting yeah the last thing that i want to do is just get into a constant perpetual attitude and that we seem to do that a lot with documents well you don't really need to do that in the job distribution because you're going to get the basic stuff and you're going to get people that apply that have never even been even worked in government you're going to get i mean high school teachers college professors you're going to get that back to the point of this job description you're going to put the edits you see they're clear send it to us if we see a job description or a skill missing we'll add it and send it to patty and then there's not going to be a bunch of edits back and forth that's how i kind of see it streamlining patty's dit and all you know she makes the edits and then it gets published i don't think we need to keep going back and forth recommended timeline or a deadline on having this thing ready to go i think if we can have it all done so that our april april council meeting we can have it to find you know give it its final blessing and then send it out that gives us a week yeah i think that's a reasonable timeline okay so i would say well we'd probably put something on the agenda but in case the edits game would put something on to review the final after it's all edited we may end up passing it out the night of the meeting because you're talking four or five days okay so um can we have the first the first draft coffee and what four business days so you'll get it by monday okay perfect and then that way we can or maybe even by tomorrow we can send our recommendations and hopefully by the time the agenda comes out we'll have something to read yeah and consider voting on right and if it needs to be updated we'll we can discuss that at the meeting okay so on this particular on this particular uh agenda item is to authorize for advertisement but we don't actually have the ad so what we do push this out until the next meeting yeah table well you're you're gonna authorize the advertisement once you approve the thing so that that's all this is really saying you're giving we're going to end retouching but we're not we're not approving the ad right right it'll be a two-parter right um all right well while we're while we're discussing this uh would anyone like to ask lynn any questions i definitely have one how flexible you are you on this timeline if we're looking at other candidates we'd like if possible a period of transition from you to anyone to transition knowledge experience well i'm flexible to some degree but i don't want to be here every day the word we let's put it that way i have some plans and things to do and that's you know uh and that's why i want to go north in june uh but you know if i need to come back a few days or something like that that's uh fine we could do which i'm sure glenn would know and you would know we could just terminal leave and then i've used my lead that way and then phil you know if i need to come back a few days just come back and it just ends when it ends it it would be nice if i envisioned you know there's some culling process and then we have perhaps a final interview board with the final candidates it would be nice if if lynn sat in on those interviews i would just like and value his feedback you know yeah you know this guy you know he was sounding good but you know there are a lot of gaps in his work history or something but i think could be an international source in participating in those final interviews maybe perhaps with a refusal if uh you know we bring up her employees yeah i wouldn't want to be in yeah no that's not fair to the employees that's interesting and if there's a conflict scheduling conflict we now have a zoom system that we can use so we'll be more than happy to put uh put you on this i do know how to use that do i patty i don't remember with my headphones so if you say you have a hard date of june is that for an extended period of time do you have someone going to be for two weeks in june is there we've got you're dead in the middle of our budget cycle it would really be beneficial that's why that's why i said you know if we can work something out to come back a couple days here and there to take care of the budget cycle i'm not having a problem with that the budget's pretty much done i'm going to be giving it to the advisory citizens advisory committee actually next month uh i've i've got pretty much finalized i've got to go through it one more time so we'll have our preliminary budget started june 1st is a big day because that's when the first property evaluation comes out the first for us the undergrounding assessment role comes out uh may 1st is the assessment payoff pay down and things of that nature but i'll i've already taken care of that so those are big days but i noticed that you timed it to where you're out of here just before then i told you mayor tell him it's the humidity no no no i i didn't tell you mayor when we talked i i said i'm flexible i just don't want to be here every day we can draft any kind of agreement that has the extended time um or hours needed or mutual yeah i'd like to see that we can do that that's on the phone you know through the period we get through our budget end of august or something you know i mean really well the worst part is is june anyway that's the worst part for anybody you know but but like i said i've got almost 30 days of vacation so i can flex it into what i call and terminal leave they know what i'm talking about huh i understand you know what i'm talking about to you okay well you weren't in the military most people wouldn't know anything about it and we'll have them basically it's like a budget of days that we can you know use okay we'll need five days here and four days here maybe the final day at the end of this yeah now will we need to build something in for your travel to and from i mean i just you know i'm kind of thinking ahead a little bit but i just probably need some sort of uh you know term term agreement but this is yeah you know i mean clearly if you've decided you're leaving 60 days and that's what your contract requires then we should be compensating your travel to come back and help us through some of these items yeah and i i wouldn't do anything but whatever the air travel is i'm not hey i lived here 23 years so you know different story yeah but i mean we don't really officially have an hr director so these are things we probably need to get out in the air and make sure that it's covered in agreement i'm sure andy can yeah do that i do a lot i'll give him a lot of hr so that's not a problem i'll give him a copy of my current contract and maybe we just have to do an amendment to it or something i do have a question about uh the the role of interim uh city manager whenever that time comes kyle's going to be spread then so is this something later on down the road we look at hiring someone else to help with the workload or you know what's what's the future of this office looking like anyone i have any comments on that you mean if he's interim yes well would i do it for nine months before i had the replacement you did it okay all right sorry kyle discover the title hey it's uh part of the benefit i would think uh you know we've almost got like the perfect storm here you know new council city attorney city manager budget cycles coming up a lot of things coming up time is really the essence and the road map how we're going to get there is more important making sure that we stick to a compressed timeline we don't want to get into the april medium not get anything done and drag it out until okay well we'll do that work session that's two to three weeks later and we'll no it's you know may and if we don't if we don't stick to the thing we can have a special meeting the week after council meeting and we stay until we hammer out what we want in the uh rfq i mean we set a deadline we set a deadline you know just keep kicking it down the rules and i would suggest too that maybe you do the work session a week earlier than the third week i agree in case we need another one is that you know you've got a lot on that work session i mean we've got a couple uh ordinances and a couple other things that we need to have some discussion on uh so there's two or three things that i need the input of the console going forward with a couple things so you know code fines things of that nature so if i would recommend that instead of the third week actually the third week is the day after easter we do it the week before the monday before it sounds good the plan of the action milestones what's the what's that the definitive dates uh that would be the 11th of april 11th is it the 11th yeah yeah the fourth is the first monday and the 11th is the second and that gives us enough time if we need to do another one this weekend yeah everybody i mean like i said i would just suggest you move it [Music] and last time they uh advertised it we advertised it in ice cma we advertised it locally we put it in fccma which is the city managers group and some other i mean the last time they did it they we didn't put a salary in it and i that may be a good thing to just leave it that way don't put a salary and say it's negotiable with whoever it is what would be a reasonable deadline on these applications yeah that's what i was going to ask so because if you're going to edit that right now that would be great i think if we had that date already in that on the fourth one so we assume the fourth i think the last time it was like 30 30 30 days i think it was 30 may 3rd well no it was more than that last time it was uh let's see if i can see it doesn't say when it was done here we posted october 23rd and the deadline was october 31st so it was a couple more much time no no you had two months two months and we had a lot of resumes i don't remember how many there were you said october and october did you post them yeah yeah that can't be right right september 31st 23rd 30th no it was posted august 23rd did yeah that's what we did last time in the last two months yeah because by the time you get the ad up to like icma it'll go online pretty quick but then they have other avenues that it goes out to of course fccma they'll post it online and you know you'll advertise it locally we'll put it on the web page and stuff but typically a lot of those will end on a friday so i'm looking at may like may the 13th friday what the 13th how appropriate is there any kind of you know like i know we have to put notices for me meetings and ordinances coming up and things like that do we have that any sort of there is no legal requirement for any type of advertisement other than what council so chooses okay okay any other comments and as far as we'll probably have to do some type of budget amendment during this year so but you can do that after the fact we'll have to assign some tribal funds and we'll also have to deal with personnel or whatever that is extra pay and whatever it takes to get the job done yeah because you'll have some costs for advertising things of that nature i i will tell you locally there's been let's see three different city managers in the last few months and they've spent a long time selecting somebody you know three different communities uh which were they uh madeira was one clearwater clearwater kenneth city was one and recently reddington shores hired a city administrator because they're a strong mayor forum so the applicants i think based on what i've been told were kind of mixed and and we got a mixed bag last time and remember clearwater had no warning they had no no no that's an entirely different job than dollar beach exactly exactly okay any other comments otherwise we'll take a vote does it need to be a voice vote or can we just yeah a voice okay great all in favor of uh accepting uh the retirement from city manager lynn reeves and authorizing advertisement for city manager position say aye aye all opposed none great motion passes and uh that's it for that uh next up do i have a motion for a german motion journal right banker one issue before we do that i just want a quick review of the action items coming out of here we've got the job description that's going to be coming out monday or november monday yes work session is going to be scheduled for the 11th april 11th a devoted one to coming up with the job description rfp and then at that thing i guess we can discuss the plan of action and milestones tomorrow and monday and then we can all and then we'll we'll send our response back and then whatever uh the combined effort turns into will hopefully approve it on uh the next regular council meeting and uh yeah i guess i'm thinking more of the the work session is devoted to the road map of where we go after that that's fine yeah an interview how we're gonna call it who's gonna have what responsibilities in the initial cut the recommendations interviews search into that as well no it's an rfp it's due uh the 12th yes but back to what you just said you're going to have to have a special work session or special meeting for that that'll be something completely separate for the attorney interviews once we find out how many are at peace we all agreed that we would finalize the description of the ad before our council meeting we will have the rfp also at that council meeting do we need it to do we need to rfp for this because you said something for the work session i'm just thinking of open how we go through the actual selection okay so we're just we're just proving the ad period right that's the most important we have to assume that we're going to get it right okay as we can let's vote on it and get this thing posted so this guy can take a vacation all right uh frank banker you made the motion does anyone else have a second i'll say glenn gunn um"
