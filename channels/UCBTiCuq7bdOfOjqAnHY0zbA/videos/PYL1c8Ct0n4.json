and nothing but the truth I do thank you thank you Mr Kelly yes I'm sorry I forgot to recognize the city engineer Al carrier okay that he's president when I asked for the staff report I was going to do so but yeah we are going to have a cow carrier from Dual Associates here on behalf of the city as our civil engineer welcome now thank you for having me okay I'm actually going to go ahead and follow the rules and procedure and even though we haven't learned our agenda for those certain in the audience this is how we're going to handle this meeting tonight I will actually read the variance request first tell on behalf of the city will bring the staff report the applicant will then actually make a statement at the podium we'll have open discussion regarding the variance request we will go ahead at that point and go and vote on the sixth criteria questions that are in your packet and then at the end of that we will have a motion and a second for approval or denial so at this point even though we're down one member we'll go ahead and ask can I write the period I'll read the variance request and tell me at that point we can this is consideration of various request 22-01-228 denalo Drive Anthony Kevin Peggy and Cat lift are requesting a variance from section 10-172 regarding setbacks height and width for swimming pools subsection G it reads the height of a swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road any structural part of any permanently installed in-ground pool or Spa shall not be built higher than 24 inches above the pool deck including race Spas raised pool beams upper level Decks that raise waterfalls auxiliary deck mounted equipment such as handrails ladders grab rails diving boards and slides shall not be subject to the height restrictions set forth in this section this variance is to install a pool and spa 14 inches above the maximum height Allowed by coat thank you thank you okay so I have some prepared comments I'm going to read verbatim people so write down my thoughts and period so the parents over you're asking for is a minimum difference between our patio and the 18 inches currently Allowed by code that difference is only 14 inches history of our home our home was built in 72 other than the roof in AC there are no changes to the land or the home prior to our ownership purchase the land you know in 2016. at that time we had to replace an agency wall looking at we had a pool span built into the UC Hall we renovated a portion of Home in 2017 adding some square footage we kept the grade the same we didn't raise it and our greatest remain at this present level Central home was originally built we had two adjoining neighbors one more south and one to the north the home to the South as it pulled that because approximately two feet higher than our proposed pool deck the home to the north as a pool deck that was approximately six inches to a foot higher than a proposed pool deck both of these were constructed prior to the current coordinates provided some photos for you you can kind of visualize and see what they look like our proposed pool deck will not create any flood danger to our neighbors as our homes are higher in elevation are adjoining neighbors have reviewed our plans and have no objections letters from both are presented for your review and that's also attached there looking around our neighborhood very numerous old homes or pools that come directly off their patio grave many have a similar elevation to our women our older men like others presents a unique circumstance for coming directly off of the patio gray and just makes common sense we feel that we're being unfairly affected by provision in our City's code that was poorly conceived the punished older homes that were built at a reasonable elevation again take a look at the photos of the home in relation of the neighbors allowing the 14-inch emitting minimum variance would pose no danger to either one years it will make it possible the most reasonable use of the land and our home and to have a safe a minimum of 14 inches of the soil res anyone have any questions thank you thank you penny are there any letters at all as Mr Gatlin just mentioned from anybody that you've received regarding this variance no I did not receive any okay in Tony's packet did he just read from there are letters if you'd like me to give you these throw both papers Mr gatliff gave me a copy okay right so the neighbors to the North and the neighbors of the South have sent letters of approval for these variants is that correcting that is that is what okay are there any questions for Chris Arnold who's here from Kelly pools tonight from the board you know any questions whatsoever no question okay and at this point I'll ask you when I was a civil engineer to go ahead and read your letters on behalf of the city good evening I'm Al carrier with dual Associates um we're an engineering record for the city we provide multiple services for the city and I have been sworn and we were asked to provide review services for the request for the construction of the pool at 2228 based on the review of the plans prepared by James Hines pe33678 plans date at 12 3120 we had to deny the plans because of adheritance to the city code city code is in division two under swimming pools section 10-174 subset G of subset G the height of the swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 inches above the crowd of the road the crown of the road on the plane set was stated at elevation 5.3 and the request is to put the full deck at elevation 7.8 thank you at this point I'm going to go ahead and read into the minutes a requirement that Tony and I had both had to fill out forms um because we both have voting conflicts for this case tonight it is a absolute necessity that Patty sent copies of all of these two forms to each of the board members in advance of this meeting and it's and it's a requirement that anybody that has a conflict of interest cannot vote but must abstain from the vote so this form which is from the state of Florida ethics commission is acknowledging that Anthony Kevin gadwick and Michael Edward Kelly are both abstaining from the vote tonight as required and we're reading this form into the record and it will stay in part of the record with the city the state of saying that we understand the law and we will not we will not vote at this point we're going to move forward into the condition that is our criteria six questions that the applicant must receive a yes vote yes vote from the six the variants will be approved any no votes of any of the six the variants is denied if you want to use the worksheets we each of us have the experience request worksheets Carol you got

Goldman I Mr Kelly I abstain okay by vocal 4-0 with two extent of abstentions variance requests 22-0 is approved [Music] that's all we have on the formal agenda for this marriage request but if there's any liquid discussion that we will care to discuss or items to discuss now would be the time Tony do you have any comments now that this is already advanced no well I'm glad this is glad to see it behind us and I'm ready to move forward Alan I think we'd like to give you a little bit a little bit of History here on this audience if we can because there's been General discussion with the city manager and with staff and some elected officials that this ordinance should be renewed or possible change um so if we'd like to do a little discussion if we could um Tony is the applicant has had to deal with this myself as owner of Kelly pools and Chris from Academy pools can give you a little bit of information and and we think it would help because as this moves forward the the city council could put this in the form of a workshop couldn't make that easy yes sir trust the ordinance isn't that the procedure yes sir that is protocol we'll tell you how this ordinance came about and what happened prior to 2014 when it passed and see if you as our civil engineer would ultimately give us some opinions there's some help related to this ordinance sorry um Chris you want to come up and say anything about that you want me to explain it you know what okay sure when this was originally proposed there was a lot of from my understanding because obviously I'm not a president of the city but a lot of the newer homes that were being built very high up above playing locally they're going to go to pools at that higher level so a lot of these pools were being constructed were competing views from the neighbors next door and creating water issues with dreams and the neighbors property so um back then whoever was involved with the city and rewriting that ordinance they arbitrarily chose 18 inches I don't know where that came from but that really is a hindrance on a lot of the old houses like which regardless because it would be impossible to build a pool at 18 inches above it around the road because that pool would be below great in a lot of instances so there's really been nobody overseeing that through the years so the contractors of the plant have been putting on the forms what they even put on there and it's never really been checked either prior to construction or after construction so there's probably gonna be a lot more of these coming forward in the future you know unless it's addressed by the council and the city manager don't go away there's houses even adjacent to Tony's home where new houses are under construction now that are a lot higher than his else's for your base elevation we'll we'll call the great the floor level of the house okay so don't you think each of those pools that are coming forward would need to come before our Board of adjustment or the variance needs to be renewed by Council which could happen for a change I will tell you because I was directly involved in 2014 when the mayor at that time who was a general contractor at well respected man in construction had heard from various people that when some of these houses that were built at grade 458 above me that the neighbor's grade the neighbors ended up seeing the back of a retaining wall that was excessive and enough action took place to where the mayor instructed staff and an ordinance a change to this ordinance took place in September of 2014 I was president of the podium at the time the civil engineer for the city was president at the time we both disagreed with the 18 inches above grade we wanted 24 or even 36 for reasonability um we compromise took place at 18 inches was written into that ordinance as the history behind it Fallout of it is now what's happened here Fred your house is even three feet above the crown of the road [Music] we're saying to the city what happens next what would you and would you on behalf of the city prefer to go out when the applications come to come into the city for a very would would you want someone from Dual Associates corruption grades out there to confirm yes or no on the applications what do you think is it just general discussion well generally I think from a plane reviews standpoint um well let me back up we talked earlier about the 24 inches requirement for the finished floor of the house above the crown of the road correct there seems to be some sort of Disconnect at least from the designer standpoint that you know or the pool can't be higher than 18 inches from the crowd of the road so the house comes in and says 30 inches over the crowd of the road pulls decks out of 18 inches you've got four steps to walk out the back here most people don't want that most people want to have more continuous living there um in doing that though raising the entire house and pool area one of my major concerns is looking at the drainage so what happens you know people just shed the water off the bull decks and a lot of times if you have an older home that's adjacent it usually takes the brunt of you know the runoff because she's when people buy buy a piece of property they're really develop they're going to raise the sea wall they're going to raise they want to get the house up as high as they can with the pool deck and then a lot of times um spit in mlc provision in your code that requires that a drainage plan be provided at the time that the seam oil is constructed and or pools construction so I think that might be something else that needs to be addressed in your code in your code when you address the height of the pull down provide a some sort of drainage analysis to show that the water after you're done construction goes over the sea wall if that's where it went originally or a lot of times interior Lots whether it's not a sea wall that's a that's a p-type very well where the water goes back to the street and that you're not affecting the adjacent properties some of the other reason municipalities do have that in their their codes I was very familiar with Treasure Island he's been a consultant for Treasure Island for years you and I have been to meetings at the city of Treasure Island regarding the elevations of pools because adjoining neighbors like you just mentioned are coming to the city and saying this brand new house going next door to me is going to flood us out and the meetings we've had were with Seawall contractors civil engineers and pool contractors this is a major issue up and down up down below not just our city Tony's a victim of this um ordinance quite honestly and and the city according to Lynn Reeves when we met out in cities out at Tony's house with Chris and myself we asked them who checks it on behalf of the city free pre-application approval and Lynn said nobody we're going by what you say even your letter said based on the plan from Kelly pools this is in this this is a violation so our next step moving forward is to go to work session if Mr Gatlin and or others care to to ask the city council to to change the ordinance a revision would be necessary your advice to Allah will be imperative because there's got to be a compromise but just like you said if we're 24 inches above the crown on the road to your garage floor six inches give or take higher another so you're up 30 into the the main floor right there we did have a Patty I'm not sure you would know this and Kyle's not here to to say yes or no we did have for years now a maximum height on a retaining wall about around a swimming pool around the deck four feet no higher in the city at 48 inches there's retaining walls all over the city at no higher than four feet because that during the time that diesel that the ordinance was written with this um not the 18 inch maximum but it pulls built it great that's how we solve the drainage issues so do you have one around your pool is there a wall behind your house if there's one around here retaining wall my old following up article and I'm waiting for you know as well so great I get Tony's case when you build a new c-1s when you build them in Seawall it's usually 18 inches or two feet higher than the original Super Bowls right right so when you do that it changes your whole back brain don't you think what we're talking about is modernizing this whole approach yeah because everything has changed and even the grade of the street has changed they had a they had a big uh they went over all the ordinances like five years ago right at the moment yeah so I should have been nobody thought I'd address them at that but it should have been but they didn't have us that's true that I mean you even know this we had a lot of good people it should have been addressed right if we tried to all the audience right we tried to adjust to address that in in the Cobra Vision committee which I was on you came to sell in the Middle East you had to deal with those issues when you were getting your veterans um they've got us into who's a citizen before he was even elected so it's got to change out and it it'll have to go to a work work session first Patty if that's the procedure that yes sir that is I also think that there has not been discussion there is not in this building activity for years so right now we have four phones being built in my cul-de-sac on 22nd Street before and it is chaos are not 18 inches but all of us would be working around the clock to review every variance based on what they're doing right yeah so I think they should think about modernizing when I'm 100 in for doing it that's exactly the hit the nail of the hedging because now the biggest issues this board of adjustment has ever heard in the past has been pools dots Carolyn Leon what else have we done here and the plan isn't to have every very every new home that's coming I have to get a very have to get a variance that's why we look at the bigger picture and Tony and I discussed them with Lynn and Chris do we go for a variance on this collectively it's his decision or do we do an ordinance change and Lynn advised us he said it's easier to do a variance time-wise that is to do an ordinance change so would you help us if we go that route sure yeah [Music] that reviewer standpoint so because quite honestly a lot of these pools are flying under the radar right now okay the applications are taking place um statements that they're being made either by the homeowner or the pool contractor says we're no more than 18 inches above the grade then the pools get built when they're out of the ground three feet and it's look at Howard Drive there's two monster houses going in at the airport David is at one at the end of Howard I'm not sure it's going down apparently it's enormous there's flanking vacant Lots on both sides um either our board's going to get a whole lot of variances or weight chain two words and that's kind of where we're headed higher than you so engineering wise what do you do to prevent Tony's house current people from getting overloaded by water well the way our pool and our deck is designer that doesn't go from a lot line to lobbying at the grounds there we have our present grade on either side of the board so that's everyone's water flows is either neighbor or over it would alone [Music] so it's like that's right yeah yeah so you have to have some sort of not like graded second I was saying yeah I think drainage needs to be addressed yeah it's you know and so a couple of those phones that one down there on both you know looks like five to six foot almost above the above the road and the house right next to it as we came all that's at least six foot it's not seven that they're looking at right there now that happened the one Tony's talking about happened in 2009 and the backlash was incredible because that I mean they built the pool had great and the house was raised up four feet out of the ground then you needed a good definition to look great is and at what time that the grades was actually established um and you guys are not unique the Treasure Island has a has a code um in their code they don't allow anything higher than three feet in someone's backyard they established great at the Seawall house next to it is now looking at essentially seven or eight feet of the size of a pool and the fence and then the hedges so I know every loss different every lot is um unique but to your guys's benefit a lot of lots out here are a lot higher a lot meaning that maybe a couple feet higher than most of the ones I see them like the treasure on them check around in Madeira Beach so you guys have a little bit of relief to work with which helps tremendously um I did want to touch on you kept saying we're Camping World you're talking about return walls off of the sea wall perimeter walls around the outer deck of the pool oh okay or foot eye walls maximum in the city I don't honestly know if it's still in the books but it has been forever um when the county was doing planar review um you had to come in and show that you were building a maximum of a four foot eye wall on the outside of your pool and the elevation of the pool might be relative to that to that wall so many of the homes David even like Pat magovich's house right down here that was built five or six feet out of the ground she had to have a series of steps out coming out of the home down to the pool does yours have steps coming up to your floor stepping down and that's so you walk out and I say look but a lot of these houses that again take six feet above a grade quote unquote to the actual ground before the house established a new brain six feet five feet higher those houses if you walk around the city do have steps coming down in inches eight inches eight inches in order to have a maximum wall around that pool or forefoot there's violations on that all over the place too and the house Tony just talked about a month before our governor Boulevard at Belmont Avenue the people in the back are the ones that got slammed and that had a direct effect on the ordinance change in 2014. 18 inches was a ring just it's time to be correct I'm curious if you have the pool deck it's three or four feet high but existing rate and you guys are reporting for railings around that pool deck if it's about over 30. every two of us you know it's where we go next and that's a big question so do we have a meeting um this goes to council doesn't it or do we talk to to someone from Council have to bring it to a discussion to go to war says who establishes the agenda at a work session the city manager so Mr Kelly you probably would want to talk to Mr riesler to get it on the agenda for a work session okay does it mean any kind of um to put the item on the agenda does it need a council members recommendation or it doesn't have to come to from a council member no it does not okay well is it the consensus of our Board of adjustment that we'd like to see this go as we're just going to work session and we can give input yes yes okay hey Mike Michael I was going to ask Mom if you're out there all right as far as any any permit that's pulled in the city I've had an experience recently I think all the permits should be inspected by Mr carrier or representative from the city before the permanent is issue because um just to give you a little idea I had to remove a black wall on my property and the neighbors have been putting their soil up against that wall for the last 20 some years and that wall has to come down and now that property is 12 inches over my property and they have a retaining wall that's there and it's over the retaining wall because that sea wall has been raised so we've got all the soil and all that water now will spill over into my property so I think all the permits that are issued in the city need a review before their issue once they're applying for and then somebody inspect them inspect the ground and expect what was going to be done whether it's a fence or a driveway or anything to make sure the drainage on these properties this are going to be effective one way or the other um thank you Mark pal are you happy to do that at all now um or you just go by the architectural plans if if there's any question we'll go out into a cyclist that we go for both uh Treasure Island Beach but sometimes the plan doesn't always show you what's actually going on in the field sometimes there's a plan changes right here in construction and we'll be called up so we do provide those Services Barb that's what you're talking about writing a site isn't well a site visit correct I mean my permit was pulled to remove the wall and the neighbors have a permit for a fence and the fence is being put in but the the level of the land is not being addressed at this time so there's going to be water spilling over on my property if not ground and there's an issue but if it would have been inspected before they would have found it there was an issue but unfortunately now things are going to move forward the permits have been issue and that probably will not be addressed patties of the recommendation is that you think I should go to the city manager and discuss this and hopefully put in a work session yes sir any other comments from any board members or anybody in the audience if not I want to thank Mr Gardella our newest member on the board of adjustment for coming in because he's late he has to buy drinks up the hill and Bonefish at what time tomorrow I want to apologize to the board and the applicant and now I was dealing with two AC repairs at the apartments I have and time got away from me and I had to get the guys in these apartments with the tenants now so I apologize for keeping people like because of my attention we're glad to have you you're the first man that's right we already did everything we're done yeah we're done since we're done I'll entertain a motion to adjourn so who Mr Bean Mr Elia members of the board thank you for an interesting meeting now it was great to see you obviously we will be seeing more of you not only in Board of adjustment cases but and the issues involving us to make this ordinance be updated directly with common sense we stand in Germany"
