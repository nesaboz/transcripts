    "transcript": "foreign foreign thank you [Music] good evening everyone it is Monday May the 22nd 2023 and the Baylor Beach city council work session will now come to order please rise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all Kyle would you please call the roll council member Frank Banker here council member Belinda Livingstone here council member Leslie Notaro here councilmember Lloyd Roberts here council member Mike zabel vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle riesler I am here City attorney Randy Moore president thank you city manager reefler all right let's just get right into it we have a it looks like a small agenda but it's actually kind of big so let's just go ahead and get started with item number one which is to review the 2023 comprehensive plan review recommendations for the Planning and Zoning Board this was placed on the agenda by City attorney Moore Mr Mora uh thank you so the city has been working on its comprehensive plan amendments as part of its regular cycle for doing so um let's zoom out a little bit Beginning by explaining what the comprehensive plan is I know we've touched on this in the past but your comprehensive plan is like your Constitution and your Land Development regulations your ordinances on Land Development are like the laws and statutes that flow from it you cannot build in a community in a manner that is inconsistent with a comprehensive plan subject to some things Tallahassee has done of late and so um that's a that's that is to say a comprehensive plan is critical document it is your visioning document it's what bounds the development and um Aesthetics and all the other elements of your community in a broader way um a comprehensive plan ordinarily has to be Revisited and revised every seven years we are on that interval um and so playing a slight bit of catch up but getting it done I've been meeting with um myself Kyle Patty and Linda Fisher from four of Pinellas have met with the Planning and Zoning Board on on at least three different occasions to discuss revisit and revise this and what you have before you is the draft that Ford Pinellas has produced based on recommendations from the Planning and Zoning Board some housekeeping that had to be done as well as some updates that are mandated by the legislature of language that you must have in your comprehensive plan um the the cliff notes version of that is some of the housekeeping amendments were updating data and analysis for the community such as your population figures projections updating the maps and such as the future land use map and boundaries updating your schedule of Capital Improvements to reflect your current priorities established priorities uh updating some other definitions and terminology some of the the more substantive amendments that you'll find in there in terms of the amount of strikethroughs and underlines attendant to them really have to do with bringing this comprehensive plan draft into Conformity with three specific Florida Statutes the first being the Peril of flood act from 2015 which requires local governments to address topics such as repetitive flood damage and sea level rise The Bert J Harris private property well within the Bert Harris act the private property rights act in 2021 sort of attended to that the legislature thought it important that communities memorialize in their comprehensive plans a series of property rights that exist but you sort of I guess an ethos or or mission statement so this new element is added in this draft another is there is a bit of a hat tip to an uh an act adopted this year the live local act um otherwise being colloquially referred to as the affordable housing act that passed this session one of the things in there is says that affordable housing can be built in certain manners notwithstanding any local ordinance uh regulation or resolution or other Rule and so we at least acknowledge that the existence of that act in the comp plan there are other attendant restrictions on what affordable housing is and isn't and what kind of property can be developed on and you don't have that in your community at present so um not a huge concern but just at least acknowledging um that language there were some things that were discussed in the co the planning Zodi there was one topic that Planning and Zoning discussed and on my advice and otherwise declined to raise which was the acknowledgment of or provision for motel hotel type structures within the within the community or uses I should say more than structures and there was a concern on depending on how far down you go that road do you erode your transient lodging short-term rental restrictions and so that that was abandoned based on a concern of that so that did not make the draft some of the proposed amendments that they did address was recognition of the importance of the Bella Beach Marina you're planning and zoning I'm calling it your Planning and Zoning it's they're wearing the Hat of the land planning agency um if you're if you're tracking the statutes that way but recognizing the importance of the Bella Beach Marina with new policies proposed to state that the city desires to keep the marina as a Marina and prioritize its use for residents as feasible when you're talking about a comprehensive plan the kind of language you draft is is aspirational typically especially when you're talking about objectives and and goals you're not talking in in the same way that you would a Land Development regulation like and the skate park shall close at seven it's you know the skatepark which I'll be open in reasonable hours to administer daytime enjoyment it would be that be sort of the difference you don't create those hard and fast things um so concerns regarding traffic passing through the city that was really The Lion's Share of the discussion in the LPA is how do we control or how can we best manage that the real these being Gulf Boulevard is not cities roadway um and there and you sit between other communities there are limits to what can be done and what can be exacted from those adjacent communities or their businesses and then they addressed a few minor issues including newer revised policies uh regarding Manatee protection regulation of e-bikes exploring new funding um again they didn't outright regulate those things but those were some of the topics they touched on so you have the document before you in full this is a workshop this is not the first hearing on this we there is a draft ordinance attendant to this process and and you will see that but before we prepared an ordinance for this body to consider on first reading we wanted to make sure you'd seen the output of that body and also just by way of further education while you continue to peruse those documents the comprehensive plan adoption process is a little different than your average ordinance usually we have a first reading second reading we're done there's a little bit of a flow chart up and down where we we do a first reading we send it to Ford Pinellas they say yeah we're good and then it goes on to Tallahassee tallahassee's division of Economic Opportunity kind of gives it their own blessing and says okay you can move to your second step so if you see that if you see this understand that there's there's a little more bureaucracy involved in this particular kind of amendment but because it is a big deal it is your comprehensive plan um but I just while you looked at it I want to make sure you're also aware of some of that process so that's what you have before you tonight the workshop the the ask from staff is whether individually or collectively you had any concerns in the draft that have been circulated to you in advance of the meeting anything that you were wondering why is it this way or how can we address it I I can't profess I I will tell you I did not draft this document specifically this has been prepared this is a planner's mind a planner's view I've certainly looked at it and reviewed it but if there are things that are incred that are that are a little more nuanced I may say you know we can we can look to that and have get that follow-up from staff on that from the fort Pinellas side but again just looking for if there were any concerns questions comments in the draft as it presently exists yeah anything I missed their Kyle not at all no I have a question concerning the power of Ford Pinellas how much Authority do they have over us I would flip the Paradigm of the question it's not an authority we are self-governing um as much as Tallahassee allows us to be anymore um but this is this is a collaborative process they've been our partner through this process we have an interlocal agreement with Ford Pinellas wherein this and other measures they provide planning services to us we don't have a separately contracted planner and so this was not their this was not by decree from them that this is what you must do this was the input of your board the the Ford Pinellas inputs in this process were largely just the Florida statute statutory compliance and Conformity they are the Metro Metropolitan planning organization and there's certainly some things we have to do that have to align with that but um as it relates to this particular draft I'm not aware of any you know edicts that they decreed shall be adopted by the city and sorry that's just the way Ford benell says it goes that wasn't really how this drafting process worked to my knowledge okay thank you very much Council Mr Banker I guess it's a question for both yous you read over the doc Mr Banker can you get closer to your microphone please I'm sure you both read over the document a few times what is in there that we can't live with present here have you been able to are we able to adjust to this or you know I mean we're complaining looks like we're complying with everything and we're ready I didn't I didn't see anything the stuff that was mandated to be in there you know it was just the wording that they required and then um kind of things that the Planning and Zoning Board talked about uh were just uh in their minds what what the city needed to focus on but I didn't there was nothing I jumped out it was a major issue I appreciate the question I I think again the perhaps I need to do a better job of articulating this is your policy document this is a planning document this is yours no I understand no no and when when I say that is there's not some external decree I don't think there's anything in here that you can't live with I think a lot of it is consistent with what you're already doing is you've sort of alluded to part of what I would say you're this is more rather than an imposition this is more an opportunity if and that's not just lawyer spin this is an opportunity to say hey if there's something on the horizon that we feel we need to address here and say this is the direction we want to take this community from a land planning perspective this is a great time to do it but I don't think with the exception of things you just can't change like putting in regardless of how you feel about them putting in nine rules about private property rights you might not feel like we need them in there we got to do it anyways but it doesn't change anything we're doing or not doing because it's just the law um it's how property rights work in America um so in this in this particular case to answer your question I don't think there's anything you can't live with um because and that's in part because I don't think there's a lot that's being imposed I think the hardest thing if I had to answer your question with anything I think it's the limits of a community in a County that are as densely populated and um interrelated as you are here because a lot of the frustration that the Planning and Zoning at LPA came across and like I'd really want to say this I was like well we can't quite do that because we can't dictate what happens in Clearwater Beach in the bridges so you know we can't say end a bridge another Bridge shall be built you know from here to Siesta Key or something like that you just it may be what we want that's one not how this kind of document functions but also the limits of what we do yeah and the reason I said because you said you know we should maybe have a couple more sessions on this but if it's might be useless I mean oh I wasn't suggesting work sessions this might be the only one if you're if you guys don't really have a lot of feedback I just the first reading and second reading I just didn't mind than usual we couldn't live with or already yes sir that was the question here oh I appreciate it do we have other comments from the council questions I just want to be clear that any any changes or modifications are highlighted on here we can quickly scan through it so that everyone's you know aware of that you're we're not reviewing this entire this documenting this its entirety we can see the change yes they are in strike through an underlying format in fact I think even called out in another color Beyond just strike through an underline um so that it is made so that you can skim and see if something jumps out at you and that's all we're we're asking certainly not making the ask that you go unless you desire to as a body go Page by Page um you certainly enjoy that discretion but in a broader sense I will tell you um I I know this kind of is well known in this community but I I give my hats off to your subordinate boards they really spent a lot of time with this document they did go Page by Page like three times on on three separate occasions and revisiting that so they did a lot of the heavy lifting which I think is part of why it seems may seem easier now um but again as you folks are the ultimate legislative body or governing body here it's um you know again just making sure that whatever where they were tracking is where you wish to go okay and I'm looking at let me see here I am looking at objective 1.7 so this is this is all in light blue does that mean this is all brand new it didn't exist before that seems correct to me I I don't know if some of it I'm seeing some things that are bold so I'm not sure if it was moved but yes that looks like new tech stuff which uh page out of the 44 you own just because there's objectives get renumbered again as you move seconds to page number 23 23 thank you uh one two three four it adds four pages to the document yeah this is and and so by way of example this is one of those statutory inputs that we have to put into the flood Peril um statute and that's why where you see things that are not just one isolated section on a page more likely than not you're dealing with um regulatory mandates there and so that is a mandate that we we don't have a lot of flexibility with it and did you see any red flags in this Edition me um I I did not one thing I was particularly uh careful to review and I would certainly review again uh before we get to any kind of first and second reading is making sure there's nothing that could be construed so as to touch on your transient rental or short-term rental regulation languages as some kind of interpreted um receiving from that I know that is not the policy direction of this body at this stage so I I will look at that again but I looked at it a few times I did not see anything that could be construed in that in fact the language was specifically massaged or addressed you know in that way to make sure that was not on not at issue otherwise I no I did not see any red flags and I think you know to my point answering your first question mayor um staff with Ford Pinellas was very responsive to comments and concerns from the LPA in a few instances there was language in there that either wasn't really doing too much or like I don't love that it says this do we have to do this you don't have to do that and if you don't if it doesn't align with your community even though it was in your comp plan last time around take it out if you really want and so that was you know those kind of recommendations were heated well for instance objective 1.11. the city shall participate and encourage other local governments to participate in the National unified insurance program Community uh rating system blah blah blah so now we're lobbyists for the state of Florida and again I I'll have to um in the meantime I will pull up the parallel flood act to see if that language is directly from the statute I believe it is um what pages that is on page uh 26. got stuck on the term to achieve flood insurance premium discounts for receiving discounts these days you want to start me yeah I mean Kyle does a lot of work with FEMA to make sure that we have we get the city in as a whole we just got our research for class six which was 20 discount and now it's it's tough to see on everybody's policy and if we didn't participate in the program we would see the difference that's some strong language to shall influence other Municipal bodies nearby um that's especially when you've seen every municipality around us is receiving the same document yeah again I can I can that's one topic we can certainly um follow up with and see what portion of that language is statutory mandate how much of that is language trying to capture the essence of a statutory mandate if it's the latter then that will give us some flexibility but for example with the private property rights language which is not what we're discussing it is a script it says put these words in your comp plan um I don't I'm not as intimately familiar as uh with the flood Parallax to know if that's the case um Miss Fisher who will be here for the first reading she was just it was just a timing issue for the workshop tonight for Pinellas does plan to attend the actual um ordinance hearings to facilitate this process but between now and then I can get that information from where I'm doing Google searches now but I don't want to um hinder you moving through your agenda and then I subject to my ability to find it on the Fly that's that's fine I I just uh just want to make sure that these shells are actually what they what they have to now means you have to and that's it's a little troubling right there because what's the next message we're going to get or the next command so that's my comments on that one there's actually Senator Scott Mr Mayor is proposing a bill this week to uh offset the national flood insurance program and bring in more private insures which I think it's going to make it even worse because it's going to be like a Citizens Fallout but so it may conflict with federal policy if that bill went through [Applause] other comments questions on the council on this I think just talking about that 1.11 so Kyle is there anything in there that we're not currently doing I think we are doing all of those things I don't think there's really any issue regarding the fact that we're saying we shall do this because I think it's important for the city to do those things oh it was it was for this city to influence other communities around us but then it doesn't say Xiao it says encourage shall encourage shall encourage I think naturally I do encourage the program and the CRS but I mean I understand the strength of the language I also understand that sometimes Tallahassee doesn't get it right the first time carry that throughout the document though there's plenty of areas where it says that we shall coordinate with Pinellas and Pinellas County and for Pinellas for planning to ensure that planning for pedestrian bicycle paths and bicycle friendly design standards are incorporated into future roadways and projects within the city so I mean we have that on Gulf Boulevard but does that then require us to provide them through the city you know that's not ours Road it's accountable anyway so right right past on 20th Street or who knows what does that mean you tell me well I I will tell you as a visioning statement no it doesn't compel you to ensure there's a bike lane on every road and art or wait artery in your community it compels you to collaborate and we can collaborate and then determine it's not feasible it's not necessary it's not but at least be open to that um General sense and I you'll see a lot of those shells with those and without outside of the 1.11 which I I understand you're concerned with and we can see if that's mandatory language but in a planning document like this there was some discussion for example during the LPA meeting about it says we shall provide for transportation facilities and we're not going to be building we're not part of PSTA we're not looking to build bus shelters and I said but transportation facility is your roadways your sidewalks your walking paths your bike paths you guys spend a lot of time talking about pedestrian pass over the last year and so you're doing that and it's not always the most narrow construct of what the what that terminology is and so no one's ever looked at a comp plan and says you have to build these things it's more it's more what it doesn't provide for that becomes the bigger issue for you as a community and and to um to add to that we are cooperating and communicating with um Pinellas County because we're asking questions and trying to come up with a reasonable solutions to uh help with the traffic and understand your purchase dissipation in The Big C your participation in the mayor's Council your efforts with Ford Pinellas otherwise on their board and looking at the tourist development tax involvement all those things that counts that's all part of that collaboration the fact that you reach different conclusions doesn't mean you failed to cooperate you folks are very involved in your community especially in your community at large and your neighboring jurisdictions and trying to find collaborative Solutions I think you check more of those boxes than you might realize or give yourselves credit for because it doesn't necessarily mean that you cede your autonomy to them it just means you're willing to see if we can work together to a better tomorrow or you know whatever tagline you wish to put on it anything else Council so we'll commit to follow up on the opportunity to read the document yes okay what's the next movie preparing this into an ordinance Mr Mayor yes yes and that ordinance is prepared it was in drafts subject to your input um so the one thing that we Kyle and I will follow up with um Miss Fisher and her team at Fort bennell's to see what what flexibility we have with that language and what an alternative language might look like if we can do that and then we would bring a draft to you as promptly as practicable subject to notice Provisions when you're amending the comp plan there's enhanced notice requirements and advertising requirements so that would be that's the only thing that's going to limit our how quickly you see it next and not even see really any other Show Stoppers I just sounded weird that they were telling us what to say so take away our opinions and uh you must side with us that's a little Troublesome but for the most part everything else looks like housekeeping yeah and you're going to check into that language yes sir and then uh make the recommendation for the next council meeting as as soon as uh advertising and other legal requirements will allow for it yes sir okay and uh just uh so everyone knows I will not be here at the next council meeting uh vice mayor Shirley will be chairing that meeting so you get a nice break from me I do have a quick question um so Randy on Just for example take 2.2 which is on page 30. thank you so they started with in a new language the city shall identify and describe joint processes and I'm I'm sort of familiar with the shells and wills and must and all that kind of stuff but you know better than I do so right underneath that 2.2.1 it says the city will coordinate with which they could have taken the opportunity to say Xiao of what we didn't so there's just some inconsistencies there what do you think is the best adverb or the best verb there is it shall is it will are those similar I I think that they the will language is is more optimal for what the community is trying to do you're making a you're making a commitment to try right versus you shall you shall have this result um I I don't know that there's a lot to be gained from editing the document to make every shallow will or will a shall um I I think the net effect is likely fairly similar um you see it looks like the way this is drafted if you look at it throughout the objectives typically carry the shells and the policies that Implement them carry the wills okay um and so it's it's more of a as a policy we're gonna this is what we're going to do this is what we're trying what we're planning to do it's not by way of mandate it's a direction we intend to move okay that makes sense and and these wheels we we do this anyway of course it's already done yeah but that does make sense so the policies used well on the objectives I get that thank you any other comments before we move on I just I just had the schedule of Capital Improvements I know it's kind of vague and probably intentionally because we've had some more specific and it's been a bad decision because we weren't able to hold to those standards but um I guess just if we could get some backup to this because you know just off the top of my head when we're talking about Gulf Boulevard beautification it doesn't necessarily you know we've got the South and light north of the light what do we you know what it what is what are we proposing we're doing here is that the total project you know that sort of thing I know it's the storm water we've agreed to move forward with all of the projects through the bond issuance um and I guess I just want to be sure that that's so um this is something I brought up in the planning and zoning board meeting um you can see the red where we get crossed out and that was a uh yeah that's too much detail I get that um the uh so it was everything over a hundred thousand dollars um in the budget and um I updated it based on what has occurred this year um this reflects also our draft of the budget so um I can I can get with Linda Fisher about adding some some detail um I think this is just kind of like the layout that's required for this plan um and we just moved the November's based on what's happened well and I'm not so concerned about necessarily adding detail I just want to know what I'm approving here what what I'm buying into like in other words if you say you know you can you know you tell us that this is what the three million dollars is for in 2023 is for everything south of light that you know the 2 million is for everything north of light or whatever I just need to know what we're approving right um correct me if I'm wrong but this isn't the resolutions um and decisions that were approved during our Council meetings are the governing decisions right this is just reflecting it's a current state of affairs yeah it's a reporting element of it it's not um it's it's supplement to your comp plan but it's not a policy it's not an objective you're not bound to it that same way it's reflecting this presently at time of adoption this is where um those are those commitments going I hear your broader concerns I just wanted I want to know the backing I was just answering history in the background previously the comp plan included uh storm a storm water plan that that required we've spent 500 000 or something ridiculous when in fact our number was 5 million so there was a big discrepancy and as an outsider if you look at the comp plan it's like oh they're not doing anything about it you know which is if you're not from this area you might review this comp plan and think that and and that's what I I kind of want these numbers to be someone accurate of what we have planned and that's actually one of the one of the reasons that schedule was removed in whole in its previous iteration and was this is that's one thing even between our last um LPA meeting about two and a half weeks ago and today Kyle was working to get that aligned more currently with where uh fiscal figures are at present um so it that work is being done has been done I I believe um and that's uh but I I hear you're wanting to see sort of the back and forth that's something we can do you know offline and otherwise but that that effort has been made to make sure it aligns with realities on the ground okay and in this document this is uh ten thousand foot view of basically our yeah I don't necessarily want it to look like page 35. absolutely not the less granular the better we are actually but uh I understand where you're coming from probably not a bad idea uh just to show us the math how you came up with this and and uh which I know it's it's all out there but it's probably there's probably a simplified version that we can just piece together and go here's where these numbers meet that or equal that and uh uh something to it would help us out in the future any other questions or comments on this nope all right going once twice all right we are on to item number two which is review the 2019 strategic plan this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefler Mr reefer okay I placed this agenda item based on the last work session that was brought up that we haven't reviewed uh anything to do with this strategic plan in some time and I look back through our records and found that uh the last meeting that was really discussing the Strategic plan was on July 12th and that was when vice mayor gone at the time did a presentation and I did I actually reached out to the vice mayor gone our previous vice mayor gone and got his last presentation his materials from where we left off at so I wanted to include that um in the packet so you all could see um you know what his thoughts and vision was for the Strategic plan um and if you go through the last presentation it kind of this has been covered as since the uh the origin of the Strategic plan but it talks about um assumptions made um in the city it talks about the slot analysis the streaks uh strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats that relate to Bellaire Beach and then it goes and um at the time there's 2018 the council kind of set set aside uh five specific goals for the city um that will help the city reach its Mission and overall vision and those goals our public safety and health tax dollar value communication and community Aesthetics and Beach and water it doesn't have page numbers but about halfway through this page is the last layout of the existing goals with the objectives that were assigned to them it says may 22. I went through that and um took that document and kind of cleared off some of the goals that we've we've tackled this year and kind of opened up to uh new objectives which are the last pages where we need some new objectives to get us to these goals um and the the main stress uh stressed uh idea when when vice mayor Gunn gave this presentation was that it needed to be thought about and included in the budget process so um with that being said um I just want to say some of just the ones that I checked off the list that we had the well the emerging emergency generator funding we decided to postpone that or um not not pursued at this moment we had the city manager selection that's been done the AV remote or the audio visual remote access that has been done um and upgraded the playground decision playground has been installed blocking easement we surveyed the residents on that got the feedback and the buoy decision ordinance we drafted uh read the ordinance and created the new um bathing area Sun Zone so that leaves us with the address and mitigate Street flooding issues which I believe that we're still underway um revisit economic impacts the and Reserve funds um we did a lot of that when we talked about the bond issue but I think that's an ongoing process uh this one I wasn't aware but the Gulf of our traffic monitoring uh the crosswalk 812 street it's ironic because we were discussing the intersection and specifically was talking about that crosswalk which I know um some of the ideas surrounding that crosswalk and what the county is doing with the study um could come up with the redesign if we decided to do anything um all four of our beautification that's the undergrounding project and then after we underground power The Next Step I believe would be the street lighting situation and then Beatrice nourishment we know that's a major issue there's there's alternative funding I know the mayor's been working a lot with the county and getting nourishment moving forward if the Army Corps does not proceed so that's that's our habit um hopefully you kind of just look through and got the um the gist of the of the document um and then what we do need to do is establish some new objectives Council you guys are quiet tonight I do have a question um Kyle you may be familiar with this so once the undergrounding construction begins on Google Boulevard let's say for example there was a street that connects the Gulf Boulevard let's say 20th Street like my street and if we wanted uh in our street agreed to do undergrounding would there be any Financial benefit of attempting to coordinate that with the work that would be done on Gulf Boulevard as opposed to doing it at a different date I would say no I believe we're so far ahead of that kind of coordination or planning um the the current plan now Goes Down Golf Boulevard and it comes one pull into each street but to at this point um have that design and whatever equipment it it'd be a ways out engineering wise to plan okay um plus when you're dealing with in between those houses and those easements you have a lot of uh vegetation issues that right need to be taken care of so it does actually come one poll it comes one pole in um and then what has been done I mean the reason that with Golf Boulevard is being underground is because there is Penny um infrastructure money going to that um the Bellevue Estates Island project was um it was a assessment that that all those residents voted on and to move forward to fund the project I think the history is at one time the whole city was looked at for underground and it was sort of the feedback that not the whole city wanted to do it um and that's where they decided to do that separate assessment for the island okay and then it was looked at afterwards I Believe by Harrison yeah Harrison Avenue looked at it because we didn't have a lot of homes the price was about twice what they paid on Bellevue Isle so her home okay and so obviously getting other streets to buy in would make sense so but get the undergrounding on Gulf Boulevard done first because that brings like on Harrison for instance it brings the power all the way back to Belle Isle not Belle Isle excuse me um hibiscus so so it really eliminates a lot of expense okay you know Harrison also has the under water yeah so so that drives the price quite a bit too so um so there's just some some ways by getting more streets to buy in you know of course Belle isle's already underground it if we could get hibiscus on board taking that down and I know some people on Howard were interested so you know and same with your neighborhood you could get a couple of the streets um interested then it would make it it would make a huge difference yeah okay but you know like for 20 you're such a small Short Street by the time they bring it back to the first house or the first poll which is probably two houses in or something you know right you're not going to have a whole lot more yeah I'll just get out there with the shovel and video myself that's what I'm saying I know so I uh I saw a presentation from uh Duke Energy concerning undergrounding and um there there's no incentive to they don't give any money for undergrounding um but what they said they would do and right now they're doing it down south is they are improving uh the the bandwidth how much energy they could actually pump into these neighborhoods because the homes are requiring more and more power to keep everything running uh and in some communities they're they're building more or they're building up that's usually what happens you knock one of the little ones down you put up the big one it requires more power so what they said to me whenever I ask about what what can we do how can we cut our rates for for getting these jobs done they said whenever we decide to upgrade your infrastructure you are more than welcome to use those funds towards rather than doing it overhead you do it underground and then you pay the extra so they would commit to the money they would be spending anyway and then your neighborhood could pitch in the rest and do the undergrounding so that's one thing to consider because but you're probably going to be waiting a while because there's not a lot of action going on in Bel Air Beach as far as building it's a little one here a little one there and eventually they'll hit that saturation point where they're going to have to bring in more power and you have to remember when you underground you're limited on how much you can transmit because your cable size is reduced considerably to overhead so the future says it depends what will happen in 2024 but we keep pushing electric electric electric electric heat electric cars now you're putting all these cars on this grid and when you hang a wire up top you can increase that as much as you want but you can only use I think we're at Max Capacity now you're right but I mean you're at the max I don't know if it's double zero wire not that you're using for underground but what I'm saying you can't go anymore where if they had a string more wire up top you could always hang it yeah right you can always hang yeah the solution of that is actually doing a loop and that way you have a continuous feed from from both sides I understand it but still you're limited on power right now on how much you can draw and that's and what I just can't see put 300 million cars on the grid in the United States for me the undergroundiness for reliability right and so we we get a small wind blow and everyone on the street would was out of power so for each of your neighborhoods pay attention I had them come out and do work on our poles and replace poles and we have we had no power we've had no power loss since I called them and said we've got issues you need to come do this and I called the engineer got them out there they agreed they they replaced a couple of polls re-ran some power lines and it worked and we've not had you know knock on wood power outages at all nothing through the storm we just had one a week ago but it was a wire somebody a contractor but um when we were when Irma had here we were out five days from the south end and if you talk to Duke your contractors 90 of it was because of what you just said vegetation that the homeowner didn't take care of right right well it's hard to it's hard to claim the work whenever it's directly behind two homes where they're back to back who who actually owns the property line no one does and so it rarely ever gets done yeah but when you see it start climbing up like you said you need to address it and get somebody out there and and Duke will cut it unless it's wrapped around the Transformer then they're saying oh I'm not doing that but I like what you said mayor regarding um like the work that you had done I wonder if at that time they said well our estimate's going to be five dollars so that if this would be a time if you were interested in doing the underground they would give you that five dollars towards what the cost would be to go underground in lieu of going ahead would be placing the polls I mean I have Transformers behind my house because of the Salt Air that don't look great at all so it may not be because of a power increase need but they're going to have to come out there soon and address that because it looks really bad so if they're going to spend any um a pretty decent amount of money to replace Transformers and and wires and poles and I was out in front of that a little bit and said hey we're interested in doing this undergrounding I think that would be fabulous if they said well our estimate would be this much money if you want to go underground we'll consider paying that amount to assist with that project I don't want to get too bogged down in this power conversation but what I can tell you is if you're you have a deep interest in doing undergrounding you have to get your neighbors right you have to get them to buy out right and whenever we pitch this to uh it started with the entire city we I mean it started with Bellevue uh Island Estates but um whenever we said well you know I would really like to do it for the whole city there were so many people that didn't want to pay that extra money because it's not a nice for them it runs in their backyard and no one can see it right and so you can only you you have to be very strategic about where you want to get it done and then you've really got to Lobby your neighbors for buying it's a lot of money for a long time so all right what's next so you're asking for us to to do we want to discuss this now are we going to move on and deal with this at another Workshop or what are we doing on this well I know that that it took several several meetings to get this dialed in to where where it is now and uh and I do see there's a lot of a lot of items here that we've resolved yeah I will say that uh this Council and the prior Council we actually got quite a bit done and the council before that also the city's been going in the right direction and uh we still owe kudos to vice mayor Gunn because uh he did did a great job of kind of dialing the city in and giving us Focus so um my recommendation would be to start with this list that we've got in our our goals here and you know that Kyle has already knocked some of them out and is there anything new that we're working on What's Come going forward and where does it land um maybe we spent about probably maybe next 30 minutes on this everybody feel all right with that all right so Kyle the I'm looking at page 10 and this is where we start going through the list one of the things that I saw say your public safety and health one of the things that that I did not see and and I don't think that we ever actually came to a complete agreement on it we were discussing ditching the generator then we start kind of went back and and we were rehashing that trying to make up our mind on whether we were actually doing it or not um I know that we we killed it but then vice mayor Shirley brought it right back up again and we started discussing it again I did you don't remember that I remember us saying it was too expensive I just want I just wanted to make sure that I just felt it was too much I was trying to figure out what was there ever a need for it did we have we ever needed a generator and that's why I discussed it and then we just killed it you never need it until you need it well I know but the point is if there's a hurricane we vacate the building anyway right um I just I didn't see a reason to invest 300 000 into something that we've never used okay we ended that well that that that was on the list and uh that's why I brought it up working with uh Public Safety Health had somebody called in about uh looking at the waterways out here where we're getting people that are zipping by the jet skis Etc we don't have any set zones for Speed warning and I noticed that in the Pinellas workout they said that we should be at least looking at safety of voting we will monitor the speeds vessels but you know perhaps in this area that we put the the safety booze out I don't know if they're uh speed buoys or uh I think it's no wake zone already through here I mean I don't vote I just know because I come through here we have some piles um with signs on them and then some some buoys um and it's a it's the noake idle speed is with the current okay but that's relatively close to short not in the big area in the center because it's Heat uh skiers out there quite curriculum yeah that's allowed an intercoastal yeah is there any problem with manatees out in that area I know they're relatively close to shore looking to watch that but it's too hot right now well I mean but we do have yeah more collisions between boats and vanities like I said in those areas where there's no limits we've had them right we've had them hit right off of uh six 12th Street with the jet skis in fact I got two citizens that said I didn't see it but they said there was they're doing some filming right off between sixth and seventh yesterday flying in and I said you sure they weren't residents at Dollar Shores I just said no because then they took off and tried to hit the sea dumps up by 8th Street blew more out of wood and then just kept going going I think you know you're always going to have a freak out absolutely so much I think the uh for the most part the FWC is Mark the waters uh adequately uh where they where they need to there's you're always going to have one that wanders in in a strange area and gets hit by a boat but um I don't think you could regulate everything and we've got a lot of jet ski rentals I mean other than going and talking to the jet ski rental place saying you know we don't know how I'm on Bellar Beach or something like that but I don't know how you do that I mean that's those are the skiers you see out there minimum wage kids running the Jets and people who've never been used to vote uh driving a you know pretty powerful vessel like those bicycles where those little Parts they read they come through our neighborhoods all the time so there's nothing out here people well we've we've all seen what happens whenever we try to post a sign anywhere in the water so I I would prefer personally if we didn't go down this road because I don't want to have to deal with permitting and all the uh craziness that happens whenever we try this I would like to well we're talking about waterways and Public Safety I think that we still need to focus on um the boat Moorings the you know The Mooring fields that are being created out here and and they many of them are just vacant um maybe weekend people live on them I don't know and they're not pumping out they're just dumping overboard there there are some regulations but if it's not enforced and I don't know how we I know we are supposed to be monitoring and managing off of our uh property you know off of Bellaire Beach the side of the intercoastal I believe is what when this came up before we talked about and I know we don't have a boat to monitor that but you know can we Engage The Sheriff to do a little more monitoring to ask for proof of registration ask for proof of pumping out of those vessels um you know it's a it's a hazard didn't I thought Lynn because we brought this up when Lynn was still here and yeah and he cleaned up a lot of remember some of them but there's a couple of them and from what I'm seeing it where does Arc I guess our jurisdiction really because it looks like they pushed them just right to the that jurisdiction along that's what I'm saying I think it's from what Lynn told me it's this side of the intercoastal along Bel Air Beach and that's where I'm seeing that a lot of them were more or are you seeing them well we've got quite a few around these islands out here so that would and I don't know if that's us or is that ours yeah so a lot of them have moved over there from this side because they were you know in direct view I think they were getting a lot of castles from people I'm not sure but I can tell you the ones which we have no control the ones over by the boat dock the boat ramp but it's I grow through there with the boat the other night and literally there's no one on those boats they're just they're gonna end up sinking right behind the boat ramp and nothing will be done about it I'm sure they can take care of the derelict vessels that can't navigate on their own fairly quickly so if they're in a really bad condition those are the easy ones um but as far as just anchoring and not having one on them um I mean I got a whole presentation about like how they they're making every effort they can um but there's not much they can do even though we have um submerged lands out here that doesn't apply they're on top of the water so we don't own the waters um and my understanding is it doesn't make a difference how far out they are they could be right up on us and do the same thing but we still can enforce registration pump pump out you know they right we can add that to our code that if you are warned out there and you have it pumped out weekly then you need to move on you know we can you can be ticketed or find I mean there are some requirements to having a vessel you can't just like leave it those requirements exist out there and they try to enforce those I don't know if there's a way we could um you can write all the laws that's the problem we we have to wait on Pinellas County to enforce it um but if we talk to the sheriff and say hey I know we've got deputies patrolling the streets we'd like to have someone on the Waterway you know we'd like to see a schedule what the waterways looks like when is the Deputy on our waterways I've never seen him out there I've seen him oh I see them yeah there's another problem you have also is that there's limited funding to actually do anything with these boats with these boats um so let's say they they tag one and they um they have the people removed and they find them and the boats left there well where are they going to take it what do they do with it and and they're the reason why they did this one sweep was because they had funds I believe that's the way that worked they had so much funds and it cost money to Rack these things and Destroy them and discard them so whenever you saw the ones with the big orange mark on them those were the ones that the sheriff had marked as okay yeah and they did get funding to tow them away and Destroy them right and I think that only comes it's not it's not a whole lot of money it's they uh if you remember two three years ago there was just a pile of them going into Dunedin on Edgewater Road and then they finally cleaned them all up now it looks like you're starting starting to pile up again they migrate yeah uh well we can certainly add this to the list and keep it on our radar as something that uh it's always going to be a nuisance but it should always be something that we're paying attention to because New Opportunities May uh may arise where we can actually make a difference with these with these boats and it's not I mean I think the biggest issue is when they start worrying behind someone's house then we've got an issue which happened at the end of 22nd right there was a guy out there that was tied off right you know not far behind one of our resident homes so that then it becomes an issue you know and if we don't have anything in place to handle it then we're you know whatever so we just need to be aware of it before it is an issue so would that would you consider that a safety issue or would you consider it a beach and Waterfront issue which which goal do we want to put together I would say goal four vibrant well plan well maintained appearance I agree I got this thing behind the black pearls or behind my house everyone else agree with that that's mayor Shirley yeah that's fine increase scrutiny over contractor permitting I like that one of one of the things that I've noticed is that even though we look at plans and they run through the standard process we don't have a tool in place to actually find out if those plans are accurate there's we don't have anyone physically going to the property and taking a look at it you have to take the designer's plan for face value and make a decision on it is that the case that's correct um with the Pinellas County Building Services is our building department through the agreement so when they inspect they're supposed to verify um the work that's being done if any extra work has happened or so um I've had different cases where I had suspicions that there could possibly be more and I I've uh kind of mentioned something but that really is what they do um but I do understand having a large County handling it in our jurisdiction it's definitely more economical but I can see how you know their could it could get lost on some of the details that's why I try to if I do see anything that um stands out as possibly extra work or something different being done I try to flag them on it but I know what you're saying is it possible that uh maybe maybe our code enforcement could check uh Deering Construction something like that there should be some way that we could at least raise a red flag if we suspected that there was an issue with a permit that's incorrect or not being built the way that they it was presented oh I think Steve uh Deputy Steve galapka does you know monitor what is occurring and does check in with our office on what permits are actually being held um and then really what what's being done inside the house that's all on the county um because what we can't see we right we can't enforce um to really do it nobody's trained Architects engineer they one of our drive-by guys cannot assess that legally I mean you can't say oh you're load-bearing walls here so the city's mainly looking at the um the zoning and the the flood plain code um I think a lot of my attention gets directed to make sure people are following the the remodeling rules um and not doing anything more because that's a this industry people want to flip houses make money management rules so if you go ahead Mr Roberts I was just going to say from my experience you know once a permit is already applied for and given to you and the county is involved they do a very good job of making sure the work's being done according to the permit requirements so the only issue would be that where I think our Deputy would come into play would be if somebody did not put in for a permit and he does a good job of catching those people but once once there is a permit I've had two or three I had some gas lines put in and the counties all over it to make sure it's done right well I'm going to share a story about someone that I know that had some Doc work done and I had to plan it all looked good it was approved by the city it was approved by the county uh the the doc company came out and they built according to the plan uh but what they didn't do is they didn't take the the pie shape angle into consideration and they treated the guy's property as a straight a square piece of land so he thought he was going to have this nice Dock and boat lift and come to find out after the dock was built he was only going to have a foot between his lift and his in the neighboring property line so he had to he couldn't build his boat left because they completely got it wrong and I think that if someone had actually seen the property and I don't know it just seems like was the boat list shown on the original yes permit yes it was um I I think that just somehow or another it there's a there's something missing in our way that that we're issuing permits and uh giving approval and it's it's way more than you should have to do but that's that's really weird because the tax partial we have the visual aspects today I mean an engineer should pick that up you know what I'm saying like that this isn't a rectangular Square property it is if you're a good engineer and you're paying attention but if you're not a good engineer or you're just right so are you saying that the where the property lines projected correctly in the permit application um and they built it wrong I I think the way that they drew the plan up it looked like the property line went 90 degrees out from the land but the truth is is it was like this and so you would run right into it and uh and so he didn't he didn't get to build his boat lift because there was a problem he just halted the project said I'm not going to change anything because I'm at least within the 12 foot setback but you know as well as I do a boat lift is 12 feet wide and so if he had put that in there it would have been a foot away from his neighbor's property and my point is is that this poor guy thought he was doing everything right he called a reputable company they drew up the plans it went through the entire system and whenever it was time to install the metal structure for the you know the beams and the boat lift he couldn't do it because he realized uh oh I am this is going to be way too close so that's kind of I think I guess yeah the engineering aspect of it and like what I've seen um in this past year is a lot of Architects and Engineers submitting drawings that aren't well done and then trying to have the city engineer work through the the the errors and the drawings which really isn't what their purpose yeah so yeah I think and that's what I was going to say is I know that we were having trouble with um not meeting setbacks things like that the plans were sent to the county the county would approve you know some basic errors were on there so now we have an engineer reviewing the site plan for before they go to the county and that's been a huge help I mean that's helped eliminate a lot of the problems is he looking at the doc plans too probably not right maybe we should get ourselves we're looking at the doc plans and and we're looking at the projections of the property lines yeah um but but you're only as good as as those drawings are right yeah but if the problems drawing was completely wrong so that kind of fall that falls back on the company and the engineer um because you know in a lot of plans that they build it differently than what they say um then it just becomes a violation of our code so I mean I'm dealing with some now where you know like like a um either with the impervious ratio sometimes they give you one plan but they put in more or or the elevations of what they say are different right well and I think the the challenge you're facing too is you're looking to create policy around anecdotal instances which are which are difficult to regulate towards it that those events certainly happen um are not necessarily indicative of a systemic issue and you guys are looking at strategic plans and systemic visioning and policy making which I think is a little harder to say Nitty Gritty we're going to change everything because this one thing happened which could have just been an anomaly in the process yeah I wouldn't necessarily say it's an anomaly I would say that this one was caught right but I if I had to guess that there's plenty of people that are stretching stretching their permit to uh to make it work and I guess if if we're not the ones inspecting it and it goes to the county and they approve it is it on the county for approving it or is it back on us for not well it's on us for reviewing what they submit um not that it gets changed then I'd say that the county is the one that's inspecting it at that point the site issue and I'll just be very brief because I know this is we're talking about code stuff we probably shouldn't be discussing right now but but that's I think I've always said we need to be inspecting these site these sites as they're being built even though we're not given them official construction inspection but because of just that you get a loose landscape plan and before you know it the entire yard is paved is is concrete or something which was not what they submitted but they pushed the limits and you know I've shared with you a couple of my neighbors they've they've gone in and put concrete down both sides their entire backyard is concrete and you know that's not allowable no that's not and in the case of a new construction um I'm looking at that when we do the CL inspection so I'm measuring the step back I'm measuring the the pervious surface um I try to pay attention to those things as they're getting work through um but if what they do vary it's from the plan that's kind of on them you know rather than us being out there policing it every second but I think it's important that we look at the major things I don't think we were doing that at one time so it's improving as we go is my point and we're changing some things that is helpful and we're constantly watching the Landscaping because the no permit is required for landscaping so we do have a lot of code that covers where things can and can't be yeah we're trying to say I'm not all right I'll uh I'll move on on that one but uh just to confirm um Bayside gazebo I see it's it's on this list and I know that these are things you flagged are did we have any plans for doing this that's one thing I saw on there and then it never kind of made it over to the objectives list uh I never heard a uh 100 yes or 100 no so it's kind of still on the table in my mind it's not in the budget we've not we've not really discussed it um it would fall under the Bayside Park we do have money in Bayside Park Improvement and um we did when we did do the playground replacement we moved that money to make sure that it was compensated for in the last year's budget okay anyone else like to make comments on uh goal number one so was that a is the Bayside gazebo going to be scratched or is that something we'll still leave for discussion it's still on the list as a goal but I don't but we haven't officially approved it I wonder if we've ever asked uh you're talking right out here right is have we ever asked the partners that do use this place would you like to see a gazebo or would you have used a gazebo if offered that we have some actual data to work off of if they're coming back no no no and then okay scratch it but if they're coming back yeah with a paid X right yeah when we can do that I mean Laura can easily survey people who runs this facility and get their opinion as they come through or or more importantly maybe the parks committee yeah yeah I like the way you delegate so you're saying all the residents as a whole versus the um the renters because most of our renters are actually non-residents right but the parks will do this Parks will tell us would it be helpful for them to have it out there for events or okay would residents use it that type of thing um you know when they do the concert in the park I think it might be a nice thing because it's pretty sunny out I don't know we have data and you have some plans you can share with them that you know show a beautiful drawing of it and maybe it's not that but it's something similar to only uh 12th Street uh crosswalk traffic Island situation we've we've kind of beat this one uh to death I mean is is there anything to monitor I mean we we have considered dropping it we've considered keeping it we've and then we finally decided yes we have to have it because people can't get out without it um but does it still belong on this list I I don't know if we in my mind we've reached that point because the last I recall is that we're having the county kind of re-study the whole situation and again I'm gonna take that data and that's still being reviewed yeah anything else you'd like to add to goal number one Council so the expedite walking trail Taping that already got mixed right yeah that was yes that's gone the playground's done yeah well tabooy decisions done but I think we keep that Beach swimmer safety on there right because it's always going to be it's always going to be there that's one of the things that uh regular maintenance they break off and eternal vigilance yes all right you know this I'm sorry the city the city-wide lighting I've gotten kind of a varied response from citizens I've talked to I thought everybody would be in favor of more and better Lighting on the street and uh that's not what I've seen I've seen maybe 50 of the people saying yeah I'd like more lighting and I've had 50 of the people saying I don't want any more lighting I don't even like the lighting it's there on the street they'd rather it be pretty dim and dark going down the street so that was interesting I I kind of thought people would want more lighting but it didn't seem like that was the case in my case I wanted more lighting but I didn't want it in my front yard right which seems to be the norm yeah that seems to be the norm right it was uh it was a difficult situation uh whenever they were doing uh solar lighting on a Hillview Island Estates because there was a lot of negotiating with the neighbors and trying to find uh safe spots but I think for the most part once it was finished everyone just said well I've got one now or I don't and they were pretty happy with the way that it turned out and the light fixtures do look nice oh yeah the like the street lights at about yeah eight foot high so nobody gets them to just go down on the ground and they have more directional type street lights you can get so that it I mean well if you see dark spots on your street and you think you need a street light talk to Kyle talk to Duke and just at minimum get a street light to light Corners you know and we worked with the Shields and the um you know the dimming settings on the lights depending on who is around it the first go around there they go a lot brighter than they are right now well that also addresses the modernized lighting that on page 14 as well too yeah we're on gold too yeah right deliver the best value for the taxpayer dollar prioritize and managed based on targeted outcomes uh why why is dollar in blue just curious was that was that a Glenn gun emphasis it's not on ours really okay I would check that out there I highlighted it okay uh let's see best value Focus effective efficient sustainable resilient refine the budget process Capital planning contracts City Investments I think we're doing all of that already continue to invest in our human resources and City staff well we did that with Kyle and you also did the uh the reviews of the just job descriptions I know yours was done but anybody else we need our last job description review was 2019. we just did the Personnel policies an employee handbook and that's uh being reviewed right now by legal and we uh annually review compensation um I know that there is some training and development going on I think that for the most part we're doing pretty well with these human resources and City staff but I'd like to get the city manager's opinion on that I believe we're doing we're doing well like I said we just we're updating our personal policies um I have some uh proposals in the budget on how to best use staff and um which I'll get to at a later meeting but um that dealing with the administrative assistant we've had that as a as a position on there we've had haven't been able we filled it temporarily for about three weeks um it just didn't didn't last a little bit more um I guess uh hours in the front office to assist with the the clerical stuff so so that was for a part-time position right that was a part-time part-time yes and I believe when we talked about uh last budget cycle when we agreed to lower the hours of Code Enforcement I think that's worked out well that we're still enforcing code effectively um and that that is a price it's a high price tag um to have the Sheriff's Office do it so that's something to kind of weigh out I think with staff as well not saying get rid of one or the other at this point but definitely think about maybe future adjustments and we're talking about weekends um no I'm just talking about um the contractual hours with the Pinellas County Sheriff to do code enforcement versus um more hours of just generous and how we can letting our staff accomplish what we need to do are we getting the training and development for the staff as needed I mean do you see opportunity to do anything more with them um I think we're doing fairly well I mean we just started Aaron in community services um he'll be doing uh you know the public works okay development and things like that um and there's some training available so you can send them outsourced there's a there's well they do classes like like conferences classes um um I can look into a more formalized certification you can train them but there's probably some opportunity for them to do a certification program that would be helpful and free up your time you don't need to sure do everything um currently I think Patty's pretty well caught up in her position and um I think we have an ongoing safety program we're always doing our training in-house with our Public Works staff and then as far as code enforcement I think you know if uh there is training for that um and certifications just um to to better understand the process depending on how we move on that we're still doing code enforcement on the weekends we are Steve varies his schedule it's usually a Saturday or Sunday and they might have a weekend off he tries to uh you know mix it up I know the best he can but in-house we don't do anything on the weekends right right now we're not doing anything in-house on the weekend side that could be arranged so it looks like we've got that area covered pretty well you're doing a great job and uh just keep keep moving forward with the uh training and opportunities to learn so that's cool a couple quick questions um so Kyle if that part-time admin position was a full-time admin position is that a position that you could keep busy if it was full-time because apparently I'm hearing it's difficult to find somebody part-time with the skill sets that you need yeah if it was a full-time person working that particular position I know you guys wear a lot of different hats would you be able to keep that person um doing things that the city needs and what I would do is get them more involved with the code enforcement and a lot of a lot of the things that are done in the office as well that do code enforcement Because Of You the sheriff's deputy does the field work but there's still a lot of that work is done with all the notices and the hearing dates and then the coordination finds um invoicing sure so there's a lot of work inside that gets done with code enforcement what would we have to do in order to do we have the money in the budget to go ahead and advertise for a full-time admin as opposed to a part-time can we move some funding around or is it already as of now at this date we could um we could advertise and be able to we have enough money in the budget to compensate someone for around a year okay um because we haven't had that position filled all it was just under a month well would that impinge upon other requirements like you know storm all the needed work um I don't think it would impinge on it I think that being such a small City and we're all kind of like hybrid staff where we do a lot of different things and also you've got to double load it I mean you have to sell where everybody thinks salary but that's full time now health benefits welfare revision everything so that's kind of it is sort of a big big chunk there yeah and you can put it in the budget to look at it and that's that's all on some consideration um you know moving like I said the like the contractual employee with the with the sheriff those hours are very expensive um but yeah when you have full time you have the benefits that are included but um part of the problem with being able to fill that position I think is just um if you offered that full-time with a little and more incentive another thing I'm thinking about is um I can't say exactly when but we do have there's going to be staff turnover um due to retirements in the future and I think it's important to try to get somebody in the office maybe that's what's going to work a lot a little ways into the future is younger um to kind of start learning the ropes to make a transition um so again I can't say for certain but it would be possible I mean you're looking at you know hey okay fine let's put this forward as a budget proposal but along with the time phase I mean your best shot at okay here's my employers here's their really their range of you know Sundown so I kind of know how I'm facing these employees out how many faces of these employees and that might help us to get a better handle and go okay our needs will be met for a longer period of time with a more Optimum selection of resource meaning you have a full-time person but you're balancing it perhaps with less hours on a contract basis with you know the person to point out to review code because you sell a lot of it's the back end paperwork so we can you know move some resources around but we need something to Resource loading right and then again with the with the staff turnover planning and you know it's just I have a feel for it but it's not a it's not an exact thing because you know life changes all the time and it's a broad idea what sounds like you answered my question Kyle which was if we had a full-time person in there you would have plenty for them to do and a lot of good reasons in addition to that to have that person hopefully be able to fold into a position down the road due to some potential retirements and things like that yeah and I hope the city manager realizes that we're not trying to manage his Personnel but yeah I do it you certainly uh if you determine that you need extra resources or um a budget increase for whatever uh it's it's your domain and you just make the recommendation and give us some numbers and we'll take a look at it and take a vote on it perfect okay and I have heard some feedback from people that have just unsolicited talked to me about and I don't know what our goals are about answering calls at City Hall um I've had people talk to me about nobody ever answers the phone and maybe that's maybe that we don't want to do that maybe you wanted to go to voicemail I'm not sure but it's the automated response all the time I think it would be great if we had somebody enough staff there so that it does get answered every time it just gives you a better feeling you know as a citizen somebody picks up the phone said hi may help you type of the thing although when I do leave a message because it's happened to me before you guys always get back I'm sure you get back quicker to me than most because you know I'm important and stuff like that but but uh but uh yeah I just think if that person was full-time and that person would also be taking on more of a responsibility of of addressing of citizens coming to the front as well as answering the phone I think that's huge all right I'm gonna ask that we move on okay all right uh so uh we've got obviously the human resources aspect covered and it's something that will continue to be one of our goals we focus on the update job descriptions uh evaluations compensation training and development we've discussed that that will stay on uh continue to optimize CIP evaluate effective on reserve burn rate and I think we've done a pretty darn good job of that also we're finding creative ways to fund our projects and uh get things done and not go into the red any comments on that one vice mayor Shirley okay so that one definitely needs to stay on engage citizen advisory committee we do that every opportunity we can which is awesome and we are truly grateful for them because we would be buried if we had to do everything that the citizen advisory committee does on top of our regular positions uh let's see maximize return on investment City Hall Marina Marina parking lot I think we're doing a great job with that also yeah Kyle do you have any comments I think over the years recent years we've really there's a lot of rentals between weddings and and events that this so we're definitely maximizing the Space Engineering screen um you know obviously uh we're discussing the marina tonight so it's uh that's one of those things that we're uh always focused on leverage grants special assessments uh it's nice to get grants um and uh we're definitely taking advantage of the special assessments um something that should just always be on the radar of looking for Creative funding develop a grant policy best practice that's on tonight's agenda also great with all capital projects and budget processes yes I think we've any opportunity we get to take care of these capital projects uh with grants special assessments um we should I mean it's just a given the the whole goal number two is is pretty much yeah you better be doing this yeah right keep it in place right whoever's technology especially in Communications I think we've done a pretty good job there and we continue to uh foreign can I just interrupt real quick and it's completely off okay I probably shouldn't it's getting into the weeds again but speaking of communication I had someone say and it was a resident would not rent this facility for their wedding because of those TVs didn't fold up and that and there's nothing you can do about making them go away when you're trying to make this a nice Event Hall so just and I know that they do sell brackets that flip up so we might at some point look at doing something like that but just because it came to my mind I wanted to have to relocate them flip them up um yeah they fold right up against the ceiling and then they can drape the ceiling but as they are that low you can't drape the ceiling I'd probably just load a visual on it you know like a you know happy wedding yeah put the bride in the groom up there someone that lived on here is not using it for her daughter's wedding for that one reason just an FYI and the final item on this is a budget process based on strategic goals and objectives that's something that we'll be doing this time and we do this every year and it is 7 30 which means it's time to take a five minute break okay [Music] all right now we're back from our break and we are moving on to goal number two page two which is integrate rescue funds into the budget reallocate stormwater funds for Gulf Boulevard what's the UG stand for underground Underground and other cips so we uh that's fine still that's in progress right now so it's still on our uh on our goal list mitigate emergency generator acquisition with FEMA Grant well that didn't happen that one needs to be pulled off that's interesting that it's on goal one angle too because I think we have seen the goal too with the tax dollar value instead of self-funding right yes okay foreign program with local schools I.T and website admin Financial Services I don't think we're doing anything with that is this something that's should be one of our goals or is this was this something uh it seemed like a good idea at the time I think it was like an idea for someone helping with the administration of Zoom um I mean it's always something we could pursue I don't know if we're going to find it I can say that I have an intern right now at work but okay what what that the intern is doing uh is a highly specialized skill and not somebody just uh run our Zoom meetings can anyone think of a reason why we would have this I don't think a reason because frankly that's the city manager you know when you need Manpower you direct if Hal when I think the only question would be is are there any schools that have um well I mean community colleges whatever that have a city government type program that we could actually or helping someone where it's not self-serving right we're helping build more as you say you may have people retiring if you're uh if we're bringing interns through a program that could help our city and you could eventually bring on employees or have that pool of people available but I don't know if there's you know we're not we're not near Tallahassee where there's like you know I don't know so that you know SPC has a public policy and they do that that's their last their Keystone project is all working with the city government in a specific project if they move it they've run it the problem with their interns is that you have to have the Personnel to train that intern that's where we run into issues that is that our staff doesn't have time uh to and to be the Handler of an intern um the the intern that I have right now takes up a lot of my time and uh you know I'm enjoying it but at the same time um is it is there any benefit to anyone other than the intern and the question or the answer is there's no it's there's not uh so if we have those types of resources I'm all for it but otherwise I would be against bringing in an intern I would say we removed that I don't think we're big enough yeah I was thinking along the lines of what you know with the like Bright Futures if we could just get a straight up volunteer that's not too technical but just needs hours right you know but again you need to manage that right so you have to talk to whoever with the school you've got to have a volunteer manage you know unless Parks was managing that for you or something like that but you have to have someone manage those volunteers and I still think that there's someone here that I mean that there's not a lot of benefit to showing someone how to run a zoom meeting but I bet that there's Volunteers in this community that would step right up and help us out and that's nominal training and you're not having to get out of your seat every time and start and stop it and um and it would be their their voluntary position uh so instead of that do we just maybe have a goal of trying to find volunteers instead of having this community volunteers yeah yeah good idea good anything else uh that this Council would like to add to goal number two well I think I I know that Kyle's you know on the grant um program so should we just put that on here should we add that as the grant program yeah uh well leverage grants special assessments developer grant program it's on the page before that okay okay so leave it alone okay just trying to think dollar value what else you're looking for all right last uh opportunity to add something uh to tax dollar value all right now we're on the goal number three um and I think after we wrap up goal number three let's pause this one and because we've got quite a few pages uh and then we'll move on to the next discussion item and then we'll resume this this discussion in fact because there's several pages to goal number three maybe we uh let's see here one two try to stop now let's uh at least cover the first uh first page and then we'll take a pause and then we'll pick back up at our next work session all right so uh Toms and Community gold three credible timely and transparent information and feedback between the city and residents and gender pride of ownership inclusion and civility I wonder where that came from so uh first the first item in that goal is Foster Code Compliance versus enforcement educate and Communications so uh and I think that that's going on right now I think that uh Deputy clapka does a good job of uh trying to educate and not just smack people for doing the wrong thing but uh how do you feel um that's a ongoing battle with having a a uniformed officer I think it can kind of come across threatening I've been I've been working in a lot of different scenarios where uh just trying to have an approach of uh not too harsh of enforcement unless necessary um initial communication friendly and and with the goal to achieve compliance of where it needs to be and come across to uh to um some aggressive I guess I'd say so um yeah that's ongoing um but I think as coming from inside the city and our approach on Code Enforcement that's always our approach is to to the the goal is to get the problem solved um and you know different situations call for a different uh uh understanding and working with the resident but um yeah I think we're doing a pretty good job would you say that uh Deputy klapka has improved uh in the in the way that he handles these situations yeah as I think we've um sort of tailored um what how he approaches uh each situation based on what the what Bellaire Beach is uh focused on what's important um because we all know there's like there's different laws and codes that you can always you could enforce in every situation or um there could be you know identifying one thing that's very important about our beach like the fact that you need a permit to do say work [Music] um as opposed to you also notice that there's no not the appropriate uh signage on the vehicle which is a state statute but um I've been trying to direct them more into what what's important for our community versus you know enforcing every everything that's possible to enforce and there's certainly a different attitude that goes along with um let's say erecting a second story without a permit versus your Hedges being too high so there's certain times where I appreciate his firmness especially with contractors and illegal uh you know any type of of construction work that's being done illegally that's very important okay well I I think we've covered that just that one should always be that that attitude I like the line in there just it basically reflects that hey we're thinking of our community not only from a safety and enforcement standpoint but also that we want to make sure that you understand how to do it right right modernized lighting um we've already discussed this and I believe it was item one or goal one but this um is something we're not really doing much with at this moment but it is something I think that we should keep on our radar as budget allows for I I've continued to work through options with Duke Energy um so I do have some information on which we get feel like we get to that point that we want to start considering what our options are but I have been in communication with Duke and the solar lighting companies um just understanding what we can do and you know kind of what what the minimum we can do and then what might be like our our Dream idea of what we could do to to the lighting now for the areas where there's poor lighting but the electricity runs behind the home you know between the the backs of two homes are we just automatically looking at solar or are we are we con whenever you're taking your your evaluating our options are you considering undergrounding to where the polls should be being considered too there's pros and cons in different it depends on the street um there's some areas where um if you replace the pole you're probably going to put it in a different location there's um there's areas where when you're talking about undergrounding that does involve getting easements so there's a little extra leg work if you're going to go that route the nice thing about solar is that you can pretty much play some wherever you need to place them um there's another thing that came up with um the lighting arms that Duke Energy provides have a little bit more reach to them so that's beneficial on the county maintained Road like Gulf Boulevard where that's not as uh important when you're in the neighborhoods you know um so yeah it's kind of something um depending on where we're trying to uh upgrade where it just kind of needs to consider the pros and cons of of what is available out there another thing that came up on Gulf Boulevard is the uh um the consideration for Turtles um Duke Energy is now doing Amber lighting which is um uh certified by the FWC and you know to people in the community that's a concern if you're going to upgrade your lighting they want it can be environmentally friendly okay all right as long as we I I think I believe the council would agree with me that as long as we have uh maybe a a game plan what what I'd like to see is I'd like to see where are the darkest areas in Bel Air Beach where do we need it most and and some sort of a schedule eventually to where okay we're we're budgeting X number of dollars per year for Street lighting and here's the order that we're doing it uh to because there are some streets out there that are just dark I the United Street always comes down it's three days the worst Street and uh I hope that that's going to be resolved um when you ask for the lighting studies I tend to find that they give you the layout of what optimal lighting is I might be able to work with the Duke Engineers to find out the dark spots Mark focus on that because usually they hand it okay this is what you need or what you should have um but it doesn't really it shows you that all the additional lights and I guess you could do it in reverse of counting where more lights are installed given in the darkest areas but it obviously this is a later conversation but I just wanted to make sure that we if we're going to keep this uh in our strategic plan we're actually uh making a commitment to do so definitely we've been um funding and I'd want to kind of come up with some ideas of where what direction we're going to move in all right and that that leads me to the net did you have something so when Duke does that is that a costing do they charge us for that good so that's great yeah I've been trying to utilize it as much perfect for you so they can actually do I agree with the mayor that if we actually have a city-wide plan that do could do for us and we could and there may be issues like uh you just brought up earlier if one street said Well we'd like to have lights like they have on this other street but it may not be possible because of the power options available on your street versus over here that type of thing but I think I think it's key if we have a city-wide plan so that people can see that and understand what the um what the plan is for the street lights on their street and maybe we could get feedback from them to say well I don't we don't want or maybe they you know we're not even going to ask them if you want them because for safety reasons we feel like this is the plan and we need to put those three lights in and we're going to do our very best to make sure that they're not aggressive lighting to where it's shining in your bedroom window type of a thing yeah I think even City staff could analyze what our current placement of lights are throughout the city and we could we could almost establish where the best lit streets are by you know light per so many feet and then we're the worst place and then if we could establish a standard we're trying to meet perfect based on where we're at and then work towards it right and uh thoroughly evaluate solar options at Grant um I'm not sure about the grants but I know that you've been looking at the the various options and whenever you look at the solar lighting are you using a Bellevue Island Estates uh for a case study or anything I used as far as the maintenance since we've installed them um definitely as a case study and recently I've now that we've kind of worked out the Kinks because we did have some battery Replacements we had to do um there was some programming issues um it's been a good run I would say in like in almost the last year straight um because we had a lot of issues on Aleta and that was mainly because the settings were off so they they depleted the batteries um causing our staff to do Replacements which they're good with sending us new ones and getting them replaced but I think our staff has gotten very good at maintaining those and what we do is we try to work them in the maintenance as we have the lifts for other purposes okay definitely and that proves that yeah we're still looking into things um how how's it been going with Grant um I was going to cover that more in the in the admin policy I drafted um but I can let you give you an update I'm currently um working on trying to get something for the uh undergrounding project I uh I passed it through the the County's LMS working group and we were ranked number three on the list so if we can qualify for funding it's there we're right you know because the LMS determines what the order of the project so we got ranked High along with the with the county um problem is that benefit the cost ratio is meeting that standard and the uh the grant it's a hazard mitigation grant for uh hurricane um Ian so the money's there um right now um I've scheduled they do a consultation to assistance with working through this cost ratio I've been bouncing around a lot of different ideas of how to uh show the cost savings for the price of the project and that's that's that's our greatest battle that we faced in Bellaire Beach um is kind of reaching meeting that with the low residents and the cost of some of the projects and um there's some other issues when it comes to Grants the when it comes to storm Waters the whole uh now tied into a regional system um and then there's obviously a social economic Factor where you can have lower requirements um based on being able to prove demographics the classic portal Bel Air Beach syndrome I understand well we'll keep them on the uh we'll keep them on our goal last until they're done I I think that uh once we get past all of the storm water projects that that'll be a big Focus for the city um at least I'm hoping so all right uh expand Marina parking lot utilization and revital uh I read that wrong expand Marina parking lot utilization you know like here's an idea I was thinking about this maybe later but looking at the sand stations here whenever we had a hurricane we have a situation where we one clogged up the street with traffic and if there's any rain that tends to clog up the drainage here but it's an industrial type activity loading sandbags where we could just move those over to the parking uh in the marina parking which was often the site like restore what are you talking about well this is actually expand the marina parking lot utilization no I'm talking you're talking about moving something sorry okay all right I should have preface that yeah moving the sandbag stations to the marina parking lot because we have more room for traffic they can come in one side go out the other and it's an industrial type area for an industrial type use if we move those uh bins from here then it goes back to being a park with additional parking and it eliminates that that traffic tie up for the residents of the street well putting the sandbagging down in the Marine that's an evacuation route plus there's an island right there you really want to clog up an artery for evacuation for sandbagging because people trying to get in and coming out up here that's 9th Street that's one little Street recall and and the oh I've been here nine years and I've worked that sandbag place for nine years and I've only ever seen it clogged up once and that was just past Ian storm that everybody thought and thank you ward for not hitting us um okay so hold on a minute why don't we do this I think that if this is something you'd like us to seriously consider add it to the work session agenda the next meeting and then we'll we'll flush that out so we don't get in the Weeds on this uh a conversation you guys are both okay with that okay all right uh so uh there was add engine flushing station I agree you can remove it who put that in okay put that in looking at you know almost turning that into a full Marina but I I didn't know there was really not a use for it well actually there'd be plenty of use for it but do we want to maintain it and do we want to have it monitored and all that especially whenever the city of Clearwater was so gracious to provide us with uh two of them across the intercoastal and then one or maybe two of them also at the uh the gas station so yeah I would I would like to remove that one so everyone else agree yes not to mention the one at the causeway which almost caused the gun fight which they then did remove them they had two nice ones down there but you guys can't have nice things anymore yeah it was it's a shame foreign minimize above ground utilities we've discussed is quite a bit tonight we know that if if we had our way we'd probably do it everywhere but you uh we also know that it's something that requires a lot of effort for individual neighborhoods but it's something we'll always talk about and consider do we want to leave it on here okay yeah yeah all right uh mature manicured foliage and vegetation yeah we've we're that one's a given uh develop a city-wide maintenance program we have that we did that in a year one of the plan of those strategic plan so should we change it from develop to maintain thank you foreign asset inventory to include City staff we have that don't we we have an asset inventory but so they want to I'm not sure where this is going they want to have staff included in some way I I don't I don't know where that came from sure Council just one of the vice Mayors I guess to include City staff and I mean it's complete now do we even need this on here it's complete what does this last one really mean I don't understand it about breaking out a walking amusements it was along the lines of when we were doing the street repaving that we would do the sections of the walking experience that Doug and that's coming up yeah yeah that's gone right I think we should have remain in their maintaining which that could be brought up into your maintenance program but make sure that walking easement is maintained because you repeat that vice mayor yeah I said um the uh walking easement should be part of the maintenance program and just add that as part of that maintenance program to make sure what the rest of it can go away right yeah I'd agree with that and a lot of the maintenance with The Walking easement um it's encroached on by the uh all right is everyone uh okay with taking a break from this when and continuing it at the next work session yes yes so we're stopping at page 15 that's where we'll continue all right let's move on to item number three Marina rental prop policies and uh it says I placed this on the agenda this is something that I actually worked on with city manager but the city manager is actually uh I think he should present this sure so uh we went over the existing slips that we have available for rent um they're numbered 1 through 19 but really uh slip one is unusable um it hasn't been used in a while so um part of this uh first page here is uh a renumbering reassigning of the slips and then uh based on the sizes of the slips we did some comparisons of um how they how they group together and the idea is to classify different size slips a b and c um and you can see that um Class A would be the largest uh slips in those old range I don't have the exact they're based on the with the beam width slip but the idea is that those larger slips that could accommodate longer boats wider boats that you designate those slips for boat lengths of 30 to 40 feet um and then the next class down will be a Class B and that would be for boats 24 to 34 feet and the smallest slips would be a Class C and they would be for boats 20 to 28 feet and the purpose of this is to um maximize the available space in the marina to try to again provide it for residents but to get to make sure we're not sticking a 20-foot boat in the biggest slip that we have but I thought the uh we were looking at this and the residents should have that ability to make the decision if they're willing to pay that amount they don't have to have the boat that matches at they can stick their kayak in there if they are on the list and they're willing to pay it put them in there I don't want to force a resident to buy a two million dollar boat just to have the ability to put in a Marina and I think that's what we're trying to head for that's why I was kind of shocked I saw the numbers but I don't see a plan and that's what we're going to look at the uh how you rank people perhaps re-ranking what we already have out there and providing The Residency ability to purchase a slip regardless of their boat you mind if I pick and see what he's saying so so what we did was we came up with a b and c pick one okay and that's where you get in line for and um so now if any one of the let's just say you pick a and any one of those slips comes available and you're the next person in line whether you have a boat or not then you you can get that slip however by you selecting a then you are committing that you are going to have no more or no less than I'm sorry no less than 30 feet no more than 40 feet we also provide you with the option to go shopping and find a boat but during the six months that you're looking for a boat and you don't until you have a boat we even work with you to where you can you'll get a 36 foot rate so you're you're in the middle of the road but I absolutely disagree with allowing somebody to put a kayak and a 17 foot wide slip if they're paying the rent yeah I'm agreement with him if you're paying the bills yeah your call yeah well just because I may not be able to afford it lost in the stock market this whole thing came up because the resident got over exactly if you look yeah there are slips that are very narrow and there are slips that are very wide okay well it makes no sense at all to rent a uh a small uh I'm sorry a large very wide slip to somebody with a very narrow boat now if they were to do that what would you do you'd say okay well you're charged the uh 30 feet and you're also present preventing someone else who might want a bigger boat uh from getting in there I think it's it's perfectly fair if you look at the number of C's and the number of bees and the number of a is it's pretty well divided up so you've got various um various sizes of boats that we can accommodate so you'd only be locked in you have to call out I want slip a and there's a separate list for slippies separate list releases I agree I don't agree either yeah are we going to tell people how many TVs they have to put in their house because what you're proposing is I'd like you to call any Marina around here and say I want your biggest slip for my 18-foot boat and they say your check good they're what they're going to say is absolutely not I think that is a challenge I probably don't know I think if that slip is open and they're looking for money they'll take it yeah they're not I'm not saying we should reduce the price I mean do you kick that person out if they lose the boat if it's been surveyed well actually if they lost their boat they would have six months to put another boat into the same slip and what creates a image that um we're not making those slips available to you know because you'd have to explain if there's a slip with a kayak tied up in it yeah sick for six months and you're waiting to put your boat in you walk up and you don't really see a boat in that slip it does create the appearance that the city's not servicing the residence it really does well here you're saying that's what you did because you have six months to upgrade I can put that little five foot boat in there as long as within six months I buy the big launcher so somebody's still going to come up to you and say well what's up well show them the receipt yeah I mean we're gonna have some yeah there's gonna be some disagreement here obviously yeah I'll look at it so I misunderstood you were saying after the six months you'll have to meet the requirement as long as I could yeah I could park that five foot I could park that kayak there because I got six months from that day I park it I'm paying the full run to pull in that NASA vote now what happens if it's a construction delay that my brand new teak wood is not available so I still got another six months oh okay so let let's just yeah we're getting into the weeds but let's go along with what you're saying for the moment all right um if you look at the next page you're going to see that there's uh proposed rates That Vary based upon width again width of the slip so they're not all the same right all right so um I've got this right Kyle help me out here because I'm struggling to see this all right okay it's nine dollars for a sleet uh C types yes the smallest slips are nine dollars for a resident um these are just uh numbers I plugged in took it as roughly to the same um slip Revenue okay you know just playing around with some numbers um but so I just I separated them out by the class class A is the largest it's eleven dollars a foot for the resident um Class B's the medium to ten dollars as classy is nine and then there's a non-resident fee um that again is just kind of a number that's gonna be roughly you know it could change but I just picked something so we can see all the numbers work um I put it at the top uh where it says current Revenue that um is with our 2023 um adjusted fees that is our well technically we just lost a boat on uh slip 16 which is it makes an available slip um which is ironically the largest slip we have so I think we need to make a careful decision on how we um open this slip up but I plug the numbers in based on what we had previous so this boat leaving slip 16. so um just to kind of show some things um the idea is uh if you don't have about um but you're holding a slip that's what that no vote number is um I just wanted to show what the numbers would be if there were no boats but we were just going on the the rate um but that would be um but I think the actual most important um if you if we were to use this uh fee structure for what is in there right now um we'd be making uh significantly more uh Revenue about ten thousand dollars a year or more yearly but I think you need to take into account that the goals or ultimately we we have all residents in those slips so at first we might have higher Revenue but over time we're going to see that Revenue go down because our goal is to have uh the marina completely used by residents so then that last section there is the current boat lengths using this fee structure um you know and they're all residents so you do see that the revenue does go down because um you're not having any of those non-resident fees but it's kind of keeping it in the ballpark I thought um you know it's about six seven thousand dollars difference I thought that was close enough um playing with the numbers but that's just what I laid out so what are we doing about the initial problem what about that list and making it fair to all citizens so the kernelis um it was like it was the largest slip I I started at what our current policy was we got down um it went down five um weightless enrollees and um and um it ended up getting to the fifth person that was um down there for a 32 foot length boat but currently has a 28 foot length so I put it on hold based on the fact that they're willing to pay the um the 32 foot length fee for that slip even for six months um but they only plan on putting a 28-foot boat in there so that kind of comes down to the uh decision of how we want to do this and being this our largest slip I just stopped right there because I thought once we got into the 28 you know 20 something Footers were looking at giving our larger slip to a smaller boat so I kind of wanted some direction on where we're going it tells me it's like what did you tell the other four people that were in that list ahead of it they passed it up so they they were informed you had the ability you can do it okay so as long as they're totally informed of that questions if I'm looking at the new rates versus the current mix we only have one person paying nine dollars a foot why would we drop the rates for everyone else everyone else is the the then it goes to 10 and 11 but two three because again we were just trying to structure out the fees differently but not focus on each individual's change in rental and this is just proposed so this is just a proposed rate Kyle just plugged into numbers just so that we had something to start looking okay yeah because of that what I'm seeing is then at least the minimum should be ten dollars a foot we only have one paying paying nine so that would be my first comment um and then or hung up on the length but um it's really the beam that's the issue you could have a CV that's very narrow and long um versus a he shouldn't be cubic foot or square foot well I'm just saying I mean it gets more it's not as cut and dry as of this paper comes out to be you know because there is that option of you know you've got a center console fishing boat that's pretty narrow and you might fit into one of the more narrow slips yeah but it but it's long the length is there and I don't know if there's some tie to this minimum maximum length that you guys came out what we were doing was making pretty much a generalization that uh the big long boats are generally wider and so we were trying to fill up as as much of the uh trying to make sure whatever boat went into whatever slip it was uh in the right direction of of filling that slip up you know with width and length yeah it's still just a manage it's a it's a dock Master management type yeah well and that literally is that and that's where the problem is it's not as easy as it sounds what I'm trying to do is take this decision away from people that are not professional dock Masters because without some kind of cleared definition they can always be accused of playing favoritism right that's right and so that's that's why if we have some sort of a policy in place um Bill Lusk is here he always has something to say would you care to say anything about this topic I think last means we don't allow a lot of uh input from the citizens during a working session as chair I can ask anybody anything and he's pretty lucky oh yeah it's been intimately involved with with at least following this and making making uh yeah I would like to hear his passive suggestions okay I'd say that's that's a fair a fair way of saying that uh giving us food for thought yeah and you gotta go if you don't mind we're gonna step up to the podium we can't force it doesn't really think ing that was my first look at that guys what I wasn't expecting I think my goal as a resident today to be how do you simplify the city manager's job well satisfying the initial request while giving yourself a backup for you're going to find at times we've seen this once or twice in the last 25 years you're gonna need another list for outside of residence so I find it interesting I I don't know I'm not sure I'm comfortable with three lists but does that make your would that make your life easier Kyle they have things embedded in a lot of ordinances around the management of the marina one of them is tied to the list so if someone is in a slip they get priority to go to a bigger slip size if they want to get a bigger boat if that helps you at all they actually took that into consideration and hey someone 10 years has a 28-footer wants to go to a 37. they get to jump the list and not start over so there's a lot a lot of moving parts to this approach versus I'm going to go from linear to slip that's just cut and dry and and that's the piece I I actually respect Jody's comment like one does it show we put a kayak or any size boat in a beautiful sized slip I think that goes back to the original question I've always had what's the vision High Vision Bellaire Beach isn't a bunch of smaller boats and beautiful wasted Commodities out there it's a real it's a really tough challenge but I think the focus should go back to how do you satisfy the resident issue always have a backup for outside um and I think I'll leave it at that if you're going down the right path with the discussion and I gotta look at Tyler I personally want Kyle's life to be made easier how do I make it easy for him instead of this subjective approach oh I got a big slip gotta get the biggest boat it's Revenue so it's uh it's a pretty tough one would you have any questions like standing here well my question would be is we put out there I got the biggest slip but I don't have the biggest boat is that offensive to other boaters you know it's it's just uh I don't know I've been waiting maybe I should say I've been waiting seven years for a slip too so on how we divvy up three different sizes for people that have been on this list [Music] went through my mind was Space Management and it just isn't efficient Space Management I mean if I'm running a warehouse I don't want to put the copy paper in one of my places I could put the copiers you know what I mean so it just doesn't I understand right but I guess yeah we wouldn't be cutting the price you know one thought and I'm just kind of really thinking about this this is a relatively complex issue um some officer sermons are not some of us are on the list some are not would it be irresponsible to say look with complex issues we usually tend to form a committee or a you know a subset of us is to form one just for the peer issue to encounter the rates the waiting lists and then have them come up with a series of recommendations that present to US versus us trying to from Whole cloth or experience trying to rewrite what many marinas are actively doing you know we get it's the first exercise was done it was just done yeah it's been done two or three times and we've never moved on it um and that's that's the problem is that uh um no matter what you can't satisfy every scenario someone's going to get their feelings hurt someone's going to feel like the cities turn their back on them and uh and and there's there's going to be situations where you can't make people happy um so this was a good starting point to give us something to think about and I know that we're not going to solve this in a day it took me two months see to even have the conversation with Kyle because I really didn't know what would be the best medicine for our community and um I certainly want our community to be first and I want the residents to be taken care of but I also understand that not every situation works out for everyone and uh and it's not by it we're purposely leaving people out but I've just also believed that uh there's going to be situations where you may have to wait longer let's just reverse the situation okay you've got a big boat all right and there's a narrow slip just because it's a narrow slip does that make it fair if it's too narrow for that big boat to go in there he's in the same situation if you're setting if you're setting certain standards for various size slips well then now everyone truly is treated the same let's see if she has the opportunity he has on your phone he can always buy another boat so fit in this little because he's next on the list he has that opportunity to I'm saying if he has the big boat and okay what there's there's really no difference so physically there is a difference but what I'm saying is he's left out now too because the only thing that's available are smaller space and place it in there you can have two boats I mean I'm just going through the list it's a secondary tertiary effect it could it could be the same scenario where the little the guy with a little boat if a big slip is available and he's on that list well he could buy a bigger boat too so I would like you to take time and write us a policy sure and you've got some ideas I want you to take this list in this material if you have the time and you give us something and at and work with Kyle Kyle if you don't mind and then at the next work session let's have this conversation again and Bill I would invite you to come here and and I hear it in person I'd be happy to help some membersate a lot there's a lot of everything it's interesting I think we could do better down there with turnover if we do a little bit more on fetching ordinances maybe that we don't do I think we have a lot of things around you know is your boat capable of moving is it aesthetically pleasing has it runs is the slip empty there's a lot of things that other marinas do that create churn versus someone has retired and moved out of the city that we don't always have to wait for charm that would move a list faster there's a lot of things in I would encourage you to look at that as well it's not a bad idea what they're doing with the designating different listings I think what's going through my mind is not the management of that it's just the fact that there's a current list so just for clarification does that mean that however people are on that list they immediately go into one of three buckets right is that the business I would think so yeah yeah so maybe the other virus chapter communicating like you do every year you're going and scrubbing that list verified this is the way we're moving forward to familiar you're both do you have it and so there's nothing wrong essentially they could pick any bucket they want to be in you know I had a vision years ago you know making sure he's 70 grand very pleased to see we're really close to that we're at 56 no more than two and a half years ago so we pushed the revenue up quickly it would have kept going so try to maintain that number with what you're doing and update I think mayor choose I think your rates are right on target that's what you did 11 10 9 might be low I'll close out with this stock too you have an opportunity with that slip open uh you're also working with some contractors you know slip 16 I think it is that that could be two slips you could throw a little piece down the middle and give some uh 26 Waters in there so it always goes back to what's the big fish and unfortunately sometimes we start with assist and kind of we create a tornado and here we go off to the races so stick to the vision where do you really want to see it 10 years 15 years from now I'll start with I think we should make it easier on the city yeah thank you for that opportunity you're very welcome and thank you for uh Having the courage to speak I apply for a c slip I've been on the list for five years I get a bigger boat so I notify you I need to now go to be ready do I go to the bottom of the list for bra I think you'd have to because otherwise you could play games yeah but I think it's back to the the comment bill made that is you know do we ask everyone if you're if you're already in the marina you have an opportunity to upgrade to a larger slip I thought that was right that's a nice way of handling it when you filming I mean you've got 18 slips it's not that many people to reach out you gotta slip open up so now you're really 17 people you know send a letter we've got you know slip opening up if you have an interest in upgrading let me know give them 10 days to respond and then give and then go down the call list I don't know that's I think that's a great way to handle that yeah we did not even I'm sorry go right ahead Mr Roberts I was going to ask the question about I know we had some discussion about ultimately trying to get to the goal of having all the slips to Resonance because we just felt like that's the right thing to do we we've never even got to that part of the conference okay okay there was so much shock value to the introduction of the uh the classifications that we we didn't make it anymore and where where are we just an estimate number of how many residents versus non-residents are currently in this stuff just about I'm just curious two or three for a little more than half it's not awesome why are you looking that up I do agree what um Jody was saying that Bill said about if you're already have a slip and you're in a b slip and an a slip becomes available we'd have to have something in the ordinance to Define how you're going to handle that so now I've always wanted to get a bigger boat so now I have that opportunity because an a-slip is available I'm going to sell my Bebo and if I'm next in line of a current slip owner to upgrade I think that would be a cool offer to the people that are there you don't go to the bottom of the list that would be cruel um council members Abel uh what I would I'll write these notes but what I would uh challenge you to do is start with with what we've given no I'm going to start with the ABC and just start start with that and build on it and uh and rather than tearing it apart I would say enhance it I will and um the city manager has uh has some great ideas that we discussed about um what to do with um non-residents and uh people that have rental properties but they don't live here how you identify who is a full-time resident and how they should get preferential treatment um Mr riesler you have all that information and yes and the regulations of the marina are covered over city ordinance over the actual agreements that they signed and the administrative policy for the waitlist so it's kind of spread out but all that information is important and that kind of governs the marina um and then I have a lot of information through discussions with Mr Lusk of what other marinas do and a lot of considerations ideas to to look into and and also I I know it was unfortunate what happened with the gentleman that came here and and spoke um but he's not the first person that's happened to and um I think about all the people that that's happened to before him right now we have certain policies in place and um it's it's kind of a bummer uh that that he had to step up and speak but I think about the other people that are probably going to feel cheated until we have a policy in place and we re-reboot this list so I just kind of want to remind you of that yeah yep we're definitely enhancing it and work with it as far as the opening right now do you want to we can reach out to the existing slip renders and see if anyone is interested in upgrading to the larger slip the one if thing is you know it's easy for somebody who uses a wet slip somebody's got a lift already it's a much bigger deal so that's something to consider I'm really struggling to hear you tonight for something sorry that's all I was saying if we could we can look into sort of a legacy policy where um existing slip Runners have an opportunity to upgrade to the size the size size 19 foot beam slip 16. um but again that's a that's kind of a process so if somebody was say they have a list a lift in their current slip um I I guess we could see what interest we have out there but we would have to define the criteria of how they move and how much time and all that all those processes temporary policy to migrate as to whatever the new policy is right there has to be some sort of a sure because I don't want to see that just sitting empty while we kind of figure out because I don't want to rush the process either are there vacant slips right now you have one with our largest slip is one of the in-water boats you said um excuse me um how do we prioritize that's another question of the people who are interested in the moving into slip 16 do we prioritize it by how long they've been at the marina or prioritize it by the size of their boat are they in the the a level size it depends [Music] no they're they're spread they're all different size boats I'm writing the policy as I go here uh using the ABC structure that I would say that only those that are in the a can be approached for that no because we're talking about existing tenants that may want to buy a bigger boat and now we have a slip that can accommodate and perhaps put the word out I don't know it's uh um would you like a bigger bow [Music] to make sure is this your current goal is this what you're thinking so when they go into different categories they're the right one yeah they know the numbers too I think you're right there's probably I don't even know how to go about that but pick something and satisfy whatever you want to which card still Runners I just don't like the idea that there's an average slip that was one of our most beautiful quotes and it should represent ative okay um so yeah I guess uh you're gonna call out you're gonna call some people with uh in smaller slips with smaller boats and see if anyone's looking for an upgrade right now my mind says let's start with the person who's been there give the opportunity a person who's been there the longest and then just go down to the newest person in there really create a domino effect which is okay yeah so if the 14 moves to 16 and then that's open now and and so much for making your job easy there you go that's what I'm sitting here thinking about I'm like right now you've got a slip open and you've got someone that wants it really is what it comes down to is what you came to us with today you have someone who has a 28 foot boat but he's talking about a 32-foot boat and it would like that slope and he was number four he has a 30 he put he's on the list for a 32 foot boat he'll pay the 32 foot price um until he gets um 32-foot boat I guess and then you'll repeat the process until basically like you said everybody's kind of cleaned it up and then now you got true openings but again this is somebody who doesn't have a boat who doesn't it has a boat but has not been on the list very long oh right well I would advise you to have something in place before you start screwing around with the with our current tenants correct and and give that if if there's someone in line that's eligible right now under the current policy I would let them have it until we change our policy uh and if that the next person in line does not want that slip then move on to the next one just like you've done in the past until you you find a renter and then whenever the regular policy is finished then we can address how to deal with everybody so that way it's full two questions the next person in line is a resident we got rid of all the non-residents of the waitlist right well there's still non-residents we haven't gone as far as to Nixon but um it prioritized Always by residence first and we we have established that they need to be residents not just Property Owners so that that is a stipulation the gentleman leaving or the boat that's leaving is that a resident or is that was a residence okay and they've moved or what have you I believe they got a bigger boat and they're touring gotcha is their summary yeah 19 feet won't accommodate that it was a big vote three they had a 45 footer yeah so um and then the guy with a 30 that wants to get the 32 he's gonna have to invest in a lift is that is he I don't know what his plans are but he was willing to pay that six months worth put out the boat and I was going to make it clear that you must have the boat no refunds sorry so you gotta have that kind of yeah about six months to get it in yeah there's a lot of hair on that I mean there's a lot to think about with regards I don't think we're gonna solve it tonight there's we need a policy and a works I mean and I Think It's tricky because we always got to rework the agreement to facilitate that right and and I don't want to micromanage you but but you can't halfway you can't do piece work on the policy and constantly change it we need to have a finished product before we change things change the rules do you have someone else on in line that has a bigger boat because it's really that width of that slip that's an issue it's not the length it's the you got a 19 foot wide foot that's you know so biggest boat I have in hand right now is a 28 footer on the list yeah we've already and it puts all away good point so we have non-residents that have a bigger oh yeah we have plenty of non-residents Style is your issue where everyone we optimize non-resident Revenue both sides to the central Department you're going to be dealing with 48 .6 bullets 24 quarters 32 quarters of which often fit in the majority of them but when you have the biggest money-making slip we might want to think about that [Music] mix it's you know the moments moving was somewhat rare as far as yeah all right I'm gonna have to end the conversation and the reason why is because you're on public record and we can't hear you oh no worries no worries I'll have you have to get up and yeah speak into the microphone we're just going to get you a lapel pan bring your seat at the table okay so uh you you okay with that yeah no I mean policy writers like okay okay all right I'm gonna buy a boat now uh any other uh Laos before we move on to item number four what what is what is the direction on um this open slip on my open slip I think right now until the policy changes you have to treat it the way we've always treated it okay what's on Kyle all right or there's another option which is you don't do anything with it until we until we do the policy because if you're going to um I think the council has already spoken that that we don't want to let non-residents ahead of residents we don't really know what the situation is with how this is all going to unfold after the fact because there's no as far as non-residents go I'm not loyal to them but as far as residents go I am and if we currently don't have a resident ready to jump into that slip I don't want to commit to five to ten years of a non-resident whenever we're just right around the corner of solving a problem for our community I mean to do maintenance on that one slip if we were to get that's a non-resident you know we're looking at the Ballpark an average about 300 a month we'd be losing that's not a huge amount of money to leave a slip open and get a policy worked out for assets that are definitely a high demand for the city I'd like to challenge his counsel to in for two to three months we wrap this up and we exactly say we're done with this yes and I just would say when we're looking at the being there should be a premium based on the beaminess of that slip so the width is square foot the beaminess I mean because yeah because this is a valuable slip I mean I hate to put it that way but it it is and I don't know if you can make it I don't think it's big enough that you can make it too because then that doesn't you know it's 19 feet so that beats six inch pile eight inch pile that's what Bill had suggested a couple of times so if you split it in half it basically enough it's nine and a half we got nine eight yeah it doesn't work that way you're going to have collisions yeah left navigation sorry are we 100 uh committed uh the way that our permitting is on the uh Marina or is that what we're stuck with no no it could be redesigned and we even had that plan that they did the additional catwalk it's done a while ago but because I think Bill may be on to something that that maybe we should take a deeper dive into is that maybe you resize the the adjacent slip optimize a little bit and then that way you could open up and have two accommodating slips uh actually you generate more Revenue by having two boats in there than one large boat and you would also fit in that that area that's a sweet spot for Bel Air Beach residence which is about a 24-28 foot boat with a narrow beam so just some things to consider for sure [Music] I mean yeah it's a domino all right because then you start moving and you're moving lifts then you're moving you know do we want to take on all of that responsibility unless you had those last whatever forced lips all open up at once well it's like a business plan you just propose financially like we're doing now what would take to get to from A to B um and is it financially worth at that point or you go back to looking at the floating docks or something and and you know having that that old plan where you have a catwalk that runs out and you have another you know and so you use up that extra space for that for that catwalk or something so Kyle real quick on your list there so if we did split that um 19 foot width into a nine six and a nine six which would be right next to a nine eight how many boats do we have on the list now that are residents that would fit in there that are looking for a slip that would that would be that c yeah I mean we already have a slit Mike that's nine feet eight inches splitting the other one in half would make it nine six two inches is in the beginning of a foot clearance on each side is what we currently say um so if we got nine and a half you got five boats at the bottom of the list that could fit in that it would fit in there is that a resume that are say their resonance yes at a residence we could fill it bam bam well it's it all depends upon how their um how they're securing their boat and I mean a lot of things can happen I see it at the Yacht Club we've got some slips where there's literally nothing between the boats but uh whenever they're not secured perfectly if things aren't exactly in sync they do hit each other and people get irritated about it and so there's always that little bit of liability to consider yeah but but 296 lists would generate more money like we just said than the 119 footstep can we we discussed this too much of course it's been beat but I guess I'll work with it there's so many options and now we're talking like almost redesign um it kind of all comes down to like what is the vision I don't know exactly right what's the vision that's right okay I think immediately we have we have a policy issue and then if we want to later on discuss doing some repurposing of what we have that's another conversation does the council agree yeah I don't know how you make any other decision with the current resident other than following the current policy right you can't just sit on that curve yeah months it's a week before I sort it out so we'll get something sorted out I would say don't wait for us don't let something sorted out you need to proceed like like we never had this conversation okay all right yeah I would think so where's my Men in Black thing I can do that we forgot everything all right we have uh we have 10 minutes left uh Mr riefler there are two items that you have placed on here which one uh would you like to wrap up for denial item four and item five I guess I can postpone item four because um I'd like to get um Granny and I were talking about the consent agenda for making a bank exchange um and this came from a proposal from Valley Bank um uh this advisory committee chair Ron saganic has been working with us with um and he has a lot of experience with this bank and then the surrounding banks in the area so he felt like this was a very good choice and main reasons being that um they're going to offer us the uh Target fed funds minus 50 basis points interests which is much better than we're getting now from our current bank which is truest and they are also not charging us any bank service fees and currently we get charged anywhere over our accounts are truest from 500 to close to a thousand dollars worth of fees and they their interest is very low where they do a 0.4 rate offset interest and then only give they've only given us 0.5 uh rate on the balance which is extremely low especially the given interest rates they've never reached out to offer us anymore I'm sure if we negotiate they probably would do more but at this point I think we have a very good deal with Valley and their proposal um Heather and I met with Valley on May 5th and um met the staff uh felt very good about the bank they uh told us they have a they're well qualified with an average score of 76 for the uh is a qualified public depository rating um with uh the collateral management office with the state so um they also offered that if anyone has direct questions about um that they can answer that we reach out and they provided a contact but quick question about right now we're undergoing bank failures do they have a parent company uh what's their track record what's their asset Center management because frankly governments have gone under for just this reason they look for a short-term interesting or maybe a slightly favorable look for personal checkbooks and it was the back office their their loans that the bank has that put them in default I have a data sheet um okay so it's a bad Nationwide I've never heard of the bank but Nationwide activities they're very very well healed them things with them for many years locally and then Valley came in and purchased them it was a different bank before before none they're the best bank I don't you know and uh in full disclosure I mean I don't want to be accused of being involved with this I have not been my daughter works for them she's getting no credit for any of this but they are um and this branch is great I mean I literally have a branch manager cell phone on my phone and anytime I need money transferred I call them anything I need I just call him direct he handles it he's it's a very well run very feels like a Community Bank when you go in the branch we're still under FDIC et cetera oh yeah but our our rates are higher being a government institution than the fdaic um I don't have the exact numbers on that though that they're higher the the insurance on them would they have a government office I mean they have a member this Gary Miller city of Valor Bluffs just recently and that that's um Andy um with Heather's accounting firm I made that move I notice it says the rate index will remain in effect until April 30th 2023. that doesn't give me a real warm feeling about there that's why I look at bags and failures um awesome yeah I think it basically what they're saying I'll clarify this is that um it'll get adjusted with the federal funds rate okay I mean their letter went out April 25th and just are we concerned about that are they clarification and uh and the intention is to um put again put this in the next council meeting for an approval and then uh you know work from there and it would be a transition process obviously we'd be um opening accounts and moving it strategically uh you know as as we uh have to change our direct deposits um for some of our uh incoming infrastructure funds and some of our payments all that stuff would have to be coordinated and even our purchasing cards and things who made the initial recommendation to do this um it came up in our in our overall CIP um analysis of where we're sitting where where our money like where our money's being held and what the interest is because we uh any discussions of like talking about the bond issue you know we're calculating interest rates rising and we're comparing you know what interests we'll be paying versus how much we'll be making on our assets so then it kind of came into discussion then so was the citizens advisory committee that came up with this and I can tell you I'm involved in several non-profit boards and everyone is moving their money to smaller localized Banks because they're offering better interest rates I'm good with that everybody else so currently we have yeah we have truest um and then we would be opening an account with this and then the only right now our capital and I don't know why it is like this our uh our Capital Improvement fund is with uh Bank United so we plan on keeping it there for now but if things work well with transferring our operating accounts over to the valley that would be the intention because it doesn't make sense to have all these separate Banks right it doesn't Bank United hold the mortgage though is that no that that is truest we'll have to keep an account open until we complete that mortgage say whoever we have our mortgage was does this require a resolution um I don't believe so Randy will be answered I'm looking at your past documents I haven't seen one adopted previously as to how it goes um if it comes before you um at the next meeting and and a resolution is required one will be prepared um I have not prepared it today as of yet Kyle and I were just discussing this earlier today and I I just received the documentation but if it requires a resolution trust and believe a resolution will be before you for that purpose or what you voted up and down as you as you deem necessary do we have any time constraints uh preventing us from making it to the meeting no it's a resolution you don't need any ads or anything like that um so it really just comes down to and and Kyle and I specifically spoke about timing this morning and when we discussed it um you know just noted that given where we are in the month um meeting off cycle our next meeting is only two short weeks away um so that gives us you know that's that's not a significant delay there were no time pressures that he felt made it I was just making sure we weren't missing a rate window of opportunity I'm not aware of any um clarification on the rate and um through our discussions and meetings I did not feel any kind of time constraint on this it's okay um of course I reached out to him then communicated that I was taking into this work session and then the plan yeah is uh either way we'll we'll vote and uh we'll get it approved and uh we'll move ahead Mr Mayor since we still have 30 seconds left I think uh number four could be discussed and yeah it gives everyone's ready too pretty simple yeah um and it's a draft so really um the idea the idea behind this again it was a city manager goal um to to kind of come up with a policy for uh seeking out grant funding um for like our capital projects or it could even uh pertain to our operating budget but um I just started with you know just just defining what the this admin policy which um what it's for um and then kind of in the policies and procedures section uh talked about um sources of uh of monitoring grants which was uh we joined the the FLC uh Grant assistance program that was brought up I think it was like four or five months ago so they provide uh email and a website assistance with everything that's it's on a national scale um of of all the grand opportunities and funding as it comes through and then um I and and uh subsection B I kind of brought up that every time that a uh we're considering a project that it would be the city manager's responsibility to to look for alternate alternate sources of funding um and you know and I listed out for uh Grant programs that we've looked at in the past that we've that we've worked with uh put in applications and I think with uh with grant funding um sometimes it's tough for us to meet all the criteria but it doesn't mean we should ever stop trying because I it's my mindset there's like that keeping up um relations with the crack coordinators and the regional directors of these grants that sometimes um when they don't allocate all the funds they do lower uh qualifications there and it does open up because they do want to distribute the money um so I kind of summarize that um and and I also covered the uh ongoing grants that you know they're not much but we do them every year and I think that if it's money if it's a program that gives us money back um that we should always continue to do it and it just kind of talks about who is assigned so I um hoping in the future that you know we just have a longer list of money that we're getting and who's responsible for getting that money these are the ones on currently on your radar though correct yes and like I said with the um so we get right now we have the the magic safety Grant and then we have the Pinellas County um recycling Grant and we always submit for that money um but like I said right now I'm currently working with that hurricane uh Ian Hazard mitigation program um probably have a little bit of luck because with the stormwater projects we found that we couldn't get anywhere close to that BCR but then the idea was with this undergrounding project trying to come up with enough creative uh benefit um through as much as residents that work from home and the the money that they injected to the economy through their jobs and I mean any way we can to try and meet a benefit ratio for the cost of the projects that we're trying in a league of cities program did we just get that because we're members yeah we that you brought it up at one of the meetings and and I joined it and it's just it's a program that just kind of keeps keeps it near to the ground of like almost some grads that you've never even heard of in your life all over the country and it's just you know it's just a good it's a good consolidation of what's going on just to keep those ideas and opportunities going through your head it's a short and sweet and it uh gets to the point so I like it any comments or suggestions or questions okay Joe I like it and uh let's uh use it and like I said just admin policy is something that we can we can write into it and follow it at any point so okay well uh Mr Banker thank you so much for uh reminding me that we still had that one item left 30 seconds I would have passed it off but uh nice job yeah you you broke my rule of nine o'clock so uh we will not discuss any new business or unfinished business and uh I would like a motion all right"
