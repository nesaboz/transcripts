I thought about that but that's what it was at the time at the time great minutes Michael beautiful thank you I tell you one one thing I I said to myself um this morning I said I have got to write clearer cuz I had one note and I was like what does that say yeah tell me about that so is a a tangerine what's the other word for tangerines they were Clementine cuties Halo cuties okay all right cuties so yeah so no what I what I have here is cooties and then I got CH and I took a picture of and I was zooming in and I was like and then because we had something in here about Koozies and I was like what is this and then when I zoomed in and like put it on like 400% I said I think that says Tanger oh my gosh okay so do I have a motion to approve the Amendments yes I will make a motion to approve and second second all right so approved all right citizen comment since there's no citizen here yet okay we'll move on into we can move on to the amenity inspection reports okay that's our Parks right yeah that's parks and Michael put it so nicely in here that's why I'm frantically texting Patty the other day I'm like which Parks did I sign up for oh yeah that's okay then I got lost I had to haveon help me find H biscus I'm taking pictures of a park that doesn't well at least it wasn't mine what did you say it was B Isles well that yeah that was B par that you're like is this H biscus right no it's B well doing where's hibiscus it's on East hibiscus uh about middle of the I don't even know what the address would be on that 20 no 3,000 it's a half lot yeah it is um do you know the ones on first and second that are just like little Pathways in between homes kind of that's what it is it's I okay well I'll probably pass it 400 times and I yeah because you know it Forks yeah High best is one time but then it goes all the way is it at that fork is it right off of bell did you you go down B take a left on East okay thank you second so you're heading in the Bellis okay take a left on East hibiscus and then go down about four or five HS and start on your right hand side okay yeah it's a you'll miss it if you're not looking I'm looking and I missed it so do does anybody know Jules Chandler y of course all right is it close to her house oh I don't know where she lives yeah it's it's like maybe is it on little block 200 ft it's a short little on the east side so okay just so it's real close to Bell Park Then when you're back if you're backtracking and you make the you can see okay yeah I've walked past it probably 40 times not noticed it all right um I I I don't I did I did some some of mine you did some of yours I'm done it's in not only is mine done my reports are generated therein and so are my pictures all right you you're all done I haven't I am done you got a lot that's enough so with the reports that you and John have done I've already got them in the book see so they're already the book and then on the action on the action uh form that I'm doing I'm going through what you guys have put down um and including that into our action form at the Shell around the the Ben is on the sea wall yeah standard there's a crack on the on the bench I need to go take a look at then like the roots those are already painted so you know so we're already starting on those um so yeah so just as you guys know as soon as you get them into me I'm inputting them but then we're trying to so yeah so we've already got a bunch of men huh uh will four I uh yeah four yeah 1 two three four I got one how we doing we doing them in that format I mean this is fine I love this format it was simple did you get it yeah I yeah I know I sat down with Renee here and I just downloaded yeah she did you know obviously we like to get the font here should be like that but this Renee did that the city clerk yeah I know and I think it was great because what I did was I downloaded and then just typed the answers out in it exctly you got the F the sizing everything else and it's this is all conforms with the that smart the jber well this is what mine look like ma'am so but but but I'm telling you after you yeah when you download it it's easier to send yeah to so really we should this this font okay this font and the size we everything should be in that font that's that's kind of the idea then everything will be consistent with everything else the city does yeah which is what you did when you use that form yeah right okay so you already you've already done everything you could possibly do I really like the idea that you just took the thing and did it and that's exactly the way it was supposed to work well we appreciate if you had any input in it cuz it really worked well for me last time all I did the best I did the smartest thing I could possibly do I went to the city court Renee I said what what what is the best between these two reports and and she came out with this thing I said there it is perfect okay so um you just want me to type them up and send them to you whatever you want to do okay and the pictures just from my phone I can just send them okay is there is there some kind of a a format on those pictur pictures I basically just said you know here's a list and here's the pictures on sending an email or just again most of them I can I mean figure out where I guess for me U I would prefer cuz I know what the Parks look like I would prefer to see like the problem you know the the the the issue that you might see rather than just the park um because I I see them almost daily cuz I'm going to them daily so um well almost daily so like if you see the problem like the roots yeah take a picture of the roots or like the crack bench crack bench you know what I didn't take a picture of was the electrical outlets so but you know it's a far walk from here to that Park mhm it is over a walk and then I have to wait for the light tce you know I forgot to take the pictures the outlets for crossin or yeah so those need I didn't see yeah one Outlet um it's a double outlet and it has no facial cover okay and then the spotlight that goes on the sign uhuh the neck is broken there's tape around the wire and the wires look exposed okay so yeah I I wrote that it was a hazard what park is that um the one on the corner where we're hoping to do the Veterans Memorial Park right here that that [Music] H it's not that way I came in that way that way okay anything else on the on the reports pointing the same way how many do you have already done got do I have what how many do you have completed I have uh the southeast m is all I got done okay so the rest the rest of I'll have done by the next meeting at the latest John he took a lot so what he should be done by now he slacking I I I have an excuse but I don't want to I don't want to complain I do have uh one of those parts done yes I'm a little behind but I did um I did do the the standardization project you did first that's correct unfortunately I've got a um uh uh a an unexpected work issue that has um created problems for me and uh so but don't worry Kyle I I know I'm I'm a go-getter and all that well John you've helped me out if you need a open a park or two you you have um what Seventh Street and Bayside and this is Bayside right yeah Bayside I did yeah Bayside and I got seven Street which actually I already have done okay but I just haven't put it together okay and you know so all I got to do is you know walk up here you know it's like this what I did here and then the other it's nothing I'll done don't worry if are all the rest of them done no no I haven't well Morgan Park is brand new up to you yeah's done are you all done with yours I just haven't sent them to him but they're Michael's not done it's okay listen let let this is supposed to be [Music] B I'm tell you before his okay I'm done by the way they'll be done by next meeting at the latest I can assure you that well you need them before then I'll help de said she help okay anything else on the reports that was a lot that was a lot though it was so now it's an update on the muralist Miss Deb you have the floor she's maybe sent me a text so I can find out is she still coming hello Rachel what's her name Renda Renda you're still coming cuz originally it was at 2:30 and then I told her 2:30 oh and then I said it's changed but still coming okay so in in the inum I will give you a little update on the muralist um one I spoke with John comr and asked him if he would be willing to do the work either as some type of donation like where we could maybe give him an in kind donation if that were possible but in addition pay him for part of it to do like in in other words maybe we can he would split the price with it with us or something so we also talked about him knowing other artists we talked about maybe getting the high school art students to help him um he doesn't have a lot of time on his hands but he I did say to him it doesn't have to be quite as intricate as what we have now and what your drawings did cuz he did that all by AI yeah and uh so it was kind of cool he could easily change it and he said he would be honored like to do something for us and to put his name on the wall here and stuff this is his vibe he loves it here just like we do and he was gay and he said if he couldn't do it he knew other artists who may be able to do it he was going to brainstorm but did tell me if I'm going to come what budget do I have available so I said well my meeting right now we don't have a budget we're going to go to this meeting and maybe we could discuss it like what do you think we would need or what would it cost because at a minimum the paints right you know so at a minimum and you know so that was that um I contacted Jolie which was recommended to me um by Patty Yolie said I don't have the confidence in my work to do something like that but thank you for thinking of me we said Okay and she said however the person who lives across the street may be interested her name is Brenda so then I called Brenda and Brenda was very receptive she said she moved here during Co she's been trying to get involved but didn't really know how or who I'm wanting to meet new people here and I explained the project I said I'm not really sure why you know they told me to speak to you and she says oh painting is my hobby I love to paint she owns a company up in New Jersey still coming back and forth um but she said yeah painting is my therapy I would love to do it and so I said well you know think about what you want us to put it out and ask for volunteers to help you paint is this something you just want to do maybe with a friend or like you think about how you wanted to do it so then she was also saying she would be interested in getting involved so I said well as the potential artist who may be able to come here she wanted you to see the sketches and everything I said it would be also good to see how we conduct business here and you'll you'll be able to determine if you'd like to help or not so but she didn't come maybe she got held up in a meting maybe she'll come at 2:30 yeah whatever okay that's even if she does that's perfect yeah I sent her the links and everything so so she could read all about everything uh that's what she paints does she paint like canvas paintings there a big difference in mural she knew she knew what was going on the bathrooms and I said to her she said like you know she loves to do Secret cuz I was originally saying hey it doesn't even have to be like that intense like we could maybe do weed like you know the grass weeds whatever yeah and she said oh I was like really hoping I could do turtles because this are we really represents Turtles I was like well honey if you want to draw Turtles you could go ahead and draw mermaids and dolphins and anything you want and she goes oh I could draw draw a doll a mermaid sitting on a rock with turtles around I said I love that I figured we'll let people here and we'll see you know and we'll decide what kind of there be a mer man also yeah let's do a merou okay yeah you're the model no I'm not that be Aug whale okay okay you're good Kyle you said that of course we would have to have everything approved by the council would the actual painting itself or the sketch need to be approved by them or just the fact that we're asking them you know for some money or just approval to do it I think it would be best to show them the idea yeah like I mean this kind of idea we wouldn't have to like be this detailed right no I mean I think the general idea of what it's going to look like okay you know doesn't have done but so we don't have any idea about like how much money we could the parks and rec committee could spend on this and I just have this general question I mean about procurement okay procurement what is the process so I mean I'm thinking on mural is going to cost what $2,000 $3,000 well comr in your original um 1,500 to 2500 per wall depending on the details and but that's too much oh the color ones are way too much yes all of these are too much for me or what I was thinking like where's the palm tree there's one that's just palm trees okay this one I think that's between the bathroom doors best I can look at yeah that's pretty I mean I love the parrot but that's not b beach I like the turtle idea yeah or you know we could do a sunset with a turtle like you know the babies going down or something yeah b beach is definitely about turtles and we could all brainstorm also and ask people what they like but simple so it's very simple for that amount it's really just the fact that you know they approve it in the budget we don't even have what does it come so what you have you go to the city council yes well it'd be best if you guys presented the idea um you know recommended it it's just so go so at the next meeting could we just put the idea out there or do we have to have a specific detail from something no the idea of doing public art at Morgan Park okay you think it would be a benefit to the city and then you know if they're on board it's just a matter of all just all put in the budget so what happens we have to request it or you you request them to look at it who ask get like your Senor board report okay you could just make a recommendation that's all you're doing that we include something like that in the budget and if they have interest I just stick it in there and then okay so can we mention in our bud and do we go through you or whoever to get us on the agenda for the next meeting um we have quarterly board reports and I think April is is a quarterly so I can bring it up then your newsletters coming out soon at the end of the month I guess yes oh frak okay wait no even months even yeah April yeah end of yeah or middle of April yeah somewhere there yeah we said what first yeah we have the information okay move on that so the so the so the the answer is we we want to do this and it sounds like a good idea we probably can but should we should we just be providing some kind of an estimate say the cost is estimated somewhere between $1,500 to $3,000 so why yeah why don't have in budget you don't have to spend it all so we can put you know 3,000 in the budget right and then that way you can go we can get it going mhm that's why I said can we be at the next meeting yeah okay thanks at the next meeting at their next meeting their so we're going to get the approval and then we're going to go and we're going to see if we can get somebody obviously we can't get anybody for that we'd have to go back and say we can't get it done for less than that you know what would be cool I'm sorry to interrupt you is to get it like spray painted like you know the T-shirt people who do the spray paint design yeah because they could do like sunsets and you know it doesn't have to be intricate again but doesn't John do a lot of spray painting I don't know how does he do it I think he does I think um I cut you right when I was watching the video of him and I think he said something about that the first time we talked do do we know there are any I know there's not a lot of kids here and I don't know about high school but any High School b beach no but there's lgo would probably do hours please I cut John off do you remember what you were saying H do you remember what you were saying I always focused on getting the preapproval I'm not an artist I will say I do have I mean I I have a name but if we've got this all figured out I mean I'd like to kind of get it moving along here because summertime's coming up and all that that's what I said I wanted to do before it's too hot to paint yeah we dry too quickly painting out there that's why so um yeah some of those look pretty uh pretty intricate um but I don't know what the what the range is I mean if you got something nice for Less that'd be good too only reason I mentioned this I was talking to Aaron my dentist there was a mural on a a privacy fence right across you know so that's what you looked at when you're sitting there in your tooth cleaning deal like that and I said well you you know I said I bet you paid for it I said I did and he still has a name so if we want to go out for bids or find something an elicer price but if we're already okay here I'm totally good I mean we don't have anybody yet that's committed so nor do we have a price but let's so we'll need the paints I guess or just whatever their cost for a paint is and um so so you trying to do it this spring yeah yes oh I was talking about for the next budget next year next year no we w't do this now work well I can um I'll have to check to see how much you got left in your in your current budget cuz unless they're going to do an amendment to what our budget is i' rather i' rather do the I if I have a vote I'd rather put money towards doing that if parks and Rex has a budget then doing a Pets and Pals parade you know what I'm saying like I would rather take the money that we spent this year cuz I think the I can just tell them that we have money in the budget that was for promotional events but ask yeah because I think this is important it's important for the town I think I think so we spent a lot of time there's all you know the trucks going through there was closed out and everything else like that and and people come from outside of b beach to use that facility and the rest of them you know they're all run down but it doesn't make any difference that's what we got so so I I think whatever I don't know what the budget is for Parks R but I mean we don't have to do all sides at once I mean we can do one wall you know oh I love that idea do the main wall and then add on to that so it' be you know to get a start off was it you and I talking or somebody that said don't even bother with the north side wall yeah that was so you're just doing the beach side and the street side and then between the two doors which is a very small space so oh so the the only side we're not doing is a side fa in the other building behind us oh that makes a whole bunch of sense so we're down to three walls and two and a half you I mean you can access but nobody's going nobody ever except for the just do we could just do the door side first and that you know do the door side oh I say the street side I say I say the street side too yeah the door side is not very big but okay I say whatever I'm told the street side then from from the street it's going to look beautiful you know so as we the totally that's just I just let's let's let's get something done on it right okay and I don't see although it looks really really really nice when I did Morgan Park that was one of my I I wrote really nice things about it the color is fantastic the floor in the bathroom is phen Al although the L's room was out of order locked yeah um but I went in the mids room at the floor in there and that is the perfect floor for this kind of I don't know it's a would you do like a it's like we use in a garage yeah like the epy you could be wet you could be slippery pass along the gra and the Pavilion with the two table and the two benches in the third bench and and the new barbecuer that's in there brand new barbecuer in there did you say two tables now was there one before no there were two tables they were just they were I don't know anyway the way it's arrange looks really nice now now the bike rack is gone is it coming back any type of bike rack coming back no it because we talked about it needed either painting or get it get one of those but we looked at it it was the Bottom bar was rusted and broken so if you want a new bike rack um want to get a new one okay and and probably the same kind of stuff as maybe the table that's what we talked about last year like the resin recycle plastic something cuz the the Metal's just not going to work I could I can call them up and see how much that that runs iag probably 5 600 bucks yeah doesn't need to be huge I don't see that many people ride bikes to more four or five single ring is about all you need yeah a single ring sitting up around like that it's m that's not a bad idea that would be a single ring and you can four trash can fabulous we're actually got more garbage cans so we're putting um it should be done today by uh six we had an issue over the weekend last weekend uh with the one bathroom nice weather and garbage was kind of overflowing and the bathroom toilet was uh toilet paper was out so we're trying to do our best to get the toilet that we need in uh we thought it was going to be in yesterday Amazon didn't tell us the truth so I got I got that to us for free but we're still getting a toilet um but that won't be until Monday but it's not the H on the wall is that what was in there it is hung in the wall it is it's a wall hung uh rear Spud with which is the very difficult one to fight so it took us forever to fight it okay yeah but we got it right so yeah so what is the process what is the process to get this done okay the process is as Kyle said we have to go to the board on the April meeting which is in two weeks tell them this is an idea we have and we would like to do it ASAP if we have enough funds ourselves that I can okay but they still have to say that it's okay for us to paint on their bathroom right on our bathroom whatever they have to approve the project itself correct well they just got to approve how because the money is in the budget currently for promotional events which they approved and they just need to approve that the money goes towards public art and and you know it' be I think it' be nice to share the design you know give them some kind of or a a semi designer yeah you know that we're working on something but yeah yeah I mean I could draw them one but it'll look like a kindergarten drew it but I can say that we're going to have a turtle here and a palm tree here and some sea oos or something here okay so that's we're going to so when is that when is the April that one page is pretty um to have on a wall did you see the page below it like even just something like that on a wall like this the wall fa in the ocean or something course I rather the turtles complicated yeah I think that's more detailed than one turtle with some Sea Oats do you I don't know no it's just a couple of starfish I don't think that's too hard to draw oh no I'm not so you're saying Kyle what would really work the best would be say you're doing it and they're looking at something like this decid exactly sure so we might we might as well sell the sizzle to them if we want to get it done right so why don't we put up the best one of these pictures you know you don't here man get the picture up there okay this what they got in mind they go hey yeah all right we'll look for let's all look for something on the Internet that we might like but would we would watch something that would be feasible for our budget right yeah like one of them I didn't even print out is this something a guy can do for this one wall so this is $800 or something yeah see I like this one with the SE yeah that's pretty that's excellent that's much better than this there could be a turtle here instead of especially on the street so that says this is what's over there I like that this is very good so we can get this done for a th000 bucks I I don't know I'm not a miror list not you but somebody's got AIG with these people you know what I mean have we'll bid we'll bid but I think if we could at least budget for 3,000 or 3500 and or see what we have see what we have and yeah maybe you know maybe we do a little fundraiser I don't can we fundraise in this in this um Organization no right we have a sponsorship program a sponsorship okay um it was more for an event was going to say maybe we put up a cuz I have paint the Morgan Beach fund right now I well you have the um this mural presented by we do all have the park adoption program that like could be used in that was them adopt Park yeah but if we can get an artist or something if we're get the park to adop if we get someone ah ah or sever some ones to go in together and adopt that they adop a wall in it maybe they could adopt a wall on there I mean so they adopt the park is Parks and wck not the foundation no it's the foundation okay that's what I what no that's a city program adopt the park so you're talking about like the like down here and um 19 and 12 those anybody can adopt see I thought what do you mean adopt because I I could get you the paperwork it's a program that we put together what do we do with it we own it it's the foundation no it's it's a it's kind of like a contractual agreement um of like you know you provide some kind of improvement to the park and you it's an agreement that's why I thought it was the foundation because the foundation it is the foundation no okay I'm not going to argue with you cuz I know wants to adopt a park okay so adopt a park is wait what do you it's like adop the street like adop the highway type CLE okay and then like depending on what you do it kind of determines the time period Isn we adopted through it's our own program set up where want to do something the city will form an agreement and we'll put their name out there it's all spell out okay this is a great idea okay okay so we Patty somebody needs to talk to whoever wherever we got this picture do this picture come from a muralist or do we find that came from a muralist but it is an AI program okay okay a live body that will stand behind us I can do this for some price yes there is a yeah he sent that to me exactly right I agreed so that person do we are we ready to uh do you think we want to work with that he wanted me to come back to him with an answer on what type of funds would be available because I was asking him to do part in donation okay of his time and just him no and maybe pay for part and he said he would be willing to do that but he had to know what kind of money we were able to offer back but if I just say hey John I'm going to take this over from now if that's okay Patty and I'll just say hey John we see how it says feedback he wanted feedback so if we say yeah right now we're just going to do the one what can you get me for this I'll email it to Renee I'll have Renee tell all of you immediately okay and then we'll move it quickly without the meetings as soon as I get numbers from people and we'll start with this yeah some yeah so let me take a picture of this would you ask them too um when what the best way to clean that wall would be like what to use on it yeah what kind of paint cuz that's what's going to make the difference clean so clean first to be cleaned first or well I mean no I mean we would what type of paint after it's done what would be the best way to keep it clean yeah and and help it to be maintained right in terms of wear and tear yeah okay just so the guys know what to put on what not to put on there D you don't need to take a picture you can have that no just take a picture you could keep it I have all of them on my computer and I just printed them I can print them again okay I'll take it yeah that's good what what day is the April meeting we have't the council meeting 1 oh April 1 oh no it's the first bunch of fools there that day they my birthday the first Monday is the first your birthday's the 31st it is oh my niece and Easter this year all on your birthday 48 so Deb are you going to for Kyle are you going to be able to take this thing or something and show it to the city council and say this is what we got in mind or do that that was your idea okay we have see something John we have to show them we have to show them something yes we will we will be at the April meeting and I will show them something and say this is what we want to do just give us your AOK and they will cuz I live with one of them and I'll be there good good all right I thought you might be able to put up on some like uh our audio visual thing here maybe that would be kind of cool hey look dab I still want to work with you a little bit cuz this was my Baby original I just me it probably tired of both of us I'm not going to run with the project I'm just talking about in terms of calling him and uh Brenda just got back to me and she said I thought you said next month so little misunderstanding because I invited her to the bbcf2 and then Tammy said this is not a good month to have people have her come next month to that so when I said next month I meant bbcs not paring I could see how it gets a little confusing can I you can just call her and ask her if she could do something like that how much would she charge okay I'll do that right now um so can I do um just so we're in we're in order can I make a motion that um we have Patty go on behalf of the parks and wreck board for the April 1st 2024 city council meeting to present the idea and request a budget for the mural at Morgan Street Building exactly I'm looking at Kyle to see if that's how we need to do it I mean because I have to be there for the budget I mean the whatever quarterly report yeah right yeah just do it in the quarterly report okay thank you and so okay I'll second your motion okay so if that's enough on the mural list we can move on to six and seven and8 any problems moving on and we're all in agreement so it's 40 yep okay sorry okay um beautification ideas I didn't just when I volunteered to be on the parts and wck I think my idea of it was different than what it was when I got on here because I was thinking more of the beautification like working with you guys um planting flowers or whatever and that kind of thing more about the parks than the wreck part I guess or the entertainment part so what I was thinking and and Kyle kind of answered this beautification ideas was maybe planting flowers in the medians and in front of each of the parking lots where the it has palm trees and a couple of shrubs and mulch but and then the median that's the same kind of thing but again just cop copycatting somebody every time I drive three Largo it's just beautiful where they're doing all that ginormous building all those flowers there yeah each one is by somebody else SP the little signs sponsored each probably every 20 ft is a new little sign that's sponsored by somebody so you know can we do something like that although you've already answered it the adoptor park is that what that would be that's what we would use um I can tell you in Largo I saw whoever did that program they had one contract to do it all and they must have donations right it wasn't like they had people out there right um they're a lot bigger than we are but I think I mean who are you thinking of adopting well me personally I I said last year when Tammy was talking about it when I thought it was part of the foundation I was going to ask to do 19th Street just because that's where I live and I was just going to add couple bags of mulch but I mean I just told Aaron his guys are doing a phenomenal job yeah everything looks beautiful yes I don't know if he set everything up to look Google right before our surveys no I'm just kidding it was it just really looks nice I just love that pop of the flowers I know it looks real nice you know and we had ours are such small areas that I it would be easy to do for a very minimal amount and especially if you get something like and I'm not a flower person along but vinas they like to multiply very easily so and they bloom all year round okay you know a lot more right now than they do in the winter months but they're still blooming at least all of mine in my backyard do are um the ones they put up here are annuals though right annuals y mhm so that's why I was saying the vinka is not annual it's Prim mhm okay well we have money we do have golf Medan plant money in in the budget well so so depending on what the cost that would be if you want to make a recommendation would that be like in front of the need recommend that to the board also or just in here just in here okay yeah we we already got money allocated to it in the budget and they haven't done anything with it so the medians also like the one down by my house is that indm rocks last one or does that say belir Beach your house that's IND your rocks it's IND rocks yeah cuz you just have Sixth Street on this hand there's 12th and 19th there's a meeting at 12th and 19th right I know six now and Morgan doesn't have a meeting just a crosswalk all Harrison has one okay when you say when you say median do you mean between uh the where the crosswalks are that's all I'm talking about where the cross just the crosswalks okay just the crossrock I Cu uh I I also have a question on the parking lots okay 6 12th and 19th 3 years ago when I moved here there were some followers in front of the fen that's what I just said those places too okay sorry all right so that's they Co that coincides with the entrance to right the beaches now Morgan um um what did I write something about the entrance there um maybe it needed a little more mulch but that sign yeah I got that on some perk perks perking up yeah we have that and and also uh uh Bayside Park sign is is pretty clapped out so um I you know I I know I briefly brought it up with Kyle and you know we just haven't got to that point yet to really investigate further but Bas side sign I think I showed you the photos so I mean we're we're on it I didn't I didn't uh but I haven't looked at Crossman as well as you did so uh what if I can do to clean that up we will um if we can clean it up so so yeah what I wanted you guys to do is um look at the Bas side part side it's getting to the point where we need got place it but those those signs are expensive uhhuh that's a nice wood right cut in cut out it's like one of those foam you know it's like the one yeah so what's that the one you're looking at is going to be like well it's larger but it's still, yeah $3,000 something like that very expensive um so we have to have a sign because it does I think it was a stipulation of the land grant or whatever for the par but do you want to recommend replacing that sign like an nice expensive sign or do would you want to pass dowr to something that serves the same purpose that isn't when you see it closer it's it's [Music] all so what's bad about it is it this or just can yeah all torn up I just think just needs some paint T Paint yeah I mean I didn't look at it that closely but yeah I so you may recommend to the board about replacing this well I he asked about it I said it's a very expensive sign I thought that um because you guys are responsible for things like that you could make a recommendation of what you thought okay as far as replacement or doing something different or what okay so like here's an estimate from one sign company and this was for a um I want to give you the size of it a 6 by it's large so it's it's pretty big yeah 6X 6 by 8 or something like that you guys are all big I'm yeah anyway um it was like price on that 5,000 still like or custom work something that I'm like G ho about replacing without kind of getting a recommendation of if you think it's worth it or okay going to like some other kind of sign it's going to be cheaper but we are using um the sign company that you guys use we staying with them okay yeah this way it's and those signs even though they're expensive they're relatively insign World cheap um and they're versatile because they can form like all the different m colors they that sign is old I was getting ask you how old is it it's definitely like 15 years old at least the one at Morgan Park is the same kind this is what our sign's going to look like see how big it is though yeah it's big yeah I can't see I'm sorry bad eyes old eyes oh that's beautiful isn't that nice is it is that all the military branches military branches did you see it a yeah was good time the guys go get a true measurement of that W oh oh how they measure them all well it would be them the well the two sides will be the same the the uh Western and Eastern side will be the same but the front okay right yeah because um the woman said she could absolutely do that and she said what size so that's what Aaron were working on right now we will multitask during the so going back to my flower things the median Bayside Park can you write down what plants you would want and how many we'll price out what the cost will be yeah I mean I can price them out I can just go I would just go to Lowe's and somebody price them out you know thing oh that's no I mean cuz we might go to um the amplex which where the landscapers go and they give us a a little bit better yeah so it's going to be very nice right here nice I'm just meant to get ideas I do would we milary so on that sign there at the Bayside Park would you not want to or Would we not want to have something of comparable quality or something that kind of they do do they do kind of look alike don't they well there I think what they should do is continue with whatever look that sign has because it matches the other signs although crossman's going to come down so it doesn't have to look identical but it I I think that would be a lot cheaper it probably be like maybe $1,500 or three 2,000 I don't know two to three two to three yeah for Bay for the little one I don't think you need a big sign like that we're doing like 3 by two maybe you don't need sign like that there I agree but I think it should be kind of I mean our signage should be kind of consistent yeah that's what she saying yeah the only reason this is going to be CR purpose um is because this no I'm saying one one that cross can it be repurposed to show you guys can't really do like a rebed where was I showing you guys we can even get a smaller sign back there I mean unless there could we make a b out of a c probably so I don't think it's a must do this year though you know what I'm saying we get gray out there with some foam and just [Music] chisel I thought they were wooden I didn't no they're like a foam composite um yeah so is it kind of like the tables they last longer than a wooden wooden wood or yeah that's why last longer and that's what makes it more expensive but after so many years of being direct sunlight Dr okay okay I'm going to ask one more time about the flowers yes it but would it be like an individual if I adopt 19th Street can I buy the own flowers and can I plant them or do I you know go through you can 19 the median I just a little weary because when we did it we designed it more for the parks but we'd have to definitely want to give like some safety vests oh yeah provide some kind of MOT like some cones cuz I just definitely in the median but I'm saying about 19th Street cuz that's oh if I adopted 19th Street myself I can't do 19 I can't actually do an adoption program in 19th Street cuz it's a not the front part on the street you can't do that oh okay so we could put we could put flowers in that's not you know cuz we maintain the part but we can't do like an adoption oh okay so so I can just sneak up there at midnight and plant some flowers and nobody would know I don't think they you know if you really want to plant the flowers our sha can pump some flowers so so if we put flowers in there in front of 1912 and six it would be something it'd be something that the city would have to maintain is that is that a correct observation cuz for insurance purposes and all that stuff I mean that would make sense so obviously you'd be finding some kind of a perennial that would make sense in that space that would not be an incredible amount of work to keep you know correct keep going is that right yeah and who would who would decide something like that what kind of flowers to put there would that be the city that decides that or we decided she knows a lot about flowers take her recommendation just know I like them yeah yeah the yeah like the perals that are easy to maintain yeah we can get some butterfly plants and put there and then we could see butterflies all over the place would would we would we agree too Patty that um these beautification ideas would be uh you know if you're reviewing these parts and stuff like this these might be good observations under other and stuff like that yeah that's why I was that's why I put it in here to go right after we did the surveys if there were places that you saw that you might like something like this right and like I said that was my not intent Vision Vision when I got on Parks and wreck it was more about yeah taking care of the parks or beautifying yeah beautifying and not not maybe physically taking care of them but finding ways to make them by the way where was I welcome to Belair Beach sign where is that like do we have a welcome to b beach like everybody when you when you do when you're coming from Indian Rocks there's one and and from on the on the east side now do they have um Planters there see I think we need that like I think we need to make it prettier because yeah but they it's just kind of like some shell around it the one the one that's S I think there are some we pass and they have like these beautiful Planters like cement ones around [Music] yeah big dishes yeah just like I don't know just something prettier because we're such a cool town like it really should be pretty and then we we're the town that went off during Christmas too it looks oh I know we look like the Misfits here it's going in the budget put it in there Christmas decorations are in there right we're making got to find out making progress moving right along do you know what that's about Michael do you know what we're talking about right I mean I know about Street lighting I mean Christmas lighting okay that every town has them except us because you know Felts or cloth we have something that goes like this woohoo Christmas Merry Christmas it doesn't say Christmas well I said woohoo it's Christmas but okay whatever no it doesn't that thats says happy holidays B Bloss doesn't have lights either yeah thank you great okay thanks anything else of beautification ideas when you looked at the park stuff that you would like to do or I mean we can plant flowers in every Park but some of them just look really clean and crisp the way they are right now that's I just I like the median idea I need beautific ideas all right and along with the reports just in general okay I mean the the way we have this thing set up now is we submit our reports to the city and they compile them and put them whatever kind of record there is uh my question just as a matter of process is should we be once these reports are done let's say we set a deadline I don't know if we can do that by April or May or whatever it is like that all the reports will be done should we be uh doing having some kind of a download and and and at this meeting going through them and and having everybody getting familiar with the uh results or should we have the city do some kind of a summarization or we do what we've done which is hand them in this is what um Aaron does this is the action report this is that he compiles from all of our reports okay and what to do and when have it done deadlines Etc and I think a deadline for us having all of ours done should be first of April first of April can you have it done I can help you you according to I didn't get it done by April there's only two that you have left are the Seventh Street and Bayside right well I've got the I have the uh the accesses too I I can get it done okay um in terms of beautification would you consider reaching out to the Garden Club well John and I talked about that at um Beach cleanup one day because his wife is in the Garden Club yeah and if you like to plant why not I don't know that they do other doesn't Garden oh right I think they don't really Garden what did they do that's I I don't know that I got what they do out of that they're that's they they I don't know that they Garden okay I I think they uh they might identify right uh things that they would put in benches I think they put in some plants they put in planters uh but they're not what I would call a um there's not a lot of uh how about you give me your physicality is a goof is a goofy word it's not a real word but it's some current word that they use to they they're not a group that goes out and does stuff they get together and they talk about doing things and they spend money okay time out you just said they spend money so may I have your wife's phone number and I could call her and see if they would be willing to donate plants or I know they have plant sales or something my wife made a presentation to the club oh but she's not in the club she's not in the club she's an artist so she made a pre she's an artist why isn't she painting the bathroom yeah she's an artist yeah well she could paint it why didn't you tell us from the beginning you you hey I don't speak for my wife okay well we could call her yeah so I say give well she she's pretty busy running her deal up there I I how should I put this she's not a muralist okay all right there's that's a good way of putting it thank you do it she you know but it's not what she does okay okay she does it's not what she does all right so she's a painter but mirales is a different deal they got you've got this Ai and all I mean you know they I I say they probably got you know they do a drawing and what no okay boy would I get in trouble for that so Patty if you feel like you would like a little bit of a branch of more of a beautification type of thing would you consider maybe speaking to Largo high school or some of the Catholic high schools around and asking if they have any kids that are interested in planting and stuff like that horiculture I'm wondering if any of them has a um like Department had Shepherd's Village come by here and do and I don't know if they'd come back um was that the for the bridge cleaner no uh they did they actually helped us out quite a bit just around the city hall area um and um shepher village is a part of the Indian Rock um yeah Christian School I I don't know but um but they're all about that stuff so that might be something you might be able to reach out to uh do you guys you give them credit is that what you do that one I think that I think that Shepherd's Village does I know I mean we provide them like I just you know I send them a letter and thank you yeah you provide them the hours you work for us for three hours blah blah blah so that's just an option too okay I can certainly provide the contact information if you guys wanted to reach out to her that they're really they're great kids go ahead you oh you'll send it oh I can give to you right now if you want I'll take it down and what was the name of the school again um it's Indian Rocks IR I think it's Christian yeah s Indian Rocks Christian School oh chrisan okay um see she okay uh the gal that's in charge of it's Candice Ross and I'll give you phone number and email uh phone number is 727 504 2589 and the email is Candace at Shephard's village.com so what is Shepherd's Village Shepherd's Village is a branch off of so it's like for single mothers they uh is it like a foundation like a yeah they help like single mothers and stuff like that you learn about nonprofit yeah okay yeah I I think I see it I that's is that where they are I think so yeah yeah they're close to me well no yeah there's a way I just never store for shephard's Village shabby chic do you know shabby chic when you go um past um steak i e steak okay the little Alleyway there's a shepherd's Village Office right there where you can take donations and things to that's that is that local this area only or is that more National oh I think I thought it was just this you know somebody that's really connected is jod sherley she's really recomend the kids to do this stuff I love getting involved I love getting kids involved in community projects because it allows them to feel accomplished take responsibility and learn to nurture and live in their environment instead of destroying it like they they learn to appreciate it yeah so I like that I've always tried to get the kids involved with donating their if you guys had these kids involved the pro like the proit that would have taken our Public Works Guys hours and hours to do they hadn't done it an hour wow I mean that's amazing I mean they and they're having fun they're working hard and yeah and they're learning they're learning step of the way really great group of kids small agile just got in there cre this huge pile I think uh the oldest one that was in there in this group was a junior high school and others were probably 8th grade 8th nth so like 8 to TW yeah yeah so teenage good perfect you you should see the pile that they put together it's a monster giant a couple hours yeah and it was from cleaning up that was from taking yeah I me I Tak guys all day to do what they did and how many did you have how many kids do you know oh gosh uh there's 17 I think that show M and female yep okay okay and they're supervised um you know they had what four um well what two staff members I believe that maybe two volunteers that assisted like uh what they call those people shs thank you yeah but then so yeah they're they're great I thought they did a phenomenal job and I'm excited for them to come back next year so they would get you know I mean so yeah you could like pictures right do a little team kids once a month or something to go plant with you since you like to do it got you they could do Beach cleanup yeah that's what we got you for John huh that's what we got you for it's really a shame that only four people are showing up I know and I mean it's not good so what is I I posted on everything I posted twice I posted the week before I posted the week of so like what nobody's coming is it posted on the our sign out here yes yeah Beach cleaner y every time no is it I don't know like I don't know what to say I what it's been it's been kind of going down for a number of years I'm not sure what I'm not sure I think I've been doing it for I don't know couple years hav go I so I got go and um it just seemed like we used to get more people out there and I don't know I'm not sure exactly why to me it seems like you know I don't know not sure I mean people love the community so I don't understand maybe it's too early 8: on Saturday morning it's early it's early and I'll tell you something else there's still a lot of animosity in this town about what side of the beach people would be willing to touch and not touch because they're still upset with Bel Air Shores you still have a lot of controversy in this town so I could see maybe why you not you're not getting the turnout like you used to years ago people are mad they don't want to have to clean the beaches because we're not allowed on their beaches and stuff so we can always just go north I know I know go anytime you want they don't own the beach okay no but I mean if they're if they feel the way Dev is talking about but so anyway speaking of beach clean up you're April are you ready for April 6 of course I okay Michael you're May is that okay by you y because I am out of town both of those days so am I and I was really worried about not being here but well I only thing I got to worry about is we're showing up with dut holes I already talked to both of the deputies how did those donut holes turn out that I got you you got to go to Dunkin Donuts and get wait munkin uh the deputy scanned the uh the ingredients we determined the police invol that they were they were they were they were essentially a toxic they're exerts material covered in sugar okay so they went tast things I can order I can do order D Donuts dut and I'll be there I'll get the things somebody can call on the night the day before like you used to I no it's not a big deal we don't need ice nobody cares about cold water okay just come up here water talked about last you don't need water well yeah it is nice to offer water at the end of yeah because it's kind of hot after I know you get up at 5:00 in the morning I'll stop at Publix and get the water L is that big of a deal water takes a couple minutes so you know but I think on that deal we should be my personal opinion it's a it's a project but you know we have those signin sheets for two or three years okay you know we put them into a deal like this and we know we we send out 10 which probably 30 40 50 60 names over the last two or three years off those lists so give me the list I keep telling everyone I'll inut the stuff we'll give it to Renee can we get we should do it can we do that yeah Aaron's got about I don't know a years worth of list and I got one before that go back three years for What on the beach clean up sign in sheets okay the trick is just going to be reading the handwriting but I think you were supposed to print and sign I don't know that people do that but do that and you know and say we can't you know we can't send out if we'd get just a couple of people out there you know what I'm saying so take the list cre created offically a beach clean up mailing list because like my mom lives on [Music] little and if you can let us Advance we just go masks on and we'll we'll kick the door down and we well have done that I have done that entire sorry Rene well it's just a reminder I don't justy I know okay guys all back together too many individual conversations all right so now we are and I just closed my agenda um yeah anything else other business uh yeah I'm still I'm still not entirely clear on if we do put these uh so am I right if I come along and say we should put some flowers in front of the uh the beach accesses or something like that just something you put up and then the city just goes and does it any need a budg I mean I'll be honest what I look at um I look at what I've been looking at I'm told otherwise of course if I my boss tells me we're doing it we're doing it um I look at what is like if it's a safety issue like like for instance like the crack finish I need to go look at that and see that's something that we need to fix and take care of um could you epoxy that maybe I still have to go okay so those are like my priorities like the the tree roots that was a priority we got done right away um when it comes like the shell and all that yes we can do cuz we have shell I just got to look at my budget for you know flowers then I got to figure out you know maintaining those flowers or what you know using that example um and whether or not that's going to be a good fit for like doing the edging and the blowing and the lawn mowing and and so I just got to make sure it works at that makig sense yeah we don't we want to put some in not doesn't take a whole lot of for sure a lot work right right and we can't do it KY said we really can't do it in front of the parking lots because it's B A Shores we can you can and the median between the sidewalk it have to just be done by the city out of part of our maintenance program okay right it be an adoption program yeah we I I have no problem with this we'd like to do this whenever you can get around to it would be you know marvelous that's just be that would just be my observation um oh anyway next meeting and time and date so let's pick a next meeting date and time oh I did have one other thing I was waiting for John to finish if you don't mind um the other night I went to seaweed and they had an organization there that um provides information about child trafficking so what they do is they come to your community and if you choose to do some type of Community Information Center if we just want to like have one meeting one afternoon on child trafficking there was a lot of really good information that they give you like how to protect your grandchildren and your children and everything but it was just more of um they just wanted to come in inform towns more or less communities of really what's going on with child trafficking it's not a great subject but like did you ever think about maybe occasionally doing like informational type of not so much like like um the health and wellness but like I don't know like maybe I think it's good to mix it up I 100% believe in that and I think that's a great idea I really do um there too much of it going on and you know like you were saying what to look for I mean you know I think that's a great idea you do like so maybe we could put some notice out like we're think you know not that we're thinking maybe you know we we choose a date we choose a time I'll speak I met with the like one of the chairman and I spoke to her in detail about me working on the two boards wanting to bring it over and she said they would love like that's what they're there for they would love to do that okay and like I don't know maybe like once a quarter we could do like I don't know a seminar or something maybe like do I don't know a retirement seminar or something on like we can maybe get speakers yeah Medicare or I could have hospice coming and you know speak to or pelis County and speak to people like the people I felt like they really missed during that health and wellness that I brought in all these I I like that idea because about no one knows this I don't think you knows this but about 7 months ago I started my application for operation underground that organization oh you did didn't you no oh um that that deals with that stuff to yeah so yeah H I might like to get involved in that operation underground operation underground you we won't lose you to that no no no no no it's it's all yeah they were just um advertising what they do there they were just giving pamphlets out to the public like to listen to their Spiel they would like raffling I didn't do any of that I didn't care but I just took all of her information which I brought home and okay but you're saying do like as Aaron took your idea like maybe once a quarter having an info type meeting and that could maybe be our first one so and then at that meeting maybe we could put out something that says our next meeting is this or did you like this what other meetings would you like to see and you know our next planned one we're considering this we can hand it out there can I can can I make a motion on that kind of thing I move that we put that idea in play okay I like it I second it it's okay so we are and you're going to work on the bathroom first and we can look at dates yay I'm so excited see I waited and I have another question for Kyle when is the um yard sale thingy uh second Saturday of April of April

2:00 works for me two is good you just like I said tell me I'll do okay yes ma'am so April 25 2:00 so who's who's moving who's cheing I moved it we do that I'll second it Michael okay um oh can I make another mini quick motion maybe he doesn't need a motion um I think what we you should do is try to stay on top of communicating with each other through Renee so let's not wait the whole month if we're figuring stuff out and we're moving forward let's communicate a little bit with her and ask her to distribute it that sounds great is that okay is that g to the clerk yeah she has recorded on everything yeah okay that's fine so with the protocol as you contact her and she I'd like to is distributed to the rest of the group and that's that's the program yep okay yeah just don't get in any kind of side conversation with each other right about anything so like when I sent all my reports this time I emailed Renee and I CC both of them and I did the same thing with my photos they didn't need to see them you didn't they they just do it and then they combine it all and we get it spit back out okay one I guess one last observation of Patty on the B Beach Garden Club okay I did not learn a lot about what exactly they do I I know Linda mint real well and I know she's on it I know Linda Mintz and she is on it so I can just call her and talk to her about it that would be that would be we should to me it seems like we should have a l on with them I mean they should know that we have you know talking about having plantings and stuff like that and maybe in some of these parts they want to do something like you know up here maybe they just don't have a purpose maybe if we gave them projects they'd be happy with it so I'll talk to her about that that's why I say I did not get a good feel I was I was focused on my wife's presentation is not working it makes one of these are so as you see we got we got FEMA coming we got Mike Clay we got County Emergency Management management and then we got insurance I'll be there we got erand there yeah I'll be there so we're going to get some pizza oh really some and yeah we'll be Excell with the fire department a little bit be there jackets 6:30 so we're done oh did did we adjourn you didn't no I'm wait I can't make that motion I don't think why not you can make a motion um to adjourn the meeting okay I'm ready to stop talking let's adjourn the meeting I'm move that we adjourn time is 3:24 I'll second it thank you and we're"
