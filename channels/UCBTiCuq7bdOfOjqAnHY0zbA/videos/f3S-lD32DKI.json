    "transcript": "there are standards out there that we can probably tap into and understand what like like you have in your caveat at the bottom of your uh your mailers to the residence saying hey you know just just for your own information and warning you know this is becomes a public record the the the concern was always cracking that code because i think people were fearful of giving their personal contact information and it just goes out to vendors and marketeers and that sort of thing so we didn't come up with any epiphanies or ways to crack the code on that no i i don't think so i think you're you're equating the city's stuff they're sending out to marketing things when the city is not shall i say marketing quote unquote we are providing information and those i think are two different aspects of communication does that make sense yeah yeah no i i understand completely and and probably you know the vast majority of what goes out we'll just be hey one-sided information we don't care but maybe there will be surveys or you're going to ask for feedback on things or i i don't know but maybe there will be times when you're going to put information out there and ask for some sort of response or try to get some sort of feedback on how successful you've been i mean maybe even the first time around it might just be as simple as hey you know just click reply if you receive this or something just to know what kind of response or effectiveness you're getting on we got your email right or something there you go did this go to who we we thought it was going to and item last for me is just basically what's the next step is the city manager going to take this on as an action item for what's the next step on implementing it come to the council with a recommendation and a budget and a timeline that sort of thing we did put um funds in the budget for the next coming fiscal year and uh i would assume we would uh discuss this a little further at a work session to kind of drill down on the report so we can move forward with the action items that we need to start with mainly the the survey to get that data going at least hey this is a great first step forward and a foundation on leaping off for better communications with the residents and the community in general so uh great job uh let's see any citizens comments with respect to uh communications no no one no i i think i also forgot to ask if there were any citizens comments after the sheriff's presentation anybody have any comments or questions for the sheriff's office based on his report uh we have one hand let me see stand by jane lochner great report um and i just want to say you know if if citizens do have a concern about for instance putting out their an email address a good way to do is have what i call my my bogus or bs email address that then gets forwarded to my real one on my own so that's always a suggestion but other than that it was great report yeah good stuff everybody's kind of come up with some workarounds for how to filter their email and try to keep the spam out of their important information so uh i'll leave it with that any other questions or feedback i'll back to the council for final inputs to the report if not we'll move on let's see we're going to the regular agenda at this point and the consent agenda on uh consent agenda we've got items five and six item five approval of the august third 2020 city council minutes and item six approval of the august 17 2020 city council work session minutes i hear a motion to uh cut the gender second all in favor aye aye aye motion carries into the regular agenda item seven consideration of adopting the proposed ad the lore millage rate for fiscal year 2020 through 2021. this is the first public hearing on uh setting the proposal final millage rate for fiscal year 2021. do i need to read something at this point city manager or are we just ready you uh you've got the documentation in there uh what you will need to do just to give a quick synopsis uh the staff is recommending a millage rate of 2.0394 which will produce one million one hundred and sixty four thousand three hundred five dollars in net ad valorem uh that's a fifty nine thousand dollar increase over last year the millage rate is the same as last year the increase increase is uh caused by the increased value of the property in the city that uh went from 566 million to 594 million and so you the council will have to entertain a motion to uh adopt the millage rate of 2.0394 vice mayor go ahead um council member shirley is under the attendees and she has her hand raised up i didn't notice it it's been raised for a minute because it's under the separate side um so she should be able to talk now councilmember shirley can you hear me now i don't know why i'm not seeing any i'm not seeing myself on the screen i'm not but anyway i i wanted to pull out the item five on the consent agenda i could not because i couldn't um get anyone's

clear gun can you hear me um i am back in front of my computer now i'm not sure though if you can hear me off of the telephone or off of the computer so i would like to join the meeting formally i've

the you cannot hear me on the um computer you're hearing me on the telephone right now so i think you just have to unmute me i just came in on the phone on the computer okay so what's your request at this point mayor would you like to take over the meeting as you're coming in and out i'll tell you what i'll retain chair at this point and as for consensus among the council members can we back up the consent agenda and uh entertain council member shirley's request to pull item five i don't have a problem with it are there any objections to that if not i'm going to back up and uh city manager reeves and city clerk if you'll back me up and keep me on the straight and narrow here so we're going back to the consent agenda and what i would like to do is at the request of council member shirley i will pull number five out of the consent agenda and move it to the regular agenda and we will make that item 7b now if that's okay with you the consent agenda consists now of only item 6 approval of the august 17 2020 city council work session minutes do i have a motion to approve the consent agenda with only item 6 in it sue me all in favor hi hi okay so we're moving to the regular agenda now and uh we are still on the original seven which is consideration of adopting the proposed ad valorem millage rate for fiscal year 2020 through 2021 and retaining the 2.0394 millage rate is that correct city manager yes do i hear motion it's moved okay okay i'll open it up for a debate or discussion anyone vice mayor can you hear me uh you're coming in with a strong echo yeah i hear that let's let's try muting the phone again maybe we're back on uh on the telephone give me a second okay i'm continuing with the regular agenda item seven consideration of adopting the proposed ad velour military for fiscal year 2020 through 21 and retaining the millage rate at 2.0394 had a motion we've had a second i've opened it up for a discussion or debate anything anyone if not i'll take it to the citizens for citizens comments hang on vice mayor i wish to be heard now whether we get this fixed or not i still want to be heard [Music] i'm talking on a telephone now we're still getting slap back echo here so um is this any better i've got you a lot a little better with no echo now are you asking to be recognized to address item seven all right obviously there's something on the computer that my connection is not um it's not taking but all right um so with regards to the budget um my position is very simple um it is a tax increase however you want to cut it and it is the dirty work being done by the increase in the ratables in the city it's still a tax increase everybody's taxes goes up based on this i cannot support that i ran against specifically raising taxes this is a tax increase and what is more important i think is that there's a number of things that this city council was presented via the um planning commission on their very extensive report and also the finance committee which were ideas for revenue increases and um and other things that the city could do to increase its revenue take um you know an example is and it's just an example there was i think 90 pages um but one example was talking about headquarters building here we have in the middle of a pandemic a headquarters building that basically houses four offices it's it's it's total waste so um you know we can do better with that piece of real estate in terms of better utilization better rentals and stuff like that this council was presented all of that and it's basically you know we haven't went anywheres with it so um i'm not going into the pockets of the taxpayers and i intend to vote against this budget and i intend to vote against the tax increase um so that's all i wanted to say on it any other council members i i think one thing that was addressed at the time was a lot of those recommendations and studies that were done by the planning and zoning board in the finance committee certainly took place before the pandemic and i think a lot of them the truth has changed and we're dealing with a lot of uncertainty right now and the time is certainly an issue of how long it would take to implement some of those changes we did accept the reports from the different uh committees and boards and we just haven't been able to figure out on how best to deal with the recommendations because again the truth is changing and we're dealing with issues that nobody had ever thought of before so i think at this point it's best to just kind of let some of those recommendations uh sit on the side at this point and let's let's see how things shake out in the future one thing is for certain uh we're dealing with some issues that uh we we we don't really have a good handle on what the future costs are going to be and so i i think the best way of dealing with this issue right now is as we have done in the past or now is to freeze the millage rate with where it was and uh accept the fact that there's going to be a little bit of an increase but that's also what goes along with the uh increase in property values and that's just take the good with the bad i guess so that's my point any any other further inputs from council members or staff before i turn it over for citizen commons dave i agree wholeheartedly with what you just said um we are in a time of uncertainty um there are many things that are against us right now we don't know what the cost of coven and uh other external factors how they're going to affect us and uh i think at this point in time it would be ridiculous to try to reduce our tax rate whenever we may very well have it reduced just because of the sales tax that's coming in so i say we move forward with this and vote yes marv did you have a question input just a comment i agree with dave um we don't know what's going to happen statewide with the taxes and with that uncertainty i feel that the decision that we've made so far we should move forward with anyone else before i turn it over for citizens comments can you hear me this is jody okay jody go ahead sorry i was raising my hand and wasn't getting a response again now she's still on the attendee assignment i'm sorry i'll log off and try again patty in a minute but um you know i i agree i like i'm not in support of uh raising taxes i was very very much against um not considering the roll back but given the um current events and unforeseen expenses that the city is going to incur because of those events um coupled with the uncertainty of how sales tax collections and that sort of thing will um affect our income i think it's unnecessary um you know unfortunately there's some events that will affect what our outlet is gonna be and we're gonna have expenses related to that okay now i agree with jody um i agree i don't want to raise taxes but with what's going on but i would also further say that i think we should all kind of make a promise that we will actively search for new avenues based on what the financial committee said and look into other options the marina the um the city hall or any other things we can think of and not just do what we have done for years and just keep going and kind of ignore opportunities so i would say let's go ahead and approve it but with the promise to really take a look and try to make a difference for the next year's budget that's it mayor manzo um okay are we getting the echo still here yes interesting um oh hang on let me bring this speaker down is that any better yes a little better it's good i can't hear but hang on let me do it this way any better can anybody hear me okay you're nodding i can't hear you guys that this is great um i've i've logged in but anyway uh i i don't agree with with pushing this down the road this is a real tax increase right now and um we knew uh since march that we have a a situation with the virus and possible decrease in tax revenues and um these reports have been out there and we it's incumbent on us for the effort that was put into them to do this work so uh and see where we could raise revenue we have been talking about trying to do something and better utilize the space at headquarters now well ever since i started and i think before so we're probably going on that i've been listening to this two two and a half years and nothing gets done nothing i mean just nothing okay so it's it's a it's a white elephant if you will it's it's it's underutilized any um any real estate company that had the utilization that we have of that building would immediately do something to try to increase it um i'm not saying that that you know there's there's all different ideas some of it was talking about renting uh sections of it out doing things i mean there's other things that can be done that's the bottom line and um and there were other ideas again not every idea that was given merits um implementation in our city some of those ideas aesthetically wouldn't work i think somebody proposed a cell tower i mean there's no way in the world i'm ever going to vote for a cell tower in the middle of bel air beach if we don't if unless it's forced upon us by the state or something but um you know what we can do as a council is to try and increase those revenues this is i think probably going on eight to ten years in a row that there's been just steady tax increases and they are exceeding the cost of living every single time okay and it doesn't sound like a lot one percent here two percent there but you know if everybody else has to live within the cost of living retirees have to live within their social security cost of living their pension cost of living we should as a city too and that's that's all i want to say so again i'm going to i'm going to vote no and i urge everyone else to join me thank you any other council members have input i would say that no one came to this council with a bigger agenda than to reduce uh and implement stronger budget controls than i did and all i would say is that it's a incremental process i think the city's made some huge strides in in examining the budget build a lot closer and i think we've kind of examined and analyzed our expenditures and our revenues and i think we're we're making gains in that and i think it's an incremental process we're going to eat this elephant a bite at a time and we're making strides but uh i think the best thing at this time is just move forward accept the ad valorem increase based on the property value increases and uh let's move forward i would i would task the city manager if if if we approve this and freeze the uh the uh millage rate then i would think we would turn right around and test the city manager that within six months you make it an action item to resurrect all of these recommendations from the boards and committees and based on the the changing truth and the new realities let's go back through them and see if we can make some improvements city clerk i'll turn it over to uh to you see if there's any citizens comments regarding uh item seven consideration of adopting the proposed advermore military yes there is um one second uh the first one is bill lusk uh yes hi thank you bill lost hibiscus drive um not opposed or uh for on the millage rate uh personally as a resident i don't think the impact is too hard to handle when you want to look at it individually but as a city i think it's a good thing i'd also like to ask though the council to just kind of be aware of some of what is being discussed for example one side of us we're talking about a slight increase property values went up keep the millage the same but the residents have just incurred another tax increase in the form of a stormwater fee others through conversation would look at maybe residents who have a marina slip and increase those rates so things start to add up uh when you're looking at the big picture and then as you go light item through this year's budget please be aware that you're actually looking at it spending money whether it's five thousand here twenty thousand there thirty thousand in another area so just please be conscious of uh of the big picture i appreciate your time and as always your hard work thank you all patty any other citizens comments yes next is jane lochner yes i my comp was very similar to bills and that and we just have a tax increase with the uh stormwater fee next is mark goldman yes thank you patty mark goldman 437 22nd street belair beach i firstly would like to start out by saying thank you to the finance committee and the council members who work so diligently on this budget it's it is not a huge amount of money as city budgets go but is a large responsibility and i think they've done an excellent job to save money where we could and allocate it where the residents really need it i think it's a little ludicrous to say that we're raising taxes if the millage rate doesn't go up because i think you can pretty much ask any resident if they would like their taxes to go down because their property value was devaluated i don't think anybody's going to raise their hand and say oh yeah i'm for that so in reality outside of the stormwater and the marina fee your property taxes are going up percentage-wise but not because the millage rate was increased because your homes are worth more money so i would urge the council to vote yes for this budget thank you and rob risberg yeah this is uh rob risberg 231 howard drive can you hear me all right loud and clear i um i agree with the the previous folks who talked about we've already had one tax increase this year with the storm war and keeping the millage rate at the same as it is definitely increases the taxes i understand what mark just said good point but if the amount of money i have to send to the city in taxes increases whether that's because of property values or not then that is a tax increase and so what i would like to hear from the council is what is the impact if we go with the rollback rate and the same amount of money the city took in for this current year it takes in for the next year what are the things that we cannot do that require us to get more money from the citizens by keeping the millage rate the same maybe it's justified and i have not had the opportunity to sit through the budget workshops and i know you guys have done this in great detail and long hours and i appreciate the work but maybe if we heard a little bit about what is the impact of going with the rollback rate what would be the impact of going at something uh more than the rollback rate but less than the current rate you know those kinds of options for us thank you any other citizens comments um one more one second no patty did you have another citizen yes one more one second trying to find them oh there we go oh it's mayor manzo is that you or is that mayor manzo june um hold on it's it's a phone call but i it's they were both on yeah vice mayor mayor manzo is call on the call-in line with a raised hand but it's unmuted oh we've got a pretty good echo uh we're gonna turn this off let's try it again any better a little bit is any better go ahead with your uh your comments okay all right vice mayor are we finished with citizen comments i don't want to step on the citizen comments i just want it to be heard well are you being called are you calling in i'm i'm confused here uh are we we're still on citizen's comments okay that's fine patty have we exhausted all of the citizens we've been through one round of counsel and then it'll come back to the council after the citizen comments are closed any other citizen comments patty no sir okay then let's bring it back to the council for last debate and discussion and uh mayor manzo you're up thank you vice mayor um everyone can hear me right i think we've got it working so when we finish this one i will i'll be happy to take back over the uh the mc duties here um but with regard to the comment that it's quote ludicrous to call this a tax increase let me explain how taxes work in about 30 seconds your taxes are based upon your millage rate which is not going up and the value of your house which is going up you multiply the two together and that's how you come up with your tax bill when you raise one side of the equation as i remember from my fourth grade multiplication the other side and the end product goes up with them it's not ludicrous it's called mathematics it is called the way taxes are done and taxes are going up and they have went up for the last i think at least there is no need to um be degrading to our citizens that make comments i'm not being degrading to the citizen i've said it's not neutral and it's being degrading okay well that's your opinion vice mayor you can rule on it how's that your intro yeah let's let's go ahead and move on with your point and keep the uh references to fourth grade mathematics out of it the the point is is that you multiply the two items together and taxes are going up and yes not only did your taxes go up or your taxes going up again for your property tax your stormwater fee which you can call it a fee if you'd like but it is still money you're sending to bel air beach that's going up for about 200 a year also for a lot of people is in excess of what their uh city tax bill actually is so you've had a huge huge take by the city this year um in terms of the city i'll call it taking money out of your pocket so absolutely i'm going to reiterate i'm not going to say it again i think i've said it enough i'm against this tax increase and it is a tax increase thank you other council members i i i will uh two points for me is uh and uh if we did do a rollback and mr riesberg had a good point and i'm i'm going to put the city manager on the in the hot seat here for just a second and off the top of your head uh city manager reads if you could just give us an idea if if you did not have that 59 000 increase because of uh the frozen millage rate what would fall off our budget plan well i i think it would be infrastructure projects we'd have to reduce them because we we have no excess money with staff as you well know last year we cut a hundred plus thousand in staffing uh so there's there's not any real money anywhere unless you want to do away with some some of the infrastructure projects or reduce them and uh you know things like paving or uh s street rest well i'm paving i said uh things that do need repaired uh and you know there's we did reduce some things savings accounts for bridge uh repairs because we have the money saved for that but if we continue down that road and don't save for those then in a few years as an example for a bridge repair the city is going to be on the hook for you know 500 000 if it needs to be replaced so my position is what you would have to reduce is infrastructure you wouldn't be able to reduce any operating we've added some things cameras for city hall to make a better security program that's something new this year uh sea walls uh work that we're gonna have to do on that uh and then you know we just don't have any other expenses that i consider that unless you want to just do away with something talk to me for a second about city costs i mean is it fair to say that a service or material we we acquired a year or two ago is the same price this year or is going to be the same price next year i mean is there an incremental increase in that oh yeah that that stuff increases uh regularly uh just just uh you know we're right now we're out to a bid for uh the stormwater project on 7th street uh we just had the pre-bid meeting this morning uh incrementally over time those prices have have increased each year uh when the bids come in so uh it's it's it's just the nature that you know uh construction costs uh or improvements have costs have increased so over the period of time to do a storm water project or repaving it's going to cost more and we don't have any way of increasing that do we no no we we don't we have our sources of revenue which basically uh and and just to go you know our primary source of revenue is the ad valorem tax uh then as we we go down the list of which this year is a is another issue because of the uncertainty of the other things that we have as revenue that come in uh sales taxes uh the utility tax the the state shared revenue charges for those things that are revenues that come in for those are still in an uncertain mode at this point in time okay so i go back to my my conjecture about managing expectations we would like to provide improvements and infrastructure and services for the city and its residents and the expectation of the residents are they want to see those improvements and services and infrastructure but the question is is how do you pay for it if the residents want don't want to pay for that then then how do we provide this you don't that's the bottom line so the expectation is unless you're willing to pay for those improvements in infrastructure and services if you're not going to pay for them don't expect to receive them jody i saw your hand up just additionally there are some increased costs for services um that the sheriff's contract there are some yes service contracts that have an increase cost of living increase what have you that is out of our control and those have to be paid for and i'll reiterate again what's really swaying me is the uncertainty of some of these things we've just been delivered over the last month we don't know how that's gonna affect the city if we end up with suits that we have to fund we've got to know where that money's coming from and we certainly can't cut costs with prospective lawsuits that's a good point i mean in the agenda this evening we're dealing with increases in contracts services and what's the expectation for how we pay for these things anyone else any council members vice mayor i'm sorry i have my hand up but i saw dave gaddis he hasn't spoken so if you'll take me after everyone's had their chance to speak first i'd like that also that that whenever we uh we were elected we were handed a lot of very old problems that had not been dealt with for many years um what we're being asked to do by certain people is to get those things accomplished yet remain on the budget it got nothing done we're going to have to stick with this ad valorem tax and we're going to have to ride it through and get these jobs finished we can we can look at saving money whenever the job is done but i i've heard over and over and over especially down south all the flooding all of the problems all of the issues with streets not being paved gutters falling apart our infrastructure has issues and the the extra tax that we're being accused of which is actually a storm water fee is strictly for maintaining our current situation not for upgrading and making massive repairs so anyone to accuse us of having an extra tax disguised as a fee is just not true and there are many towns around us that are doing the exact same thing because face it we all live in flood zones whenever it rains whenever we have high tides these things happen and with if our infrastructure is not maintained uh there's damage and then no one is happy so there has to be a little give somewhere to make these things happen i would like to go ahead and speak go ahead i'm going to agree with councilmember gaddis as well as councilmember shirley and to many of the comments and information that vice mayor glenn gunn has pointed out we do have a lot of work to do and we need the money there to do it with and so i think that we should go ahead and vote for the tax military to stay the same mayor manzo i think you had your hand up yes thank you i i look back on the budget here and so we say nothing can get done i think that's a little bit misleading okay difference between last year's and this year's total total budget is 59 413 so you're talking about 59 000 if you went with the rollback rate that's what you'd have to make up now last year we never really got a good explanation but somehow the city manager wound up saving i think was it 306 000 at the end of the year and it kind of came to us in a windfall where we didn't have to tap as i always say the piggy bank okay because even this year i believe we need to we don't fund all of our capital projects with the even with this tax increase we're still dipping back if i'm not mistaken um into the into the piggy bank to do this a little bit so um who knows how much savings may come through this year last year there was no advance indication that there was going to be any savings and then lo and behold after all the budgets were passed after the tax increases were put on the citizens oh guess what we found three hundred thousand dollars we never really did figure out where that three hundred thousand was found so i'm just wondering again if we're going to go for another tax increase and it is a tax increase okay to our citizens and then oh surprise surprise we saved a couple hundred thousand dollars i'd like to know about that now because we're only the difference between this year's budget and last year's budget if i read it correctly is 59 000 and i apologize i was on the road so i didn't get a chance to open this up the way i wanted to but it looks to me like 59 413 that's certainly not enough to make your infrastructure crumble it may mean delaying a project or tapping into the piggy bank a little more or maybe sharpening that pencil and just like we found 300 000 last year find another 59 000 instead of finding it in the citizens pocket so again i'm voting no thank you very much for your consideration city manager did you want to address any of those issues no i think we we've got a very good budget i think we address those through the budget process i think the console as a whole gave their their input for what we've done we haven't increased any staffing or anything like that the staff is still committed to trying to save money uh in any way we can and uh we're not just being frivolous with any of the city's money and that's our goal at all times so uh and i think the consul is has that same commitment in general uh but if isn't it you know if we uh i'm still recommending that we keep the millage rate at 2.0394 we're we're in a a situation that we don't know what the future is going to hold and have been for six months hey mark beam we still have over a two million dollar hole that we have to fill up with some kind of money and i have to congratulate staff for finding that three hundred thousand dollars that saved us by them doing some of the work themselves uh looking at the jobs as they come in and eliminating some various things that the contractor was going to do and they looked at it again and said no we're not going to they saved money overseeing the contracts and that just shaves off 300 000 that we didn't have or could not have but they didn't do the job and that just kicks off a little bit of that two million dollars that we still have to spend on that storm water project and probably a lot more than that and i'll i'll add something else in there you've got a sea wall on 16th street park seawall that needs to be replaced that's probably going to hit us for 60 000 and some of the other city sea walls that need work so there's so much that has to be done if we don't do this tax increase and the staff doesn't do their part as they have done in the past which we never saw in past years thank god for what they're doing we'll really be in trouble so definitely we need to vote for this and just move forward and then when things change in the future we can relook at all or relook at the visit visit all these things that we talked about this past year that's all marv brings up a good point i mean just this last week we've had this sea wall issue i mean obviously it was something we were starting to pick up on our radar but i mean this this really brought it into focus when we had a sea wall collapse over there on bay shore i mean it all goes in this column headed by uncertainty uh the economy this pandemic uh issues faced by the city we're not sure i will also uh throw out there the human behavior aspect of this thing is it's this is an easier position to defend than rolling back the uh the millage rate and then next year due to a decline in the economy or whatever uncertainty uh manifests itself having to go back and increase millage rates i i don't want to be that person so i think this is a much easier much more defensible position to hold from the human behavior perspective and doing a responsible job for our citizens then a year from now having to turn around and say whoops you know we need to uh raise the millage rate by four or five percent because we're getting behind an infrastructure or we we had a infrastructure where it's ugly ahead that we had not forecasted so any other debate or are we ready to call the question ready to call the question okay cindy clark would you please uh call the roll council member aki uh city clerk just one second do i need to let me just go back and remind everybody what we're voting on here and what that issue is just for uh protocol purposes this is the regular agenda item number seven consideration of adopting the proposed ad valorem military for fiscal year 2020 to 21. this is the first public hearing on setting the proposed

for participation in the public meeting will be posted at the community center and on the city website at www com that's yes is that everything city manager yes thank you you're welcome vice mayor thank you very much for for hosting the meeting very much appreciated right just a reminder that uh item agenda item 7b i is now we we pulled out the agenda the first item out of the consent agenda and that is now uh regular agenda item 7b thank you for that so that was the next item then going to item 7b on the revised agenda which is the approval of the august 3rd 2020 city council meeting minutes correct vice mayor correct okay do we have a motion so moved and a second second thank you um vice mayor to you i'll i'll defer to a council member shirley yes thank you vice mayor um the reason i wanted to pull these minutes out is there's a mention of my name and um and mayor manzo's um statement at the closing of the um meeting and it where reference that i was witness to some conversation i just wanted to go on record that i was not witness to that conversation and i'd like that redacted or at least a comment made that i'm not i was not witness to that conversation um that for i guess i'll object to this whole uh inclusion of all this information this is certainly nothing that um was voted on we've went through the attorney general's requirements for minute taking extensively with our city clerk in the past that this is even i mean and if you're going to again if it's going to be quoted verbatim that is what was said it was not objected to at the time so my um i can't make a motion but my recommendation is that this not be included at all these are city council comments they were not voted on they're not action items and quite frankly it's actually inappropriate to include all of this level of detail and i really question the city clerk as to why this level of detail is in there okay i'll just say that i didn't um object to it at the time because it wasn't appropriate you were making the mayor was making comments i didn't think it was appropriate to step on someone's comments time so i never interject when someone's making comments and i wouldn't that's just not and council member shirley thank you that is the absolute protocol these are these comments at the end of the night are supposed to be our comments and they're not supposed to be debated they're we're not debating this but um i actually really seriously objected that if this entire page nine is here and it really shouldn't be um it's contrary to what the attorney general has required we've been down this road before no one asked at the time that verbatim comments be put into the record um i i i can't get into my reasoning as to why i think they're here because that would be against our rules but there's no reason for them to be here and um and so i i'm gonna ask that they be removed and that these minutes be redone with that redacted and be approved with that be redacted again i can't make that motion but that's what i'm asking i think this is inappropriate at this point that takes care of councilwoman shirley's issue then any um council comments any citizen uh yes dave gaddis you know i'm uh i'm a little bit gun shy of this whole document i i don't know what to do with it i don't know if it's of any value or if it's not of any value to the council or in the defense of the city i would move to table approval of these minutes yeah have a second to the motion to table these minutes table approval second second by glenn gunn um there's now discussion on the tabling only the tabling motion is up for discussion dave gaddis to you you made the motion um i i stated uh my my feelings on it i would like to go through this with a fine-tooth comb and uh take another stab at it uh in the next council meeting vice mayor and then mark beam mark b now i agree i i would like additional time to take a look at this and weigh what the issues are that's all i have council member beam i would like to see the city attorney view it and get his opinion on what we should do i agree with that i think that's a very good idea and i and i agree with the idea of tabling it um i i really want this look back at against the attorney general's um comments and why this is here this is not to be a transcript it says right in the beginning of our um of our documents and our and our uh our call to a meeting it says if you need to um it says right here if you need uh it says though i'm quoting from what it says the law does not require the city clerk to transcribe verbatim minutes therefore the applicant must make the necessary arrangements with a private reporter or private reporting firm and bear the resulting expense so i don't know again why this was done perhaps there's a good reason um it's not evident to me either so thank you um mark beam through the through the last couple years there's been instances where it has been mentioned that more information needs to be put into minutes and i believe that's why it was done but if it's not necessary to have it in there i would like to have the attorney look at it and let him decide on what's appropriate what's not appropriate whether we need it whether we don't any of your council comments before i open it up to the citizens yes i have one yes uh this is basically uh to our city clerk you have put these types of comments in many of the agenda minutes correct so i agree with council member shirley if she didn't witness that once that removed that should be the only thing removed i don't have a problem with the rest of it being in there but if the council as a whole wants the attorney to take a look at it then i'm okay with that but i just think that the council member shirley's request should be honored and that should be removed thank you glenn gunn yeah i would like to state that if if there is an error in what was transcribed and that's that it needs to be corrected but so far as whether or not it needs to be in there or not i mean that's that's not something that's really necessary it says it does not have to be it doesn't mean it can't be so for whatever reason if if it's in there and it is correctly transcribed as to what was said then that's one thing but if there's an error in or a misstatement or or something wasn't transcribed correctly then i think ms shirley has a uh a a a proper request and it should be removed but i'm not sure if it's there it's there and if it's if it's correct it's correct that for whatever reason mark i'm going to come to you i just want to interject i know what i said i said that and it was not changed at the time so you can't go back and start putting in what i should have said and i might have said it's what was said and again there's no reason for this to be here it's not something that was voted upon so i want this reconciled if it goes to the attorney if this if this motion table carries i would like i i we've already been down this road already but i want to know why this is being included here there is no reason for it and if this is going to be included you again set a precedent where other stuff is going to have to start to be included you can't do it when it's convenient or when it may not be convenient you can't play it that way then all these comments are going to start to be put in that people make at the end of the uh of the event and that's just that that's not what's required in the minutes well whether you take it out or not it's on the tape and that's something we need to remember so let's not beat this to death um anybody can refer back to the tape and see exactly what's there any other council comments before i take it to the uh citizens madam clerk is there any citizen that wishes to be heard on this this is the motion to table only not to approve the minutes it's just the motion to table no there's no raised hands uh back to the council with the last word on this is the motion to table going to um to uh dave gaddis i've i've said my piece okay i have glenn gunn's hand so i'll go glenn gunn then dave gaddis you still have the last word if you want it glenn gunn uh just one last question for uh jody shirley again i'm looking at page nine and what what was a specific portion you were referring to that uh the end of page nine um where it specifically says that um no mark goldman is um his his line is live madam clerk i'm trying to mute it okay i just want to let you know dave daddish you have the last word and then we'll call it we'll call it for vote i uh i just need more time to evaluate this and uh make my decision so i i would like to table this okay so the motion that's before the council at this point is to table the approval of the august 3rd 2020 council minutes uh and also seek advice from the city attorney regarding uh the parameters of what should and should not be included in this um and uh i believe that's that states the question correctly does it not council member gaddis correct madam clerk we please call the roll one moment council member aki council member beam aye councilmember aye council member shirley aye council member swope aye vice mayor gunn hi so the motion to table carries and there's uh because of that obviously there will be no approval of the uh august third twenty twenty minutes at this time motion is uh the approval is tabled for a future council meeting with the parameters that we established which is for the city attorney to take a look at it in light of the attorney general and any other law and also um for more information and also a check to see what was actually said against the tape and make sure it's transcribed correctly um okay that one is concluded so now we move on to item eight if i'm correct now i don't think there was any other changes to the agenda i was driving at the time but i think that was it so item 8 is the consideration of approving the city of bel air beach budget making for certain expenditures expenses capital improvements and certain indebtedness for the year beginning october 1st 2020 and ending september 30th 2021 is there a motion don't move mark b makes the motion second second that was right as well read that swope yes okay okay marv beam i say we approve this uh as it's written very satisfied with it we've all went over it a number of times i have a chance to talk to the city manager about various items i'm very satisfied with it and think we should move with it thank you other council comments i'll i'll reiterate my objection for the same reason given no need to belabor any other council comments uh any cities any citizens would like to comment madam clerk yes i have jane lochner okay too late i had my hand up for a free uh thing already you already went by did we miss you on on an item yes you did okay madame clerk uh would i'd like to hear what she had to the input on it um if necessary it could be reopened uh depending on what the the impact is don't need to reopen it was on the the minutes which have been tabled my only comment was why hearsay's allowed in those minutes okay any other questions okay no other citizen comments then on the approval of the budget we bring it back for final set of council comments any comments with uh with marv beam having the last word no no comments marv last word no i think i've set them up thank you okay so before the council is consideration of approving the city of bel air beach budget making for certain expenditures expenses capital improvements and certain indebtedness for the year beginning

on to item nine which is authorization to suspend bid requirements for replacement of stormwater pipe on belle isle avenue the description is to accept a proposal for replacement of stormwater pipe and i believe this was brought by the city manager because i don't see a council person's name or mayor or sister or sister or vice mayor um is that correct uh city manager yes mayor and console this is a a pipe that is in the city manager let me just let me just get the get a motion here and then i'll we can defer to you okay okay we have a motion to uh to bring that to the floor so moved and a second second okay uh to read a smoke for first comment i deferred to city manager lynn reeves city manager yes mayor and console this is uh a pipe project that the pipe is has failed and is uh sinking uh the roadway is is uh falling in and we got three quotes uh they ranged from uh 16 000 to 48 000. uh the company with the lowest quote was mtm and we have had experience with them on other storm water projects so uh i would recommend approval so we can get this uh repair made to the stormwater system in the amount of sixteen thousand three hundred and seventy dollars any council comments the question for the city manager i you say it's falling in i mean i look back i guess your first quote was back in july it's almost two months well a month and a half later how badly is this falling in at this point well we've we put uh gravel in the hole and and had a camera inspection of it and uh we need to get it repaired so you've stabilized it though so far right right right okay good jody shirley lynn can you just out of curiosity where about is it located on belle isle just so we can take a look uh it it's uh in the area just the bella hibiscus just south of that that's where the where the cross cross pipe is going across that we just repaired no no no no this is another pipe completely different pipe it's away from the intersection it's down the road a little bit all right thank you any other council comments madam clerk is there any citizens that wish to be heard on this there are no raised hands okay back to the council for the final word goes to read a swope i don't have anything else to add thank you lynn for the information call the question if there's no one else to who wishes to be heard so we are authorizing the city manager to suspend bid requirements for the replacement of stormwater pipe on belle isle avenue um he has indicated that he wishes us to approve the uh mtn contractors for a uh for the belle isle repair of in the amount of sixteen thousand three hundred seventy dollars did i say that correctly city manager yes mayor a yes vote will give him that authorization madam clerk please call the roll council member gavis hi council member shirley aye councilmember schwab aye councilmember aukey aye councilmember bean council member bean hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor mandel hi so it passes seven to zero city manager you're authorized uh to enter into that contract and agreement with mtn in the amount of 16 370 and get that repair done as soon as possible thank you thank you okay item 10 is to authorize the city manager to execute a contract addendum for residential single-family and multi-family residential complexes solid waste collection services this is a waste management contract addendum do i have a motion so moved rita smoke makes the motion a second second mark b makes the second to read a swope i'll defer to the city manager lynn reeves on this one city manager yes mayor and console this is part of the waste management contract they they have uh within their contract tipping fees if they increase by pinellas county that they will submit an increase to us and also they can increase our fee depending on the cpi up to four percent per year uh if you look in the backup documents uh the cpi change ended up 0.55 percent so uh we didn't have a major increase it's it's an increase of about somebody's phone's ring hello uh we had an increase of about uh 4 500 in the contract for next year and that won't cause any increase to the residents so it's it's just uh an expense that'll be washed with the current uh waste fee that we collect each month so you have you have enough room city manager in the feed right now that's what you're saying so in other words there will not be an increase even though their tipping fees went up right there will be an increase in their contract but we won't have to raise the resident rates and correct me if i'm wrong we have no say in this fee this is something that they set for us and based on our contract we have to pretty much accept it correct correct they it within their contract when they bid it they put a provision in that uh they could ask for up to a four percent uh cost of living increase and uh uh and any tipping fees that the county increases and when i talk about tipping fees if you don't understand that that's where they uh deposit they have to pay a fee when the trucks go in there to dump based on the weight city manager i i think the um i i i know with you know when it comes to the these fees that we don't have any you know any choice in the matter but they uh earlier in the year when the virus occurred the waste management people put out a letter to us saying that they um reserved the right to exercise their um you know basically the the uh requirement that you know it's an act of god and they could cut back on services i have not personally noticed any service cutbacks but i wanted to ask you publicly has there been any service cutbacks um or any kind of reduction in what they've been taking which would uh decrease the amount of tonnage and stuff that they're actually collecting no there there hasn't been any uh service cutbacks uh the only thing that i would say that's kind of been extended is because of the amount of trash uh did increase because we had a lot of people staying at home more the pickup time the trucks filled up faster and uh so they were working till right at six o'clock sometimes to get the trash out of the city on mondays and thursdays but they they didn't have any issues at all great thank you any other city glenngon i've got a couple questions uh this cpi aspect of this contract is that just boilerplate that's typically in there did when this contract went up for bid did the competitors uh bid proposal include the same sort of thing yes yes and with respect to all this controversy going on with recycling and that sort of stuff there are are we still getting our fair money's value out of you know what we're paying for recycling and where it's going as i go into the right places and we're getting the services we actually contracted for yes yes we kind we're getting uh the recycling on wednesdays that we contracted for uh i'm i'm sure they're not getting the value out of the recycling but you know from a cost perspective because of the the disposal of it uh probably has has been reduced the revenue that they might be able to collect so yeah i guess the point i was trying to make is there's been a lot of newsworthy controversy about people are paying you know we for recycling costs but it's not going where it's supposed to be going and it's just ending up in landfills and dumps anyway so you're paying for a service that isn't being followed through so my question uh was with respect to accountability that we are getting what we're paying for yes yes i would say we are okay thank you any other city council comments madam clerk are there any citizens that wish to be heard there's no raised hands thank you i come back to the city council with the last word going to read a slope i'm good with going to the vote any other council comments so before the council is an authorization to permit the city manager ask the city manager to execute a contract addendum for residential single-family and multi-family residential complexes solid waste collection services that's been attached in our packet over here um madam clerk will you please call the roll council member shirley sorry aye council member swope aye council member aki aye council member beam dad and i council member beam aye thank you councilmember gattis hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo aye so it passes seven to zero um city manager you're authorized to execute that contract addendum as presented in item 10 in our uh agenda tonight moving to item 11 captain miner is still here captain liner you're on mute by the way if you wish to be heard so just on mute please um this is item 11 is to authorize the city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2020 2021 um the description on this is the approval of the pcso agreement for law enforcement services copy of that has been attached as item 11 into our uh our agenda for tonight do i have a motion so moved second what made the motion second second second by more beam to read the swope defer to city manager lynn reeves if you have anything else to add if not i'll take the floor back no i this is the annual renewal of the contract it went up 2.6 uh from the previous year uh and the total amount is 503 808 city council comments i did one thing i do do want to mention we took out uh several things that we that the sheriff was doing as far as uh bank deposits uh delivery of uh uh console packets uh those we'll be putting in a mailbox here at city hall and you can pick them up 24 hours a day uh and uh we put in a provision to clarify about the parking enforcement on the streets and the parking lots uh for the most part uh the rest of the things in the contract and this will give the sheriff more opportunity to patrol the streets and do things like traffic and things of that nature and staff will take that uh duty in-house okay that's what i think robin i think rita said she wanted to speak after lynn so i'll let her go first she uh deferred to lynn reeves so we're gonna go through first for everybody's comment and come back to her um no i was gonna ask lynn was there any recalculation with belair shores amount remember we talked about that that since now with the umbrella ordinance sheriff's going to be spending more time um enforcing that so they should probably pay more in order to have more sheriff's time uh if you recollect the sheriff said that uh at the meeting uh that we had with the sheriff that he would have his fiscal people look at that but it would have to be done uh later in september and october he did state that so they are going to look at that they they have to if let's say they found out that wow they do spend way more time at belarus shore is there going to be any change in the amount they pay or is that going to have to go in the next round well if if we find that the the amount they pay with our share is different then uh i'm sure the sheriff and his fiscal people uh would uh adjust the contract to to to our benefit and captain liners there and i think i think he would agree with that if if that was the case it's safe to assume that you can do that perfect thank you glenn gunn uh besides tweaking the terms of the contract and the the specific things that we were tasking the sheriff to do i mean we took some things out which basically freed up some time to focus on other aspects of the contract but i had asked at one point whether or not we had benchmarked our costs for this contract against some of our neighboring municipalities the question being is it a level playing field are we are we paying similar prices yeah is there a better beach factor no it's the same price per deputy if you look at the last page uh the deputy cost of 99 and 592 is the same in other cities so it's it's no different anywhere okay and for uh captain lioner then is there are there any things that stand out that are significantly different between the work you do in baylor beach and just our adjacent neighboring municipalities i would say probably only well you were the only bank runs and stuff on like that we all cut that out uh this year's contracts i think you all saw that and adjusted that and thought their time spent better other places so that's probably those couple things we did rework are okay any other first round yes jody shirley first round yeah this is captain liner you know we do a lot of house checks i know when your guy when the deputies do them they spend a lot of time i've watched them they're very thorough is that a normal is that normal in most cities is that number of house checks normal i thought you i thought the report was there was a hundred and three hundred three hundred and something three hundred okay that's about i looked at those numbers it's about one checking a house like every other day so i mean really we don't say you have to check it every other day we don't say every week and stuff but the reason for the reason we do realistically is so you don't come back a month later and something happened or you got burglarized that's kind of the whole program so unfortunately if you do become a victim of a burglary it gives us a tighter window in which to investigate um so lynn and i thought we could push that off to where i put documentation in and say not to do it as frequently but you know there's always a trade-off so if we check it on monday and we check it again on wednesday which gives us 300 a month well then if it occurs on tuesday we have a one-day time speed we push it to a week then we get a weekly session so but there's a there's a checks and balances and and i'll go back to as i said before and this isn't necessarily related to the sheriff contract but we need to put on the next work session really spooling up the neighborhood watch i would think you know i know and my neighbors i know when they're out of town i've got one neighbor he calls me says anyone moving in or out call the police you know so pretty good you know indicate you know there's some things you can do as neighbors to be a friendly neighbor and keep an eye on it and i think if we spool up that program it would relieve the sheriff of some of those you know kind of just responsibilities day-to-day and then i can give you that contact them following i can tell you this dollar council belair beach we have a very good working relationship with the citizens because i deal with 10 10 contract cities um it seems that per capita ballard beach tends to call more often than some other cities so it's really good that when they see something they know something's out of the ordinary they call us we always say that but just seeing your citizens seem to listen a lot great thank you i have marv beamed on the first round then for second round i had rita swope and glenn gunn so that's the order so it's going to be marv beam and right i'd like to thank the sheriff uh this is a number of years ago but they did find somebody in my pool when i was in on vacation so it works i mean it really does so thank you very much for that one glad to hear from you to smoke i just want to thank uh you captain markliner and all your sheriff officers you guys do an excellent job in my opinion the reports always show minimal if anything that any kind of you know bad activity so i really appreciate your services and i'm glad that we were able to help remove a couple of things from the contract just so you can focus more on what your responsibilities in my opinion should be rather than you know delivering mail and that kind of stuff so i just want to make sure i thank you very much for all your service thank you very much vice mayor gunn yeah i just asked a question about the significant differences with our neighbor municipalities and and when uh jody shirley brought up these house checks i mean 300 plus a month i mean it that's an interesting number because if you we only have like 700 dwellings here in miller beach so we're checking half of them every month so my question is what's the demographic there is it because we have a high uh percentage of snowbirds here i mean is it if you went to largo would you have that many house checks bel air bluffs people take a lot of vacations i mean it's typically you know when they're out of town they call us and we make sure we check on their stuff while they're going the only thing i'd point out i understand you know 300 seems like a lot realistically with them so you know it they probably take about five minutes to look at all the spending hours upon hours at each house it's about a five minute check and make sure everything's locked up no i wasn't trying to drive home a point i mean i was just questioning the numbers i i think it's a great opportunity to get into the residential areas and the neighborhoods and the community so i you know i'm not questioning it i think it's a good opportunity to to make the rounds and and make a presence i was just kind of the numbers kind of hit me funny yeah thank you vice mayor just just to clarify uh i don't know what it is today but a couple weeks ago it there's actually only 22 homes on house check but if you take those numbers and you say 300 they're probably getting those 22 homes are basically getting 15 house checks a month so when you see 300 you're it's it's not 300 different houses it's only uh as it was about two weeks ago there were 22 that were active but those four yeah i guess my point was it's just i mean just essentially you're checking every other house once a month i mean that's i'm just kind of putting it into rounds yeah number one yeah i want to address captain liner captain um i've said it to mayor uh to uh sheriff galtieri last week and i'll say it again this week our odds are last uh last session when he came here and um i'll say it again uh i think the professionalism and the abilities of the sheriff's department to um to handle crime in this city is exceptional they've done an excellent job um the proof is month after month we typically um have zeros going down the major crime things uh you can't do better i mean i think there was one point we had four or maybe five or six months in a row where we had no crime i mean that is a council's dream it's a mayor's dream it's a city manager's dream so um good work from the citizens who are keeping you informed and excellent work from the people in the field so my kudos to you um i intend to uh vote to approve this and i also think later on we have a discussion to actually add more uh law enforcement it's something i've been pushing for for some of the quality of life issues because as i said to sheriff goldthier last time i think we ask a lot of one deputy sometimes you know to say you know we want you to handle speeding and we want you to handle everything else um but you know the solution may be to add more law enforcement so this is not a city that's looking to defund its police this is a city that supports its uh its sheriff's department and certainly supports the uh and is willing to put the money to keep that good level of service so great job for you and everyone in the uh sheriff's office thank you mayor we appreciate the relationship other city council comments i believe uh that we go to the uh to the citizens i believe we have not done that correct so let's go to the citizens madam clerk there's no raised hands okay we'll come back to the city uh to the city council rita swope had made this motion so she'll have the last word i don't have anything else to add any other council members i'm ready to call the question then so this is to authorize the city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021 that appeared in item 12 in our agenda packet tonight a yes vote is to approve that contract madam clerk council member slo yes council member aki aye council member beam council member shirley aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo aye so it passes seven to zero city manager you're authorized to execute the contract that appears in packet item number 12 for law enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2020 through 2021. item number 12 is to authorize the city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2021. the description on this is approval of the pinellas county sheriff sheriff's office agreement for code enforcement services do we have a motion so move mark b makes the motion do we have a second second i think that was rita swope so mark beam and rita swope um mark beam to you the city manager gave us three options on the page and i would suggest the council look at option number two as a favorable option any other city council comments god glengon i'm sorry didn't see your hand there i think we're talking about the same one are we putting the two together the the city manager's recommendations and options with this contract or are we talking about just approving this right now this is to approve the contract i i don't i'm not quite sure i saw what council member beam was referencing here the the question before us and that's been motioned is to authorize for the execution of the contract yes mayor what what i did is i looked at the the options leaving the contract with the the sheriff doing 100 of the code enforcement or doing a mixed uh situation uh with the sheriff's office doing part of the code enforcement but using the rest of the contract for uh traffic operations on holiday and weekends that the consul has you know brought up several times but the contract would still be approved as a contract i'm just giving you some options to how we utilize this contract understood glenn i have you next but i just want to say so what's before us now is not those options it's to approve the contract i believe if i get you correct city manager you'll we'll probably have a secondary discussion at some point whether option one two or three is the desirable one for the council yes yes okay glenngon to you so my question i i've got two questions so can we amend this or cancel it at a at any future date if necessary if our requirements or needs change yeah we can we can utilize the number of hours that we need to utilize we can reduce it uh and captain liner can clarify but my understanding is i can use one hour a week if i wanted to or i could use 16 hours a week and i could say okay i want you to do five hours of code enforcement and ten hours of something else or none vice mayor to answer your question 60-day kick out on the 60 days notice and you could be out of the contract by either party okay so my follow-on question then is would we be better served if if we reworded this or amended the contract to say something along the lines of code enforcement services and supplemental duties to be as directed by the city manager to provide that flexibility or are we kind of nailed down to this code enforcement thing do we need to put some language in there that gives us the ability to to be flexible with the city manager's options for hey maybe i i don't want to use a hundred percent of this uh officer's time for code enforcement i'm going to go ahead and give go ahead and have him out on doing traffic patrol or manual light manipulation 25 of the time traffic control that sort of thing [Music] vice mayor if if i might toss my two cents in this this term goes from october 1st 2020. so if we want to have continuity i think we have to go with the contract that we have now in my opinion and then if you if we wish to make this change i mean we wouldn't be meeting on this most likely and and resolving it until november any odds or october anyway as a council um that would be our next official session unless we had an emergency session or a special session so um it would give us plenty of time to utilize the 60 days but i think to try and amend the contract on the fly right now i think that'll probably give fred gray hairs um i'm not sure but i think this would be difficult to to try and amend this right now so um that that's that's my point i'll i i the city attorney wishes to be heard and i'm gonna i'm gonna call on him if he'll address this well i'm just looking at paragraph six of the contract and it says that the part-time community policing deputy slash code enforcement who shall be provided on an as needed basis so as needed gives the next sentence says the specific hours of work of this community policing deputy shall be determined by his or her supervisor after consultation with the city manager so to me those two sentences give uh lynn and the sheriff's department the flexibility that you're talking about captain claire would you agree with that yeah yeah i know though this one here is for code enforcement um so and you're right obviously it's if you don't use all the hours you obviously save money and stuff like so we kept it very flexible to say you're not locking into 20 hours a week you're not walking into one hour a week so let's say you decided to cut back and you save money um the only question i have on this this is the contract for code enforcement um typically what we do is we have a law enforcement contract we have a code enforcement contracts and then we have secondary employment for special details that would be special events and traffic the only reason i would have to see how the sheriff would want to handle there's two different rates your code enforcement is 47.88 an hour special detail rate i think it's 55 now so i don't know if we can use code enforcement i think we'd be able to use code enforcement for traffic enforcement but i don't want to tell you that 100 and then i kick you to a 55 rate that makes sense so right now this is a code enforcement contract um and you determine how many hours weekly and then if you save money you can do whatever you want with those money the question outlining is can we use you can do it so i don't i just have to check with the sheriff i don't think you have a protection blane gunn you had a question no i was just thinking you know obviously there's a concern here does this need to be tabled or do we want to move forward and approve this one and then come back and change it and this would keep your code as is now with that flexibility so so you could determine the hours and then if down the road you wanted extra let's say traffic enforcement then we would have to have the discussion is that an addendum to the contract um or is that a secondary employment contract but right now if you prove this as is you would be able to go with either option one or option two um because you have the flexibility in your hours but that's for you to decide we'll do whatever you want correct me if i'm wrong captain the contract our current contract is going to expire september 30th so if we table this and this doesn't get heard we're going to have no code enforcement from the sheriff's office correct there's provisions in there where the contract will continue and then the sheriff's just not going to leave you all hanging so if you needed more time to discuss stuff than that i think you'd be amicable continuing as is without the contract in place mayor and consul i think you can you know you're just approving the contract going forward if we need to modify it that's just an addendum because we're still going to use their services so uh we we can control that with an addendum and if if we decide to do an addendum in november or december we can do that uh and modify the contract any way we want but going forward i would recommend that we go ahead and approve the contract as it is for the next fiscal year uh we have the funding budgeted what we use it for will be up to the city council uh you know in the future glenn i'm going to come to you but i just have a question for captain liner on something he said and i'm looking at i don't have this year's contract in front of me but i'm pretty much assuming that it's pretty much the same thing and i look at item 12 and it says this term it says this agreement shall take effect on the first day of october 2020. i bet last year said october 19 2019 and shall continue in effect through september 30th 2021 i don't see any provision for going month to month so again i continuity is important to me and i want to make sure we have it i agree with the city manager i think we need to uh approve this contract and then come back to it circle back around when we have a better understanding of how we want to utilize the hours right in addendum whatever we need to do that that's another council discussion um i have glenn gund and jody shirley yeah i was just going to say i agree with city manager approve this now the workaround is you can reduce hours and put that money aside in a pot and come up with another contract for the other services at the 55 array if necessary but no i understand and agree with city manager let's move forward and prove this as is councilwoman shirley yeah glenn you're saying almost exactly what i was gonna say i think that this contract gets approved we use the hours as we see fit maybe we don't have to fulfill the uh hours that we've you know we use them as we need to i know the sheriff told us he can provide us deputies whenever we need them at that 50 rate i think we you know figure that out when we need to when we need extra coverage we use um you know we talked to the sheriff about those items and uh move forward with this contract and if we don't fulfill the entire 37 000 that it is listed on there then that money just goes in the pot for directed patrol at a later date any other city council comments captain leiner did you have any other comments before we take it to these citizens thank you madam clerk any citizens wish to be heard there are no raised hands i'll come back to the council marv beam you have the last word well i think we should move forward with the contract and then consider um utilizing the option to the way the city manager would like to if we don't use code enforcement uh 100 we can take that money and use it where we need it okay thank you um i'm going to close comments and at this point call the question so this is before the council is the question to authorize the city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2020 through 2021 that contract appears in item 12 of our agenda packet a yes vote was is to authorize the approval madam clerk council member aki yes council member bean aye councilmember gavis aye council member shirley aye council member swope aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo aye so it passes seven to zero city manager you are authorized to execute the contract for code enforcement services as appears at item 12 for the fiscal year 2020 through 2021 thank you thank you okay we moved to item is everybody okay we're at 817 does anybody need any breaks or anything we'll forge ahead here item 13 is the authorization to execute a revised agreement with the city attorney and this is approval of a revised agreement with city attorney fred reilly i see no council members names here so i'm assuming this was brought by city manager reeves correct uh this was brought at the uh consensus of the consul to uh from the work session okay okay fine um so we'll note that it came as consensus of the council from the work session do we have a motion yeah i think it's self-explanatory we beat it to death at the work session i um read through the contract it looks acceptable i uh would say that we should move forward with getting it approved uh glenn gunn the the wording in paragraph three uh i mean the whole emphasis was to make sure the city manager is fully in the loop does this wording cover the the action or the situation whereby we have a council meeting and the consensus of the council is to move forward and give the city attorney some direction or action item i mean it is that covered in there or does there need to be specific boarding city manager and city council there there is a statement that says in the very last sentence including when a request is directed by the to the attorney from the bel air beach city council while in public session i think i i i just didn't know if that word only uh negated that or mitigated it in any shape or form if that's the case i'm i'm good to go and council comments i would like to make a comment i i i've cautioned against this language and um i think upon some research i think uh the caution is probably um very well grounded um i've not discussed this with fred reilly i'm bringing this on right now and i'm going to ask him ultimately his determination i guess who wrote paragraph three was that was that mr reilly or mr reeves what i did i did some revisions and then i sent it to fred to review and make comments so a joint effort so here's my issue okay the city charter says that all powers of the city shall be vested in the city council except as otherwise provided by law or those powers specifically given to the charter officers or specially reserved to this charter by the electors of the city what paragraph three effectively does is filter all requests for legal services through the city manager and that i believe is in direct conflict with section 4.06 of the charter which mandates that the city attorney quote shall advise the city council and the city manager on all legal manners matters so what's happening here is the city attorney is is um advising the city manager only and he becomes the filter or the choke point for the city council and i don't believe that fred riley as an attorney who represents the entity the entity being bel air beach and us being the elected officials of bellar beach can represent the entity through um a go-between um i don't think it's efficient i don't think it's the right way to do things and i think it may be in conflict with this charter so um and that would be obviously a major problem so with that um i'm going to ask the city attorney uh for his opinion and if this is acceptable for him both by way of the city charter and also by way of work um as an attorney to fulfill the requirements that he served the client which is bel air beach thank you city tourney i'm asking you directly for your uh for your thoughts on that what i just said okay well my thoughts are one my uh work and my the authority that i uh use needs to be consistent with the charter of course i also need clarity about what who who is supposed to be directing me and you know over the course of the last year that i i will say has been a topic of some degree of friction um having said that i as mayor manzo said i do represent the collegial body which means the elected officials are the collegial body as a group and one of the things that is imperative to me and to any other attorney is to be able to have a direct line of communication with the client and you seven are collectively the client and of course i'm supposed to also work with the city manager i feel like i've worked with the city manager very well over the course of the last year the the thing that concerns me at times is that i have gotten the vibe that the city council members are afraid to talk to me or are guarded at times about talking to me and in order to to do the job that i have and fulfill my role it is imperative to me and any other attorney that there be a basis for a a two-way uh conversation and that that's typical in any attorney-client relationship and it should simply be present here so the you know am i is this language acceptable to me it's acceptable to me with the caveat that i'm going to um communicate with these seven members of the city council and have an open dialogue on those instances when it's necessary i mean one one thing i know i have not done is uh simply call seven people and you know talk endlessly about the same thing seven different times i've been very uh limited in in the the times i've reached out to y'all and you all been for the most part pretty limited on the times you have reached out to me but i just want a better situation because it's it's caused me some degree of discomfort especially the last couple months because i have done exactly what the contract authorized me to do and there's been uh you know unhappy comments for me doing what the the contract require authorize i simply want to clarify city council glenn gunn and then jody shirley how would you reconcile you know i i understand all this and you know that relationship needs to exist but how do you reconcile the issue where the only person who can obligate city funds is the city manager so if a if any other individual besides the city manager should pick the phone or email you and something comes up where it's a billable issue that person has just de facto obligated city funds so i mean is there some sort of conflict here that needs to be resolved or how do you reconcile that i i understand completely what you're saying and it needs to you need to have that ability to pick up the phone and talk to the sergey attorney but at what point does it become hey you know this is a a public issue or a forum and oh by the way i need to start some billable hours on this thing because it's it's more than just a uh a simple yes or no or let me think about that or whatever where where does it cross those boundaries well i mean one one way i reconcile a lot of things is if each of you each of the seven of you have some obligation to communicate with me if you become aware of something that you feel i need to be aware of and i mean there are circumstances where it goes the other way as well i mean if there's something that i become aware of that one or all of you need to be aware of i want to be able to act on it and you know most things i will say don't need to be acted on five minutes from now most things i mean you you have predictable um situations and i mean a lot of the stuff that i work with lynn owen is very simple it's very straightforward um any given week he sends me a contract a document or something and it simply says please review this and let me you know give me your feedback and that's very straightforward but there are um there are things that periodically will come up that i you know i i as the attorney need to be um free to talk to whoever i need to talk to and i would hope there's some level of trust in doing that i mean one of the things i told y'all when i uh applied for and interviewed for this job is that my billing records would be extremely detailed and they have been and they've been down to the minute and there's one thing that i'm i'm torn about how i'm going to handle it but um i will tell you there's a a lot of time that i spend on stuff related to the city of bel air beach that i spend time on and it's billable time except i don't bill you for it and you know i i think i better start putting those in the bill and putting them as a zero amount because what what i don't want to do is have me call council person a and then at the next meeting have council member b come raise an issue and ask why am i you know why is there a charge for x number of dollars for me talking to council person a that that's a dynamic that you know i i will tell you i can't live with and because it it tremend tremendously uh narrows my ability to do my role councilwoman shirley yeah i think this is one of those unforeseen consequences where we're looking at this and trying to um i think corral council members so that there's not abuse of of legal services and driving the bills and you know and i think that your detailed billing mr riley has probably brought light to um the amount of time spent with you know on some situations i you know i don't know um you know i think the the the reason we talked about this was because we're trying to avoid the abuse of services how do we overcome that i don't know you know i think that the mayor brings up some good points clearly you know we do have to have the freedom to uh reach out to you and vice versa so um but i don't know how we keep everyone in check and not abusing that well i i don't mean to interrupt you no please go ahead well i was going to say that the i wouldn't torment abuse i would would torment that there are simply times that um in in order to uh solve problems hopefully you're able to solve them in advance one of the concerns and i i listened to the workshop from july and i told you before i wasn't particularly uh thrilled with the the comments at the workshop but i fully understand one thing the seven of you have the obligation to set a budget and you have to address all sorts of budgetary issues and you work long and hard on doing that and if something uh flares beyond the budget uh ceiling that you send set then that is cause for concern i fully recognize that and i i will tell you over the course of the last year i've done a lot more things that i really didn't anticipate i would be doing but they were also uh asked of me and they were asked in a manner that was consistent with the contract and i did them and then i documented them except for the ones that i you know simply didn't put on the bill and i again will assure you there was a lot of that so i i don't have a great answer my real answer is y'all the seven of y'all need to be a coordinate better and that's a very difficult task because you have to comply with the sunshine ball and it's very difficult yet that's one of the things in the workshops and the meetings that y'all need to thoroughly flesh out the the work level is consistent with the budget and you don't have overruns i'm going i'm glad i'm going to come to you i want to also react to something that councilman shirley said although she didn't mention a name to the extent that word abuse is out there i take complete issue with that word um to the extent that i used mr riley's services and any of that might be directed at me and i'm not saying any of it was directed at me um i don't abuse city attorney services um anything that i was doing with the city attorney was for the benefit of the city i don't need legal advice there was no that was not directed towards anyone thank you and i didn't say it was but there was the word abuse and that's a bad word that's a bad word this isn't a debate i'm speaking any of us could abuse it i'm not okay right and and to the extent that someone's abusing it is one thing and i'm totally in favor of reigning in abuse but if you want to look at legal expenses and what they were spent on then let's take a particular issue and let's have that issue you want to discuss a records request we'll go through and give you every document that's out it's not on topic right this is not on topic the word abuse is the wrong word no one should be making that accusation about anybody on this council and if you have abuse then come forward with it come forward with it so um mr riley i agree with you abuse is a very bad choice of words to be using on any individual here um and it doesn't matter to me whether we limit this or not limit it if you want to cut it out and put everything through the city manager go ahead i believe you're in violation of your charter and since we can't speak to the city attorney on that that leaves other issues then because how do we deal with a council that might be running afoul of its charter so i don't know glenn gunn then marv beam you know besides the the aspect of uh obligating city finances all of this banter about hey who's the blame or abuse or whatever conspiracy theory let's put that all aside and the way you do this is the professional courtesy of everything goes through the city manager the this council cannot come together in a public forum every day of the week to discuss issues but i think one of the one of the roles that the city manager plays is as kind of the referee and the traffic director and all of this stuff and you know sunshine has been hammered into our heads since day one and this is exactly what we're talking about if you want to get rid of all the conspiracy theory all of the innuendo all all the issues about he said she said then this is the way you do it the city manager acts as a traffic cop and a referee in this stuff and as a professional courtesy he has the 360 degree view of what's going on around here and if it's important enough that it needs to be talked about to the city attorney then the city manager should have some visibility on it and hey that's what this sunshine stuff's all about we take it all with the warts and hair in all of our business and there's nothing that should be going on that shouldn't be discussed in this this collective forum here so this is how you do it i would like to speak after mark beam arf being denrita i think we should all have um contact with the city attorney but just simple call the city manager first say hey i've got an issue i'm going to call the city attorney that's it let's not stop anybody from talking to the city attorney but just go through the city manager simple simple as that this way he knows what we're doing and uh he may have an answer who knows unless it's something private well that's another issue that would have to be determined later but i think we should start doing that i don't see a problem in it does anybody else read a smoke is next i would like to say that i think we should stick with everything going through the city manager if we need to discuss something it can be discussed during these council meetings the work sessions we can direct the city attorney at that time if he has any feedback or information to provide he could provide it at that time that way we keep everything going through our city manager because we've got too many other parties contacting our city attorney and we're supposed to be a council of seven not a council of one two three whatever so i just really feel like it needs to go through the city manager to control it if the city manager can't answer our questions at the time he can contact the city attorney if the city attorney needs to consult or talk with anybody else i know you had mentioned in the last meeting that you consult a number of times with the mayor since he's also an attorney i think we should look at an outside attorney for that consultant rather than keeping it in house because we need to keep everything on the straight and narrow and i just really prefer everything go through our city manager and then he can take it to our city attorney fred reilly and then dave gaddis well i didn't mean to jump in front of dave dave do you want to go first and then come back to fred riley yeah i think everyone needs to rewind a little bit and remember why uh this contract we wanted it changed uh we wanted it changed because i'm not going to say anyone is an abuser but collectively we were abusing our authority to contact uh the city attorney it basically in the in the current environment uh being able to pick up the phone and run up the bill at anyone's uh anytime there's any type of an issue it creates doubt and uh uh and issues uh between the council itself and uh um although i enjoyed the luxury of of contacting mr riley directly uh whenever i felt like i had something that i that needed to be discussed i am willing to forfeit uh that right uh so that everyone is on the same page and uh as glenn referred to it in that meeting we're not working inside a bubble fred reilly well i i want to follow up on something that marv beam said and that is um having everything go through the city manager is fine except there are inevitably going to be situations where um i will need to talk to one of the seven of you and again i am need to i need to be able to do that and um there have been times and and i will just say this is a a generic statement if any of the seven of you asked me to hold a discussion and confidence then i'm about you know it's as a lawyer i'm bound to do that i'm obligated to do it ethically and i've done that and you know one of the things i this this is a a different topic but i'm going to use the opportunity to point it out i would ask that each of the seven of you look at the memo i sent you yesterday and read carefully the rule that i enclose included which is rule 4 dash 1.13 that relates to what my obligation is in ethical obligation according to florida bar rules to work with a organization as the client and i have applied that rule over and over and over again throughout the course of the last year and i will inevitably apply it again or numerous times in the coming year but it it's imperative that i or any other lawyer be able to have a uh discussion with a confidential discussion at times with a client and you know i'm fine with working with through lynn with the caveat that you know there are things that i'm going to have to discuss at other times i i'm not going to be a person that abuses it either if if i was abusing it your bills would be about twice what they are i'm i'm extremely sensitive to the time and i've again just telling you very plainly i have written off quite a few things over the course of the year and i've done that for the the benefit of the representing the organization and hopefully diffusing and solving some problems patty i'd like the following two sentences read uh are put into the record on my um on my objection to this motion as being against the charter section two point and this star it would start from here section 2.045 b number one says quote all powers of the city shall be vested in the city council except as otherwise provided by law or those powers specifically given to the charter of officers or specifically reserved by this charter to the electors of the city end quote my take on that is that nowhere's in the charter makes the city manager the gatekeeper of legal my second thing that i would like to add in and i quote section 4.06 and i'm going to only quote the appropriate part quote the city attorney quote shall advise the city council and the city manager on all legal matters it means that the city and again end quote in my interpretation it means that the city uh attorney must and shall advise both the city council and the city manager does not give a choke point or a gatekeeper function to the city manager so i believe that a yes vote here um in at least my opinion um violates this charter so that's what i want to say thank you very much everybody knows where i stand oh can i say something yes of course so um thank you fred for all of your hard work since you've joined us um obviously i don't want to violate the charter so i'm still a little confused so fred does this what this uh what we're discussing does that go against our charter does it support it or is it kind of just ambiguous or you could read it either way and it would be fine either way i just want to know because obviously i don't want to do anything against the charter what what was just read is read i don't have it in front of me but it it uh i'm sure is verbatim what the charter says and uh mayor manzo has his interpretation of it and i i i'm sitting here listening to all the comments i i'll make another comment sometimes you'll make it exceptionally hard for me to do my job and there there are times it it's so uh complicated and so ethically complicated it's really difficult to do it and i don't know what the solution is other than me continuing to try and be forthcoming with all of y'all in in representing the collegial organization i again i'm going to stress that one rule that i include included and how important i think that rule is to the situations that i've had to deal with over the course of the last year and it's not unique to bel air beach i've dealt with the same type of issues in haines city so to answer your question robin is it uh in direct violation it's arguable in my opinion one one way that i can um fulfill the charter requirement is i can every single email that is between lynn and i i can copy all of y'all on um i have no problem with doing that i i want you to know what i'm doing but there's there's always a caveat to that that there are times there are sensitive things that come up that you know i i have advocated over and over again if there's something that's sensitive or highly sensitive and some things are then the appropriate thing to do is to talk to somebody directly and i i have always been an advocate for that because i think you owe it to the other person to give them an opportunity to address a sensitive topic and unfortunately this is one of the the complications that we have to work with i can't work around it i'd like to but i can't is the seven of you have to meet in public and you know i can have seven individual uh conversations with each of you yet i can't communicate as a conduit just like lynn reeves can't do that or anybody else and that it's a complication that we have to work with in florida because that's a florida law well to me it seems like this may and this is my interpretation maybe tying your hands just a little bit so i'm probably not going to vote for this and i would trust because i've never abused or actually i've never even used your services or talked to you about anything on the record or on the books so i have no problem either way because i'm not i'm going to abuse it and i would assume that everybody would also do the same thing and do it reasonably and if you're not sure you can contact lynn reeves and talk to him about it before you do make the next step to call fred so i'll probably say no to this just because i don't want to tie your hands fred and put you in any more of a difficult position than we sometimes do well i'll make a suggestion and that is you table this for another meeting and i will uh add some language that i think may be helpful and i simply continue on until next month the way that that we've you know the the current contract reads and um you know to try to do it that way that's a good idea glenn gund and mark beam we're almost there i mean the issue isn't on the direction side it's basically on the feedback side or response side is that correct fred well it needs to be a two-way street if one of y'all will need to contact me then you should be you should do that so there absolutely needs to be some parameters so that you don't have the exceeding your budget that that to me is what the real problem is is that the the way the contract was set up for the course of the last year resulted in more money being spent than you budgeted for that that is my understanding of the problem okay so i had no problem in delaying this decision to give you time to come up with some more comfortable terms but rather than following the existing wording i guess my request would be if possible to follow the intention of where we're trying to go with this thing in other words limit the conversation to city attorney city manager council does that make sense at all yeah it does until something happens later this week where uh that doesn't work anymore that that's the the point i'm getting to i mean again there there are things that you all are unaware of and you know it's because i have to keep competences okay so these are things that we are unaware of that i mean obviously are they have a private nature or do they involve the city so so i guess that the follow-on question to that is if if we leave the existing wording in effect until you come up with other wording then where are we in all of this you're using the current contract you have in place until you meet again a month from now and i would hope that wouldn't be create an untenable situation it shouldn't i have another comment to make go ahead okay i am a little bit confused uh city attorney riley because we're we're a small city we really should have small problems we don't have any commercial businesses so anything that goes on in this city should be uh made aware of to the entire city council i don't understand all this i'm sorry i just don't understand all this private confidential information because we're a small city we're a small little residential town that you know normally doesn't have any issues i mean we don't have any commercial businesses we don't have that issue at all i mean i know haynes city does and i totally understand that but anything that involves this city should be known by this city council as a whole and not each individual city council member calling you with certain things in regards to the city that aren't known by the other city council members so if we all take our concerns to city manager and then he contacts you that way it is known on the next city council member because council meeting because then you can reflect and inform the rest of them but if we go through the city manager then at least we have some point of contact rather than calling you and billing the taxpayers for all of those calls i mean ultimately it's coming out of their money and and i just don't see anything that's should be that important where it should be a private confidential conversation so i am totally confused about that aspect of it all together anyone else dave gaddis um i'm just seeing a uh i'm seeing um uh one of the citizens they've got their hand raised i don't know how long it's been that way but uh i'm not i just wanted to make sure we don't miss that person we haven't finished first round of the council comments we haven't went to the citizens yet so any other council comments before we go to the citizens marv beam like i said earlier we can call the city manager and we can say well it's a confidential matter all right the city of city manager knows we're calling the attorney if it's not a confidential matter the attorney can say it's not confidential don't worry about it he can either nix it there or then have the discussion with the city manager to go further that's i don't see anything else as that important that can't be handled in that way i don't know why we're beating this to death any other council comments madam clerk if the citizen any citizens that would like to be heard this is the time yes we have kim kim can you unmute yourself okay she's not unmuting so she like council member guys said she's had her hand up for a while she may have walked away for a moment if she comes back we can we can bring her in okay uh any other citizens patty before i come back to the council glenn gunn has his hand up no no others okay we're gonna we're gonna keep citizen comment open only for this individual who's had her hand up um so if she comes back patti just let us know we'll bring her in under even though we're in council comments just let just let us let me know and i'll get right to her uh back to glenn mayer there is someone just okay the hands up okay we have citizen comment you see it patty [Music] sorry this is kim shaw elliot we've had a technical difficulty obviously um what i wanted to suggest is that the contract that is proposed states that it will be in accordance with the ordinance and that the communications would be directed through the city manager i think this is an example of kind of a review of what the roles are of each of the entities here in that the city council serves as the policymaker they make the rules they make the ordinances um and come up with the budget whereas the city manager's job is to implement and to oversee the budget and to enter into arrangements that are within the bounds of that budget an anti-entity any entity works through others and has somebody accountable for controlling costs and monitoring costs so i think what has been proposed uh is not inconsistent with law in the sense that it states that it will be consistent with the ordinance um any time during a city council meeting the city attorney is there his input can be sought any board member can talk to that attorney but at the same time when we're talking about other matters and bringing in new issues it seems to me totally appropriate that the city manager would be accountable for managing the budget and for monitoring those expenses so i thank you for this opportunity thank you any other citizen comments i don't see patty anymore did she drop off hang on lynn reeves has stepped out so maybe he's gonna find where patty's at okay okay patty we have we have you back in lynn's spot um were there any other citizen comments no no others okay so then we'll close citizen comments and come back to council dave i'm sorry uh glenn gunn yeah i i think our last uh citizen comment was was spot on i mean the public forum anything can be said or directed i guess i'm having the problem that i'm having is along the same lines as rita swope i mean it's all public for everything we're supposed to do is in the in the sunshine everything's a public record so what is this concern about i've got private issues going on i i don't understand why the city manager shouldn't be the referee the traffic cop in this thing and had the professional courtesy because it is his job to obligate city funds to have knowledge of of what interactions are going on between the council members his staff and contractor employees that that's all i've got we've worn it out robin hockey and then mark b i would suggest that we i don't know if i need to make a motion to table it until fred can make a little bit more verbiage to give him a little bit more freedom because like i said i i have no problem talking to the city manager i just want to make sure we don't tie fred's hands or put him in a awkward situation or depending on someone's interpretation maybe violate the charter so i move to table this i don't know if that's okay to do now so the motion is to table do we have a second to the motion a second marv beam seconds it it's open for discussion starting with robin hockey i think i've already said what i've been saying any other council comments on that mark b lynn pays the bills anyway so why not go through him he's going to find out we went to the city attorney anyway it just makes everybody a little more honest i guess i don't know why but uh if we just simplify things and let fred change whatever he needs to change so we were not affected by the charter and hopefully that'll make everybody happy any other comments on the on for table fred i'll come to you after council finishes um their comments on the first go-round here so this is on the motion to table anybody else on council wish to be heard fred riley i i would that you table it i i would like to give you an example of the type of situation that i'm concerned about making a comment as an example is commonplace and it happens without there being any uh anything nefarious nothing illicit it is a garden variety issue that comes up is that there's a an issue on the agenda and there's a question in a council member's mind whether there is a uh voting conflict and if and so they what they should do when they any of the seven of you see that there's a potential for a voting conflict you should stop get legal advice and the legal advice is typically going to be fact intensive uh most of the the ethical issues are and that is a situation where a council member should be able to pick up the phone call me and we have a discussion that is not um in the open for everybody else to consider because that that is a typically a uh attorney-client discussion and that's that's a great example of what i'm talking about there's no illicit intent nothing nefarious it's to make sure that we we address that issue and there are times and i i've done this a long time now in my career where um y'all really don't want to discuss certain things in public related to a voting conflict um you know i mean some of it may involve your family some of it may involve your business and there are times that that's a best be a private discussion between the attorney and the city council member so that's my glowing example i again would ask that uh you continue it give me an opportunity to give you some revised language and i i want to make one more comment in january i uh had had an agenda item where i talked about the friction within the city government and the untenable situation that i saw and i urged you at that time to find a way to work better amongst each other and par part of the problem and i i will just say it because i'm going to say it bluntly is there is a lack of trust at times and it to me goes back to the friction and the untenable situation and um you know i i don't know how where the solution is but i still am optimistic there will be a solution to that problem but i again encourage you to give me or to to extend uh continue it so i can address language and come up with something that i think will solve the problem like that you've you've made clear concerns a number of you thank you mr riley is there any other council comments before i ask the citizens if they wish to speak regarding the table the motion to table this there are none um oh wait glenn gunn yeah with respect to mr riley's commas there is it unreasonable to to to uh suggest that you can't pick up the phone and say city manager i'm responding to a request from a council member i can't go into all the specifics that that's perfectly fine okay so okay so i so the issue isn't specifically used in the city manager as a focal point or a conduit for this stuff it's just a matter of the degree of information or specifics that you're willing to give them it it's fine for him somebody to do that but there may be a situation where somebody doesn't want to do that and if if they want to talk to me as the attorney for the collegial body then there needs to be that channel of communication and that goes to again the level of trust that i hope you would have dave gaddis so then my question is if the contract as it's written is so bad why did you go along with it and help lynn write it i didn't say it was so bad okay that the contract as you is written is consistent with what y'all discussed uh in a previous workshop okay and and you would not have written that contract in such a way as our legal counsel uh to where that contract was in direct conflict with our charter is that correct that's correct that's all i'm that's that's all i need to know right there thank you any other council comments patti gentry is there anyone who wishes to be heard on the motion to table only this is the motion to table um i have a hand up i'm um let's see it's leslie oh lynn oh leslie is she unmuted lynn leslie okay mayor she's not responding so okay i'll do the same thing we'll keep it open until we call the question and then if she if she gets back we'll just let me know and we'll get her back in thank you okay um back to any other council comments before we uh give robin aki the last word on motion to table i think we should just let fred write it how he would write it obviously lynn wrote it and i think there are some interpretation issues and none of us other than the mayor and fred are lawyers so we don't quite understand how to do this so i say let fred do it and fix it and we'll come back and approve it later okay so before the council right now is a motion to table the uh the authorization to execute the revised agreement a yes vote on here will table this um if if you vote no then we'll move forward with the vote on the um on the contract changes so with that madam clerk please call the roll council remember bean i'm sorry i did not hear that with that what that was hi hi thank you councilmember gavis no member shirley aye council member swope council member aki i vice mayor gunn hey mayor manzo aye so by my count it passes four to three the motion is the authorization to uh execute the agreement is tabled pending revision by fred reilly and uh and further discussion at the next council meeting we move on to item 14. um authorization authorized i'm sorry the city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services the description is approval of the memorandum of understanding with andrew tess cpa uh i believe this was brought by the city manager there's no council member's name here and the city manager is rejoining us first do i have a motion so moved greatest what makes the motion and a second bye bye okay we're going to read a smoke first i'll defer to city manager reeves mayor i'm sorry manager reeves yes this is a a renewal of the contract understanding we have with andrew tess uh if you remember he was appointed the city treasurer and in his contract he is uh in his previous contract there there's a clause that allows a three percent uh increase uh annually and that uh amount went from the current 1057 weekly to 1089 weekly i think he's done a great job for us and we continue to have uh uh a good working relationship with him for the city so that's that's all i have to say patty's got a problem with her uh earbuds there they so we're kind of switching back and forth so no problem i can see you both so when when you switch off i'll say um and i'll announce that just for anybody who's listening uh any um any council comments on this first round okay um we will uh well now i don't have anybody here um i'm looking for patty or lynn to see if there's any citizens that have any comments okay hold on there one second there there is one yeah okay you've been here now yeah they're charged again okay mayor okay yes leslie i i don't know this could be i wasn't in control of the board so let me see if leslie's still there one moment leslie man yes no okay oh there's no all right so no again i'll keep it open if i know we're having some technical difficulties if there's any counsel if there's any citizen comments we'll certainly get them in um but is there any uh there's no other comments then by citizens no other hands there is not okay then we'll come back to council so the question before the council is to authorize the city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services a copy of that detail appears as item number 14 in our agenda packet a yes vote will authorize the city manager to proceed madam clerk please call the roll council member gavis aye council member shirley pardon aye council member swope aye council member aki aye councilmember bean aye vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo hi so it passes seven to zero city manager you're authorized to execute the extension to the memorandum of understanding pursuant to what was in our packets and agenda packets at item number 14. thank you okay thank you um uh item number 15 is the consideration of nomination for appointment reappointment of the forward pinellas beach communities representative for a two-year term um this transmits the city's nomination to the big c um it was placed on by the city manager do we have a motion first still moved greatest what makes the motion second second mark beam is second we'll move to read a slope i'll defer to city manager reeves city manager yeah this is uh reappointing uh mayor cookie kennedy she's the she's serving the current term and she represents the beach community at forward pinellas and uh this uh was was actually brought from the big c uh organization so it's it's just confirming the vote that they're recommending uh well okay let me just add something to that it you actually have the option of appointing your own official so if anybody i i have no interest in doing this personally um if anybody else on here wants to be nominated that's an option if you put your name in then this council can consider it if not um cookie kennedy is the person i believe who's been doing it and um and she'll be reappointed or will make the vote to reappoint her and then it'll depend how the big c goes so um is there anyone on council any uh elected officials who have interest on this i have questions yes yeah questions are um cookie's been serving in this capacity for quite some time and has never brought us back any reports um how do we get information what they're doing i mean we certainly don't want forward pinellas bringing public transit to balor beach i don't think so lynn what's the deal with that i think i think this is this is a nomination from the big c so we either basically vote yey or nay rather we want cookie kennedy to be the representative uh as i understand it is that not correct mayor i don't think so i i think um they're they're today they wanted we have to determine whether we want to nominate her or put up someone of our own and now a question has just been raised on the floor um i will um if i might i mean i do attend those and i know more of beam has attended the big seas regularly some other people have too occasionally but um there is occasional report on here um jody shirley is absolutely right forward pinellas's agenda is to bring mass transit to the beach communities and um whether you like it or not that's their agenda i mean they they they want to push mass transit so um it's it's may not be something that our community is desirous of i might feeling from speaking to most of the people that i know of in the community that's not something we wanted to do so um you know the big c is going to vote on this because the big c gets one representative um but you know the points should be uh considered absolutely i've never seen a report come back here personally there may be some stuff at the big c we get some updates um but you know in terms of letting all the cities know regularly i'm not really seeing too much i don't think martha we've had uh forward penelos at a city council meeting probably about a year ago a year and a half ago lynn do you remember yeah they they came about uh uh west bay they came in right trying that was before the 2019 council was seated right he didn't like what they said i mean they were planned included widening west bay all the way to gulf boulevard and having um you know a trail and we weren't you know i myself wasn't very pleased with what they talked about doing which was narrowing the road and you know putting medians in and um making big wide you know bike trails and things like that so you know i don't know how we get a say in it is all i'm saying is i think it's something you know i think in the past it was presented to us and we're just like oh cookie's gonna handle it let's just go ahead and let her handle it but i don't know that i understand you know um the whole the whole pecking order here and i guess that's why i'm raising the questions uh council member shirley i'm i'm reading it here and it says each big c municipality excluding clearwater shall take formal action to either nominate one of its own elected officials or support the nomination of elected officials from another community or the real appointment of the current representative so basically we can someone on our council anyone any elected official can serve on this if they so desire if we nominate them and then our that that still goes to the vote of the big c we can nominate someone else in a different city um or we can uh uh sign on with a um renewal for cookie kennedy so um there's you know there's three options really that are before us i guess first i had asked a question if there's anyone interested on our council in serving on this because certainly um you know we would probably want to give them due consideration is there anyone on our i'm sorry can i ask lynn do you think it would make i mean i i have never attended a big c meeting so i may be speaking completely out of turn here so i'm just but lynn do you think that uh if one of us volunteered for that that would be that we would be able to even have much say in what well the well what would happen is okay there would be another nomination cookies evidently been nominated at some point uh so then it would be a vote of the mayors at the big c or you know if if the mayors aren't there the secondary representative then they would vote and in the end who whoever got the most votes would be the person that would be promoted to there oh so there'll still be one representative yes correct big c will vote on it each mayor getting a vote each elected representative i think it's always almost always mayors but there may be in some cases well it is an example if mayor manzo couldn't go to the big c or something and i think marv's the secondary that's correct he would he would be the one that would vote beller beach will get one vote along with all the other cities except for apparently clear water so um so yeah if someone's interested i mean absolutely they're gonna get you know due consideration here and i and i do believe you will have the opportunity to speak to the big c and and why you would be the right person to do it to try and speak to the other mayor so it's um you know that's typically a video meeting now and it's a relatively short thing it's about an hour hour and a half um usually in the beginning of the month i guess i'll ask it again before we move on to what our alternative so step one first priority anyone on our council wish to be considered for this sure i will thank you i don't think we need seconds or anything like that um it's um we have a well i don't know yeah i i think you should probably you know take a vote on it so i think we should yeah but i don't know that we need a second we normally don't do that with nominations for stuff so um jody shirley has expressed interest on this does anyone else have any nominations for any other anyone else on council does anyone have any nominations for anyone in any other municipalities jody shirley is before this council at this point expressing interest in being our nomination for forward pinellas um i am going to uh well comments does anybody have any comments on it jody i'm going to totally support you on this um i i think that the issues of forward pinellas don't jive with with what we're doing here in our city we are our unique city i think you know it exact over here and i'm going to support that and i'm going to speak for you when we get to that um with that meeting as long as i'm there and i would hope mark beam would do it also so if i'm not there totally support you anyone else okay so okay i got a thumbs up from dave so we're gonna uh do a uh a roll call vote on this and um the the nominee this would be for bellar beach to nominate jody shirley councilwoman jody shirley to be the representative our representative um that we're putting up for consideration for forward pinellas a yes vote is to authorize jody to proceed on that all right jody's nomination to proceed madam clerk councilmember shirley yes councilmember swope yes councilmember aki yes councilmember bean hey councilmember gaddis hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo hi so it's seven to zero um councilwoman shirley you are uh you are going to be our nominee um i'm gonna ask the city manager if you would contact or maybe the city clerk if you could contact um the big c and let them know that this was our decision and i would like just ask the courtesy that jodi b um i think they normally uh everybody gets a copy of the agenda but i want to make sure she knows in advance when the next meeting is so that she will be able to be heard and she should be on that agenda and if and if she can't put herself on the agenda then ask it is my request that she'd be placed on the agenda to speak to the mayors yeah i would imagine that we'll send a patio send a just a memo that to uh mayor serrano as the big c president and then they'll they'll uh put that on the agenda at their next meeting you would imagine it and but i've had trouble getting myself on that agenda sometimes just due to the way things communicate well okay she's taking a big step here to put herself out to do this and i want to make sure she gets due consideration with the big c members right thank you okay so we now move to the unfinished business um and captain liner is still here okay so we have utilization of a pinellas county sheriff's off-duty deputy for a two-week trial period at no cost to the city um we would have to outline the specific duties and outline a method to measure effectiveness and added value this is unfinished business so we don't need a motion on here um this for anyone who might not um who might be listening who's not familiar sheriff galtieri uh offered this to us on his um when he came appeared before us um to basically see what it would be like to have an extra deputy and maybe to hit some of those hot spot things we've been talking about so with that i'll turn it over to the council i have a question for you um it states that you're going to do a two-week trial period and outline specific duties as well as to measure the effectiveness what two-week trial period are you gonna look at because it would be very difficult to compare a two-week trial period of this year with last year because of obviously the huge decrease in tourism and everything else that's gone on so what two week period are you guys going to do it and compare it to as far as another two weeks without it i think well we're discussing that yeah just just to give you a little update i had uh i asked captain liner to put out the boxes on gulf boulevard again correct and we did that uh the 85th percentile uh speeds and these are average they they ended up uh the highest 85th percentile was 38 miles an hour uh of the four boxes there was a 35 there was a 36 and another a 37. so and these were put at 6th street and going north and southbound and at morgan street going north and southbound uh sixth street uh one of the weeks was 18 to 24 august the other three boxes were from september 1st to september 8th and uh and speaking to captain leiner i asked him for some better clarification of okay uh as an example if if we had someone above uh 41 miles an hour which the our 35 mile an hour zone there's a five minute or five mile leeway uh so if we looked at the times above 41 or 46 and we found out that there there were certain times as an example uh the higher speeds happened on the northbound between uh on weekdays between weekdays and weekends between 4 and 7 pm at 6th street on the southbound they happened between 2 and 6 p.m on weekdays and weekends then we went to uh morgan park or the morgan drive one uh the weekdays were three to six the weekends the the higher speeds were between 7 and 10 in the morning on the northbound and on the weekends it was between or on the southbound it was between week 4 and 7 pm on both weekends and weekdays so captain liner can speak more to this but uh this is the information we found uh we overall the percentage of of uh [Music] percent above the limit was in most cases uh let's see less than uh five percent in most cases it was 2.4 percent 1.3 uh 1.6 and there was one area that was 6.1 percent so captain liner if you want to discuss it further yeah i did some additional analysis obviously i'm here um yeah when you talk so just so the council understands the majority of the well state law does not allow us to enforce speed between five hours five miles to six and ten miles an hour over so they exclude that right off the bat so excuse me from zero to five excuse me so from zero to five so anything out there from 36 to 40 we can't enforce it's not in state law they take that right off the top um so then what you look at then is things start coming in at six miles an hour over so at 41 up state law allows us to enforce the speed overwhelmingly when you when you're talking six miles an hour over um it's six to ten is your overwhelming amount of violation so anybody out there doing 41 to 45 is your main category of what we can enforce when you hit 46 miles which is 11 over the post limit all of the studies indicate that less than one percent of all vehicles out there are going those speeds so but you have to also understand too like let's say northbound golf in morgan you had 37 000 cars 37 186 that we recorded from september 1st and 6th so when you're looking at uh one percent you're talking you know less than one percent you're talking 90 vehicles so i don't want to get a loss in all these numbers and stuff but i can tell you this one thing is if we go out there we can start slowing down the people that are doing 6 to ten over those are going to be most of your violated while we're out there doing that we can also obviously address the people the few that come popping up that are doing 10 and in one case i think somebody was doing 30 which is insane um so we capture that while we're out there what these boxes don't tell us um are the concerns you have with people passing in the media it'll give us average speeds and 85th percent thousand stuff but if we're not out there we're not seeing it we can't do anything with these idiots that want to pass but somebody slows down to turn east onto 12th or something so what my thing is i said the sheriff obviously offered the opportunity last time um he came to the meeting in august and offered it again and he said look you know you've got two weeks where we can go out there and actually put hands on um we'll use our traffic unit that are well trained in all this um to provide that and then really get a look um how how it is out there and then we can come back and tell you um what i did identify with those boxes were those times that lynn talked about i'm like hey if if we had a specific time when when's the best chance of catching people um or when they're violating the most excuse me and that's where those times came from so that means obvious up to the council whatever you want to do the sheriff's office still stands um and if you want to move forward with it i'll work with lynn on time and any other concerns you have and it's kind of where we're at i have glenn gunn and then i'm going to speak after glenn go ahead glenn gunn okay as some some uh thoughts and not necessarily in any particular order if you bring out a specialized traffic unit to look at some of this stuff does does that equate or transfer over to bringing on an additional off-duty officer in other words will he have the same skills and have the same equipment to uh spot some of these offenders okay and and related to that is i agree with you it's it's not necessarily speeding i think some of the residents issues with the traffic concerns and biller beach come down to just like you say passing in the meeting i think that is probably one of the most egregious things we see in here is some knucklehead just pulling out around traffic and uh bypassing everybody you've got people blowing through the pedestrian crossing warning lights and that's a pretty egregious one there and then lastly you have an issue where you get backing up and traffic congestion at causeway and in the so those are issues there so a related question is is we've been offered two weeks and to me probably one of the most effective ways of gauging the effectiveness of this thing is if those two weeks straddle or include the three-day halloween or the three-day holiday weekend coming up in october that would be a great time to uh to exercise that because you're going to have peak traffic along gulf boulevard during during that weekend so i would like to see a trial during that period or at least encompass that the the duty officer himself we're asking how do we measure the effectiveness of this thing how do we know if it's really adding value to us or worth the additional cost and that's a pretty hard one to see what i would expect to see i guess and the only thing i can kind of uh point my finger at is i would expect to see some bump in the in this the traffic stats so if if you've got an additional officer on there for two weeks for for that reporting month i would expect to see more citations more stops uh help me out here would i expect to see an increase in in those stats you have i mean you got two two possible outcomes uh we're using specially trained traffic people from our traffic unit that are used to seeing this and doing this and they live and breathe this stuff if there's an issue out there then you're going to see an increase if we use those specialized components and there's not an increase then it might be the fact that it's not as big a problem yeah okay so that tells us there's there is no problem and we may not need that after all and and we we have this uh misperception that there's a problem out there that there really isn't but and they're the only they're the only ones that are going to be able to and i i appreciate you mentioning the crosswalks that slipped my mind they're the only ones that not the only the one the boxes i'm going to do that are going to do the passing um and that are going to do the um pedestrian crosswalk that i can't get from me i put a deputy out there that's doing all these other stuff but these people whenever these deputies out there long golf boulevard and they're concentrating on only traffic they'll be able to hit your pedestrian crosswalks and be able to do the median passing and this yeah now i know precisely what marv is going to bring up here and i agree with it i think 100 percent here i'm going to come back to you after i speak and then you you're after me okay i was when glenn is finished so okay well then i i'm going to bring it up one more time and now i'll steal more what i think is mars thunder is the use of unmarked cars the the the thing of bringing in suvs with a a side decal blaze and then a bright gold star gets a lot of attention on gold boulevard and you can pick it out like a sore thumb so my question is is why not bring this guy in in an unmarked car and let's see what's really out there i'm gonna agree with i'm gonna agree with glenn gunn on that one i've seen the sheriff have has an unmarked car right now that's in use um that should be utilized uh i live right by gulf boulevard i could see it from my window and um some of my observations uh we say a two-week trial period but you know if you're out there monday morning you're not going to be finding much but if you're out there sunday and if you're out there on saturday and i agree with glenn gunn also a holiday weekend that's when it starts that's when the fun starts um passing in the center lane is is routine failing to yield to pedestrians and crosswalk is routine drag racing has become somewhat of a routine um i call it the stunt show with some of these uh trained motorcyclists who come through doing wheelies and uh stuff standing up on their seats and stuff like that i'm not a biker but i don't think that's legal um that pretty much tells me it's not um i do agree that you know the majority of people follow the law you can see it just by looking out the window you can tell they're doing within the speed limit but it's not the majority that we're after the majority of people follow the law in the world um it's not i i venture to say if you looked at all the people who commit crime captain you probably have a small handful of them five percent maybe that are the troublemakers and the rest of us all follow the law same deal here most of the people do follow the traffic laws but that five percent can be horrible i mean like you said we have people that are going 20 30 miles over the speed limit this is a residential area with people walking across to go to the beach children you know it's a disaster waiting to happen here so um i would suggest that maybe if we instead of having a two-week solid period perhaps we consider maybe breaking this up to several weekends and a holiday weekend at that to get a good representation because i just don't think you're going to get it on wednesday morning the other thing i would say is is maybe the final workout goes between yourself captain and our city manager i think he's hearing what we have to say here tonight but i don't want to lay out the game plan for everybody and say you know columbus day we're going to be out on gulf boulevard because that's as bad as bringing the marked vehicles with the big star on the side everybody's going to know it you know and then you're going to say oh everybody's you know doing it and then a week later at the veterans day it's going to be horrible okay so i don't want to see that if we could avoid it so that's my points and i'm going to go to morphe captain yeah like like glenn said if you brought a ford taurus out here that would probably be better than an unmarked squad car if someone is going to speed believe me the speeders know every car that you guys have i mean they just know it hands down so the minute they see a car that's similar to a sheriff's car bingo they're they're they got the brakes on the other thing i like to say is not that i'm getting older not that i'm that old but pulling out on gulf boulevard i know your latitude can go up to 40 45. you know you'll you'll bend a little bit but when you're trying to pull out and you see this traffic coming down and you're looking back and forth on gulf boulevard then you have to pull into the center lane because you got traffic north and south and somebody's doing 45 you better get out there in a hurry or they're going to hit the tail end of your car and that's the problem we have on the weekends when they're when they're hitting 40 45 to judge to come out in the traffic for someone that's older is a challenge so i know i've said this on the side street dropped the speed to 20 but if they drop the speed to 30 then most people would do 35. just just conversation that's all i know nobody wants to hear it been through this exercise before but it works and i'll come back to you after i get everybody else on the first go around anybody else on council comments first go around and captain liner maybe if you'll just respond to everybody at the end it might go quicker than we have in a one-on-one with everybody one-on-one maybe just you can respond to everything at once does anybody else have any other issues before i come back for a second go around here with glenn gunn glenn yeah before just just two more things uh back streets everybody's got waze and everybody's got some sort of app on their smartphone telling them what the uh the workarounds are so you know you got people cutting down bayshore or whatever so so that's that's one hot button area and i talked about traffic congestion backing up at the lights at causeway there one informal observation i had immediately after they opened up the beach on uh after the coven stuff was we had guys out there manually controlling the lights and my my informal observation was boy things traffic was really moving through those lights so i'm wondering if there we can't identify some peak hours when traffic's coming across the bridge or going home in the afternoon or late evening and just for an hour or so have an officer out there manipulating those those lights so that that's just something i noticed it seemed like traffic was moving a lot faster during some of those peak congestion hours when they were out there manipulating the lights that's all i had thanks how are we going to leave this are we going to um i mean i think we're i don't know what i don't know that we have a start date for this again i don't want to disclose necessarily but are we ready to move forward with this do we trying to get this out for october there's an idea of doing it for the columbus day holiday is that what our goal is and if so then how do we want to leave fit for action items for me or the council anyone what's the best way of approaching it ours our side of this is if if you all want to move forward with it then i would think i'd work with lynn and we get it all going and then we've got to get obviously some type of measurement in place so we just don't spend our wheels out there and we get we get you an answer to what you're looking for um so i don't want to go out there and say hey we'll measure this and i come back you know we don't want to measure that so i work with lynn on that as long as you all want to move forward with it i think that sounds good i think uh get with len get you know a list of those items that have been talked about maybe len you can circulate just to final get a final okay from all the council members that everyone's on board and just get it set up yeah we can do that we'll get we'll get some type of schedule set up and uh based on the information that we've got so far we'll we'll pick some times and uh see how that works out and then you would all have have the data so when you come back and say hey you're looking to move forward with the secondary employment or you know the cost side of it right and then we have the data we all make a decision on that i mean he said the sheriff obviously stuff that we had to say and we wanted to do it so realistically no cost so we put some you put some resources out there and see what we come up with captain i'm gonna say my thanks again on behalf of myself and the city for the sheriff's generous offer in doing this um it's something we've been talking about i think everybody on this council is dedicated to having a safe city and a better city in terms of you know quality of life and i think some of this is quality of life stuff um so um thank you know our thanks to sheriff galtieri and please we're gonna welcome all the feedback that you could possibly give us because i i my suspicion is this is going to work it's you're going to find um you know these these some of these individuals that are abusing our our rules and laws and um i think it's something that this council is going to want to think about down the road in terms of you know maybe supplementing the police uh patrols that we have particularly on some of the key weekends that we know are going to be problems for us so thanks again oh anytime i'm sorry glenn has a comment after you're finished captain go ahead no i just had one one question more and more you drive around our neighboring municipalities you drive down east bay west bay you see a lot of unmarked cars a lot of the neighboring municipalities are using unmarked cars you see pickup trucks no light bar on it you know no count catcher uh bumper on it and boy you know typically you can look in your rear view mirror and pick out that big white suv with the light bar on it and the big cow catcher thing and i know who that is my question is is does the sheriff's office employ unmarked cars within the same realm as some of these other municipalities a great car with tinted windows and no light bar and i mean we got a lot of equipment okay he's not going to tell us the detail and also not giving out too much there's nothing pollute us from other concerns that were brought forward and studies related to those so we're doing more than just one approach here there's more prompts this so all i can tell you is that we'll look at it from every which way we can to get you the best information the best data so you can make it inform this week thanks captain we'll invite you back also when this is concluded to give us some information on this if you're available thank you thanks for again for the attention to this okay i believe that takes care of unfinished business and we'll move on to item 17 city attorney if he has any comments yes sir thank you uh then city manager number 18. uh yes uh i gave you your code enforcement report in your packet uh i want to ask depending on what the governor does where the council stands on meeting in person in october or not meeting but it's really going to depend on the governor and at this point the virtual meeting expires uh october 1st so uh just some feedback for that uh the validation hearing for the stormwater fee is going to be the 25th we are of september we're going to do that virtually and i'll be putting a notice out uh when i get with uh chris rowe so we can hold that here if someone wants to come and uh speak at the validation before the judge let's see in person oh mayor i'll have some checks to sign on friday if you can give me a time and the last thing is uh we had a lien that was out there for several years and between laura and patty we got it collected it was only about eight hundred dollars but they made a concerted effort to get that when the property sold uh so i you know kudos to them for making sure we got that that money and it got paid and that's all i have then with respect to the virtual meetings as i recall the resolution that we passed i believe we said we were going to utilize the virtual meetings as long as the governor kept it in place i could be wrong on my understanding i think that's what it read um and if that's the case then as long as the governor renews it unless we have another you know motion and something official that's that's where we stood i believe on that resolution so i might be wrong if somebody has a different understanding please bring it up well i i just wanted to bring up that right now the the uh governor's thing says october 1st he he did extend it to that point when's our council meeting for october uh october 6th i think so you'll have plenty of time to see if he extends yeah okay yeah yeah it's uh so i think you know from that standpoint and hopefully we'll have some applications for the code review committee so we can look at those and go forward with them robin aki has a question yes update on that email sent by the resident about the code violation on 17th street has that been i went by and looked at it i mean it didn't seem like hang on a second i i based on fred reilly's last memo since that was sent on a legal letterhead and threatening litigation and i'll defer to your expertise mr riley but i don't know that we can discuss that that seemed to me to be a threat of litigation so you tell me i don't want to overread the letter it wasn't a formal notice of litigation but yet it did say um if you don't capitulate i'm going to be suing you or i'm going to be getting damages and stuff so before the city manager answers that i just want to make sure we're within the parameters of our um ordinance here i'm not familiar with the letter um i don't know send it to me or not but it doesn't ring a bell with me if if there the letter referenced anything that was could you know basically is uh that we're about to go to litigation that i would would not recommend that you discuss he threatened it and he wrote it on a lawyer's letterhead i mean i i i have no problem if you tell me it's okay i don't mind if the city manager speaks on it but he's disputing the validity of our law and the code i'll defer my question until later until fred can look at it i didn't think it was intense i just thought that that was his letterhead because it was his firm oh no yeah it was his firm and it's a code violation and uh i've got i will tell you this i i have the city engineer looking at it because it does block drainage and no permit was obtained to even put it in place so uh there's a couple issues there and and it would go to the magistrate okay again i'm gonna because i didn't get an answer from the city attorney why don't we do this um mr reeves you know you certainly know what this one's about and you know what robin hockey's question is you can discuss it with mr riley and then get back to us as you know either unfinished business or if necessary as a separate memo you can do that also again whatever is acceptable i don't want to commit something that we shouldn't commit to writing so yeah proper way okay that's fine i think i saw jody shirley's hand if i'm not mistaken is that correct yeah but i'll just wait to hear back from lynn because i had another comment about that but okay any other questions for the city manager did we answer all your questions mr reeves yes okay city clerk is she there um i i know she's there is she hearing us okay okay i just wanted to say um i really appreciate that council's going to give me a consensus on how you'd like the minutes done so that's good i really appreciate that and then also that action minutes are what's always recommended i mean you have to have the proper documentation on point of order the rulings and what led to it and when somebody requests to have something put on the record so but i would really like to hear how you all would like the minutes to be done so looking forward to that thanks thank you any question questions for the city clerk okay we have city council comments it's an odd month so we could start with read a slope and work our way alphabetically backward i don't have anything further to say thank you um uh jody shirley um yeah just a couple of things that you know thank you captain liner for all your time this evening is you know well appreciated thank you again for that um real quickly uh just i talked to lynn about this and i know we haven't discussed it again but it seems as though that um the marina discussion has been assigned to the parks and rec board and hopefully we'll hear back from them regarding that uh works us work session and how we address those uh issues on the rates there um i think i had a question about the walking path this would be towards it for lynn the walking paths are we any closer to getting bids on having those paved or yeah we got the uh preliminary number if we did them all it was about 160 000 and what i suggested is as we do the projects for the stormwater that we just time in that it would be less costly to us at one time so uh we'll have some more discussion on that at a work session to get some consensus on which way we want to go with that and then what we could do is just add added into the storm water or not i don't want to say it's coming from the stormwater fee it would be added in as is part of the stormwater project but it would be paid for with general funds it would be when the paving is done on those streets okay good and then just kind of a final just when i was kind of reading all these minutes and it got a little confusing there's some you know back and forth you know let's put this hat on and take that hat off and i'm gonna i'm gonna make comments about um i'd like to make citizens comments i want to you know i want to be counsel now i think that and i don't know just just bringing it up so there's not that confusion if we want to discuss things that are not on the agenda or you want to make a statement about things that are not on the agenda but as a citizen not as a council member would it be appropriate to say those things in citizens comments to say i'd like to during citizen's comments say my piece as a citizen about whatever topic i want to talk about and that's i'm i don't know if i'm looking for a reply but maybe some direction with that for future meetings and that's it okay thank you uh dave gaddis i have no comment at this time marv beam no i'm just um listening to jody and walking paths that's about the only thing that i had in my mind so i'm looking forward for something going on there now again jody covered what i was going to say about the marina so waiting to hear about that otherwise no comment vice mayor now i've got a question about uh 2-63 d that was raised by city attorney and his memo and my question is is that standard boilerplate in most municipal ordinances but the reason why i asked that is because i mean here we've got a an ordinance issue and all of a sudden because we're making inferences we can't even discuss it or ask what the status is or why so my question is is is that prohibition to discuss those sorts of prospective legal actions standard boilerplate was that peculiar to biller beach um i would say it's probably peculiar to bel air beach interesting so okay so and it's an ordinance i mean that's that's not a charter review kind of thing that's something that could be changed well it's a city code provision so you you can change it if you choose to okay thank you yes sir um i guess to that end i'm going to echo that i i read that and i i wasn't as familiar with that either i guess as everyone um and i thought it only had to do with uh litigation that was actually pending but this is actually a situation we've had several letters um in recent times with threatened litigation and it seems to tie the hands of our council i think it's a very bad very bad ordinance okay the whole purpose of that of of a letter and why the florida statute gives a six-month time is so that the city can react to it and see if they can head off litigation if they feel that that's in their best interest we can't even discuss it that is a terrible rule the problem that we have now unfortunately is that there are letters out there there there's notices out there i'm not going to discuss the details but it does implicate certain people on this council and we may and i and i i started this earlier when i was in the car mr riley we're gonna have to be looking to you to guide us and shepherd us through as to what the conflict rules are there were some proposals tonight that i know are out of left field there's no one on this council as far as i know be accused be it relations be it friends it doesn't matter you don't the way i read these rules no one has to be resigning anything and you will confirm that with us please in the future but you may have to recuse yourself from certain votes so i think to glenn gunn's point i think this is an ordinance i would like to see changed like immediately the problem is there is many of us on this council um who might have a conflict now so you know we may be changing it with a small group of individuals but change it nonetheless i think we need to push ahead if we can legally change this because i think that we want to have a discussion on any future litigation that may ever come up in front of the city this is not a good idea okay it's not a good idea to discuss regular litigation in the open but something like this that's exactly why the state gives us the six months so i just throw my two cents in on that for consideration i think it is something to jody shirley's point just to echo it i know we're not supposed to back and forth um i would have no problem with a council member you know speaking as a citizen we are all citizens of this city if that makes it easier um i i believe if i'm not mistaken i'm not sure if she was referring to me or not i had to um because of the unique situation with what's happening in bellair short i could only speak as a citizen so that's why i had to exercise that i don't think it'll come up on too many issues in the future other than that i think we are running out of time on the census i don't think we did very great but i think we did better than a lot of other cities so if you know anyone who hasn't completed the census um time to do it because i think we're running it out and last but not least last year we did a proclamation on september 11th we did have that proclamation um i just want to make sure that everybody keeps in their minds and make sure our city keeps in its mind the uh the horrible tragedy that occurred on september 11th on in both the pentagon shanksville pennsylvania and the world trade center and all the people that fought to get those uh freedoms back for us so um i'll never forget it i lived uh 20 miles away from there and um i just want to make sure nobody else does either in our city so um we're totally behind all the first responders and all the military people that went and made things safe for us so um that proclamation is out there and nothing i don't think has changed in this last year other than unfortunately we've had to have more actions as a country to police this stuff in the world there's bad people that would take our freedom from us so um we're we're totally behind them glenn gunn yeah to uh address uh jody shirley's thing about this hat thing speaking as a citizen it goes back to this 2.63 and it's paragraph c and there are some protocols for making citizens comments so i i think something that needs to be looked at is if it is an allowable sort of thing there needs to be some compliance with the protocols on this thing in other words citizens comments are made during the citizens comments portion of the public forum and there's protocols for they're only made from the podium and you give your name and you give your address so and it only applies to items not on the agenda so i'm saying i agree with with everything that i've heard here but there's more to it than just yes i think we can do it everybody should be allowed to exercise their first amendment rights well i think we need to take a step back and look at okay well what other aspects of this do we need to comply with and that's fine we can we can if we wish we can debate it at a council session i don't think it'll in a work session i don't think it'll come up a lot what you just did speaking after me actually isn't in our rules it's city council comments it's not time for a debate i'm not picking on it i'm just saying there's a lot of things that we do tonight there was some very effective questioning of captain leiner and lynn reeves just to get information and even fred riley but technically if we really want to enforce our rules there's not supposed to be any questioning at all supposed to go through the chairman i mean it would be cumbersome if we did that so um i never you know i mean on certain rules uh we're we're bound because it's under ordinance or charter other things we can be more flexible on i certainly will do what the group feels like i'm not i have i'm not led to any of these rules if it's in an ordinance if it's in the charter we don't have the latitude unless we change either of them um but you know i i i had i take no offense that you asked a question after i spoke here and and i think that that's healthy so i you know unless it gets crazy out of hand i don't think it ever needs to be stopped and i think it's healthy so um anyway that was the conclusion of my comments if anyone else says anything else i'm gonna ask for an adjournment then we have a motion to adjourn and uh all in favor aye all right our next meeting win is um the twenty first 21st right okay so we'll see everybody on the 21st at 5.05 all right interesting time we'll see you then good night stay safe everybody"
