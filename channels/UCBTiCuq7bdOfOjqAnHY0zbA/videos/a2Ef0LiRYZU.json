    "transcript": "okay hi everyone i'd like to call to order the wednesday july 14th um park and rec regular board meeting city of eller beach sure tammy lavender i'm here norah kodak here george ortel nicole sussman here and then kyle riefler okay okay great and then can i have a motion to approve the agenda for today a second all in favor okay um item number two so we need to approve the minutes from the last meeting june 16th i make a second all in favor okay it passes everybody's approving last month's meetings okay number three citizen comments we don't have any citizens item number four okay so this is where i really appreciate that you guys were all there on monday because then you know what was asking us and so like i said on monday i had already um put um at least for the jazz and the part in a spreadsheet like all the items so say it's entertainment invites postage beverages security decor and linens name tags first aid station signage posters and banners garbage recycle city staff cost insurance koozies layout diagram parking plan yeah so i had already given him all of that like a month before that so had i known that they were going to do that we could have already had it in their paws and they could have voted but we didn't know so you know whatever we'll do next month we still have time um so with that being said um we're still kind of like between kyle and i hashing out like the here is kind of what the um the postcard the final one will look and i only made like one copy but they're just going to be plain white real short and sweet on recycled paper so i'm actually going to physically take that to sir speedy and because i'm thinking maybe the price they gave us for six hundred dollars when vistaprint's 120 they could think it's like 20 colors and lots more going on and diagrams and pictures and a lot busier when they see how simple it is i'm hoping that they cut the 600 way back and then the postage is going to be the postage from everybody it'll be the same price so i'm going to see if i can get that price knocked down because they're saying vistaprint is only saying when they plug 33786 in to their database they said we only have 615 registered postage addresses which can't be true i mean kyle's like no we send it to way more people so something's funky there we just can't that's why we might go to sir speedy because they have the list with you know they send out the hurricane notices they send everything official business from the city so they should have a better list for our postcards so but we'll see what they say so we're trying to get like as opposed to twelve hundred dollars we're trying to get it cut down to like under a thousand under 900 something like that so we're still working on the price for that and so on the spreadsheet that will still kind of like be a little we could all we can do is put a ballpark because we we can't order them until it gets approved so they're going to understand that okay so for vistaprint it was 400. exactly so if we have he said three or four months but that's kind of right on the line of what the thing is so i have a feeling it won't be done oh no yeah so we'll just do those little signs like we talked about which is good to know sorry no that's great and then yeah leonardo said the little signs are it won't be done okay we can do the little signs yes so like that'll be on there and that i mean it'll kind of be a question mark so what i have is i have a column for estimated cost which is all i can do at this point until it's approved we can't like get you know to we can get as close as we can and then we'll get actual costs we'll be close so i did find out that from kyle today i'm going to call the jazz band and have them email their liability insurance to the city and then nicole if you could have the italian icebender just kind of you can wait until after they vote if you want they'll um go give it to me because like they had to go to their insurance to put the specifics because it has to say city of bellar beach and the address so once i get it back they're going to email it to me i'll email it straight to patty so she or laura sorry laura so she has it and she asked yesterday like when it was and i was like oh no until september she's like wow it's far in advance like well that's how we work so we'll have it yeah perfect all good okay so um and then like the amazon order i've already looked it up so for three tablecloths and then just a little bit of tchotchkes for the music and stuff like that that he's gonna order on amazon we could definitely keep it under a hundred dollars 150 so there won't be a lot of money spent there so one officer will be 150 name tags i mean you know i don't know like does patty have the ability to make us little name tags like she does with these i figured those would be pretty easy for the last event somehow how's that i think laura made it um and then first aid kit we have a first aid kit in house where we have to buy one um we have a first aid kit okay how long my name is i didn't have that to everybody but no but i've done it it's kind of events before you know that's true and we can do it at the table where we're giving away the water bottle and the koozie and then they can just just ask people if they don't find anything they can write their own name and just pop it on themselves yes we'll need to add those hello my name is to that do we have that's good food neighbors i think ours will be different than what she's talking about is that what you mean so they know we work here yeah yeah ours will be different than the hello my name is for sure yeah yours i have like a city seal yeah city seal that's a good idea board member or whatever yeah no that's a good idea it's a good point i have four i can just let you all borrow them although i don't know if you're gonna anyone that i have i have a really black tight tank top they look nice on you but they don't look good they dry really fast huh they dry really fast oh are they they're quick drying yeah that's good um so the signage we should be able to get like the um two banners and like those little yardstick ins that we talked about for about a hundred bucks so um we'll take care of ordering that once this gets approved so garbage recycle i know that you have the cans as far as like having someone here on saturday like obviously so the building's open and the bathrooms are open that's going to be a cost of city staff yes i don't know how to yeah then we'll work it out okay so do i should i take that off of there yeah i would take it off take it off yeah do we have a plan for last time i can't hear you you had a sign to take the garbage i haven't yeah um we'll we'll find out what we're going to do for staff and then we'll work it out kind of like right before see last last time we had um did him just take all the cans and put him in the dumpster enclosure area you know what i mean at the end of the night yeah yeah i figured that i think i put set up and clean up at the end like we would do that one of us would do that um well i think i think what they meant by that is like before when they were talking about street parking and getting like emergency vehicles in and out of the parking lot because there's no street parking and it would be no different of a plan than if the parking lot was full of beach people every given saturday it would be the same plan and we would have like a sheriff here and um so like i don't know if you want to speak to that it would just be as long as you're not letting vehicles start parking everywhere yeah there's no double parking there's no valet park you're only gonna park in spots yeah so you're not parking if you see someone not then you just can notify the deputy to tell them yeah there's no need for anyone to park not the spot yes if they gotta just pull up and unload stuff that's fine and then they pull back out yeah exactly so i don't think we need that only because it would be like if it was like i said any given saturday you call 9-1-1 the sheriff is already here we are we have a first aid i thought they met like in case of a hurricane well if it rains we're all coming in the building so we already talked about that like a rain and then like i just don't know if they were in the past see i don't know that's but like i just assumed too because people would be coming in and out of here to go to the bathroom we would put the band more on that end because there's more room to sit out there and then people can come to the bathroom in these doors so they're not like walking like you know like say if the band was like yeah what we did we did they didn't have to walk around oh they did last time yeah okay it's not too bad i don't think it's just to kind of keep this area secure so we would only because i can lock these doors so they only when the band's here they can get in and out but they're kind of here so no one's coming in here yes okay whatever so we would only open up the building if it rained and we moved the whole thing inside yeah if it was pouring rain then i would i mean you guys could help me come up under it everyone would be here so you can kind of see what's going on will they open up this room well this room will be open from this side because the band is going to need access to the electorate but they'll kind of be like the keepers of this room in a way you know to make sure just random people are coming in here right okay so you do have to go around to either side to go to the bathroom right so we need signs for that um we could use them make it easier so that yeah so that people don't have to rely on yeah because i didn't even know that i would assume that like they could just i thought this was gonna walk through here and you could cut across and then because we're only doing like two tables if it does rain it's gonna be super easy for us to just move those two tables right in here and then we can put the garbage and recycle outside in the hallway um and then just move everybody into this room um you know maybe if they're down here we can just set them up in this corner or whatever and then we'd have everybody out here and then we could maybe remove the tables like back up against the wall so they don't feel that kind of the only thing i'm thinking is like the way i don't know how many chords are running because i think last time the reason the main reason was probably because they had fords running from these outlets you know to to get because you only got one circuit out there so they're running a lot of different amplifiers or i don't know what they do but yeah you know i i can ask them so if they don't really have much you know i would just probably beforehand i'd probably just lock certain things up and then it'd probably be okay okay what should i ask because i think last time we were just under they we were thinking they're gonna have lots of things running you know what i mean and they didn't want their equipment people near their stuff too i think yeah so i don't know i guess that if the band was comfortable with it and i just kind of made sure things were locked up you know that could be the best way or something what's how do i phrase the question like how much um power do you need how much how do i say that i guess ask how many plugs they need and how many different circuits circuits yeah because they're like 20-inch circuits but they may you know depending on the draw ask for a certain amount so because they don't want to pop cut out on them right okay so that's a good question does do you think that'll i mean does that come i think it's doable you know doable as far as like if we flip it yeah well if we just have it open this way as long as they're comfortable with it because you know it's a traffic in and out like what the band where they're at well like i said the only time i've seen them play one time was like they were playing right in the middle of an hour yeah yeah and i've been there there was tables this close to them so they're used to people being it's not like they're you know like i'm up on the big stage don't touch me yeah i think it's like they're down here and it's kind of projecting out this way and people walk up right there and walk into those doors and go to the bathroom that won't bother them yeah because they can kind of keep all their stuff back here and if they have cords that go there like people walking in those doors won't go anywhere near them okay so that's up to you guys i mean i just assumed because we could use the room if it was raining that we would pretty much have the room prepped just in case okay and then it would be open all right then i'll just double check on that okay what's your question how are we going to let people know or they're going to say what are we going to do like you know obviously we'll be watching the weather and like when people get here if they if you know we're handing them a bottle of water so if it starts raining we're going to move it inside you know we can just give them a verbal maybe you know like with your spreadsheet just write a quick thing like blurb on that that the emergency plan you know any any regular emergency the plans to call 9-1-1 um and use the normal streets for emergency vehicles because everyone would be parking in spots and then say something about if a like an unexpected lightning storm rolls up that the plan is to move indoors okay until it passes streets will be open for emergency vehicles and then officer on site you're going to do you're going to have an officer you're paying for for the event and then you're going to have the regular duty police patrol in the city but if people are parked illegally they're going to they're going to take care of it yeah because that's our duty okay we're gonna have a hydration station did you say we're having a first place well that's what's it like just we're gonna have like the hydration station and then like it'll there's a little sign if we don't have one here it's like six bucks it says first aid so it's like if someone needs a band-aid or a simple thing to make a convenient reaction no so like that'll be a 9-1-1 thing yeah like falls and scrapes his knee and he only needs some neosporin and a band-aid we'll have that sure so that's all that we're not yet we're not going to have another section that's that's the same way we treat it if somebody fell in here yeah we're going to clean it out and give you a band-aid well we're going to call 9-1-1 and we're going to call 9-1-1 exactly so garbage and recycle insurance that's taken care of so and then the koozies we kyle put that order together they look super cute so that would be good okay so lay up layout diagram so along with the emergency plan i guess like i came here when i was just walking and i literally took a million pictures about here like to try to get in my brain like spatially at least a million especially like where things would go and how it would work like so people are coming up from like this side or like cutting through the back and like obviously the the band's gonna be up here but where do we put the two other tables like um you know like just out in the parking lot so i when i if they're if they want that kind of detail i wasn't planning on just something last the last one we had all these vendors and booths so like we marked them and numbered them but if we just take an error an aerial and you just take a marker and mark stuff on there i can make it can you email me at ariel yeah because i mean that's all you're gonna need yeah it's gonna be super i mean we have one vendor two tables in the band i mean we literally will have four things on there it's not complicated but just like i'm thinking i not only do i want it to not be complicated i want it to be visually correct like easy access like i want people to like as they're walking around like they see things and they know hey this is you know i know where things are even though there's only a couple so that's where were you thinking of putting putting what tables they said well okay so that's what i didn't know like so i thought if the bands at this end i was thinking of maybe even putting a table like back in that corner like like right past that door and that's where we would put all the stuff like the wearables um with the in there like so the bench would be behind the table and then we could put stuff on the benches and bring it up because i thought you know if we're going to deal with money and all that stuff we don't need to be at a table out in the parking lot or out you know so in that little turn around we would put the italian ice vendor and then maybe one table up here and then um oh the vendor comes out he's not a truck it's a truck it's a trailer trailer so a hole just unhitched to wherever he wants to go oh well i don't know about that okay yeah it's not like it's not super small it's probably like a seven by sixteen oh okay so that's why i thought he would just be in the roundabout because people can't park there anywhere this market and then we just really the only thing we need to figure out is where the hydration station slashed first aid and i thought that like i don't know i'm kind of thinking more people are going to come in that way just because of the parking lot as opposed even though this way is prettier there's still pass the band that way i think everyone's going to go that way come in this way so like just somewhere um you know where when you first walk out between that little building and the sidewalk you would see like basically like the welcome where you would get your name tagged we should take up those chairs yeah i mean if we say it's a pig you know bring your basket in chairs yeah you have that on there bring your chair yes bring your chairs and your blankets at least we don't have far to go with the merchandise and then if it does happen to storm at least it's covered well it's not really covered but at least it's closer to the door to get in here and then i'll um i'll put up the chair the chairs it's live like so that doesn't become an issue people are trying to pull together sometimes people start you know what i mean yeah so there won't be a chance you're pulling them out there that they all do it yeah yeah so if people like if say we do get rained out and we have to come in people are still gonna have to use their chairs or just kind of stand around and mingle we're not putting these chairs out we're not setting up like a banquet room like a wedding it's just gonna be like hey you can come in and stand like a cocktail party yeah you should just stand around and talk if you didn't bring your chair like you don't expect anybody to sit on the floor but even if like it's not like that's covered so they can sit on those benches if it rains you know that you still haven't pergolaized yeah yeah you're going to get wet so yeah i just thought those benches would it's kind of like a nice little pushback cubby where you have the table and then you have like storage back there and like no one can come up from behind you and you only have to man like one side if that makes sense yeah it's the cash box too and and the cash back almost everyone will walk by and go to the bathroom so even if they like you know are out there and they just go out there and they park and they don't come up here and they don't see it and everyone will try to go to that door yeah yeah it's just my thought but elaine you'll have to have to be someone here that you'll just secure the city staff you can secure the cash yeah so whoever is here i would just hand over right we would have a bank for change right and then yeah whatever sold is sold and then just we'd hand whatever didn't sell and the money we would just hand over to whoever's going to lock up the building and then um maybe think about how you want to account for what you're selling if you can't really just count what's in the drawer to give out change i mean inventory or money i mean i would just kind of but probably gonna want to know that you're you have in your inventory and you're checking off what you sold so that everything lines up with the individual yeah so we would just have a spreadsheet with how many that we have yes we sold one we put a tablet mark so tally it and then you can just yeah just to account for the money because we don't have that much stuff so it would be a very short list of so i'm assuming we're going to do one more t-shirt order before the because we have very little left to sell and we have people coming in all the time that can't find anything they either like or fits them out that we do have i would like to get try and get rid of what we got left over yeah well hopefully we do it that day um because even like the one lady from bellar living said i can guarantee that 90 of the people that live here don't know that these things are up here to buy so it's like hopefully more people will see them between her article which will be published before then and they'll see like i gave her some pictures i'm sorry i don't think i told you so um jules chandler from bella living came here and interviewed lynn just about the city i'm not exactly sure what they talked about and somehow she was talking to patty and the jazz in the park came up and like she had already bought a tank top and i think maybe they talked about the towels and she bought a couple towels and she's like oh well i want to interview tammy i want to write an article about what parks and rec is doing because this is great i think more people knew about it then then they would come up here and buy stuff or whatever so i was like well you can come to my house if you don't mind my big slabbery bulldog jumping all over you and like knocking you over she's like oh no no i'm good and stanley was like so so embarrassed but anyway so she um she just asked me a bunch of questions like you know she was big on the blood drive and the beach cleanup and you know she's like i she took a couple pictures from the painting on the beach the beach yoga so um i told her you know the event thing you know i don't it's not really you know we're still kind of like liquid on that so we'll know more later so i don't know if she was going to really like write about events but she was definitely going to write about the merchandise and stuff like that yeah so it's like and i she pops up on my facebook stanley's facebook every once in a while stanley's facebook my dog has a facebook page and i'll see her i was like i don't know who this lady is but she's friends with deb keith so she pops up um there's a picture of her having like 10 ladies in her backyard and one of them has on one of the tank tops from here but she's like i bet you 90 of people who live here don't know so sh that'll help because she took a picture of the towels one of the koozies and um a couple shirts so hopefully once people more people know about it they'll fly but like if we place one more small order at least we'll have stuff to sell right but if we do yeah we gotta make sure we keep sticking to the kind of like one thing yeah yeah i mean one color one one color one design because i'm like if you get like a buzz like a bunch of people yeah yeah they they can't really be like picking yeah if you have laura and patty you're gonna go nuts or even us at the table yeah no we'll we'll keep it to one and that's fine yeah that's i mean no it just makes it a lot easier because you know people don't know right away what they want what size because size is all varying colors and it's just a lot for everything else that they're doing to no that makes all the sense in the world you know keep it simple and then the other thing is like you know we're still looking into the um the vanity plate or the license plate that says bellar beach on it that i mean you guys used to sell them here do we not know who you got them from we used to have them on oldsmar too i just gotta i'll look okay see what i can find have you like googled it oh yeah yeah there's a couple of i mean a couple of places that make the signs make them a couple of the t-shirt companies make them i have you know but you can you kind of have to design them if you if we wanted to keep the same design that was here in the past or if we want to decide a new one i'm i don't care in a way i just like if you just put in um there might be one lying around stuff or just vanity plate yeah and i had one i bought one down in sand key but i've contacted those people five times and it isn't even the mean people it's like people in the nicer stores like north of there and they just don't call me back so i just assume i mean they were six bucks they so they had to pay like two dollars for those you know that and i can't get them to call me or place an order for me so that's why i started looking like other places okay oh no so that's they just give you examples of what you can do no that's not the old one had like literally i think it was you know on the website it's got the beach umbrella on the beach it's that that's what i thought i was like we might not want to do that right now with the next super cheap oh i get it i just like what what's so bad about it i'm on the beach yes whatever exactly don't talk about it right now yeah so okay perfect so an ariel would be good and we're still gonna we'll place one more kyle we'll place one more t-shirt order and kyle will um you have a lot of stuff to do one more order here vanity plates and then um we should be good because we're not doing any food and we're not doing any beverages besides water that whole thing with this is going to be super easy there's just not going to be a lot to do so because we have to decide this now or put it on now so for the halloween thing i don't care what we do on here i put water apple cider and halloween donuts you know how you get the donuts with halloween colored sprinkles but we don't perfect is that easy it's supposed to be kids and dogs i mean i didn't want to get too complicated with refreshments for that day is that okay with everyone because we could probably get all of that if say we have 100 people we could do that for 150 bucks quick math um and then the three orange vests the parade numbers and the tree bags with candy i priced all those things out on amazon we should be able to get that for about 125 bucks that's easy the prizes for with amazon gift cards that'll be like 450 and then security i'm assuming we're gonna have to have security for that too because we have security for the last one not for the halloween it's pretty quick it's two hours what are you gonna do for the two hours well it might be at 14 minutes no so like okay so we've got to get everybody here and we've got to get them set up we've got to get the numbers on get them registered get the numbers on them then you know like so say that takes a half an hour because you know people are going to walk in late and all that and then like i said i walk the little parade route it took me 12 minutes going pretty slow so just say 20 minutes because the dogs and kids are going wherever and we're trying to crawl them back into line so um we get them around we get them back and then they line up in front of the judges so then the judges we have to do the little like score sheet i'm sure you had one of those last time i i've never done it but i'm sure there's examples of it all over online so then they have to like you know stand in for the judges and the judge's votes on whoever and then we announce the winners they get their prizes we pass out all the treat bags to the doggy treat bags and the kid treat bags and then you know we do the donuts and apple cider okay i guess so that's why you make it like an hour and a half all right yeah as long as it's kind of like that feel to it no officer well no are you selling things well this is the only suggestion that some we weren't um we can but the only suggestion that someone made was i guess there's this little 11 year old girl she lives in bel air and she does homemade organic dog treats and she's like oh she would love to set up a little booth and sell these and i don't even know if we want to go there i kind of don't but i it's not up to me to make that decision so i thought i'd ask you guys what you thought i would rather have no we're all going to be in orange vest directing things like i don't really want to sell things because she would have to kind of be like registered as a vendor for the event if so i'm thinking yeah it would be it would it wouldn't just be simple yeah so let's start because if you do one you got to do two you have to kind of like you couldn't just let only her yeah or there'd have to be some kind of like okay i'm fine i'm just handing out treat bags everyone's gonna get a treat bag anyway so she doesn't really need to sell her dog treats she handed out our cards i guess yeah she's a resident like with the amazon gift cards yeah and you know honestly how did she find out because oh because she was in bellar living it was jules chandler who suggested it she's like oh she's so cute she's a little girl and her mom and dad would be with her and help her and i'm like i'm thinking she doesn't live here once yeah herself here why don't we buy from her i thought about that but like they're homemade as long as we're not paying like 100 for homemade organic dog treats and giving the kids snickers bars every day i should have taken stanley for a walk before i left what exactly are you walking with kids so what we talked about is um if you are in the main parking lot sure and we would just kind of um the way i kind of envisioned it is we're outside and um that little section like you know there's like three or four spots that say 15 minutes okay we would kind of rope off that little square of a section and set up the tables with the judges right there along that sidewalk and then so we would line everybody up you would walk west on the cot you know right on the causeway you would go south on gulf boulevard walk to 9th street take a left right back into this parking lot and right back around in front of the judges so that's what i walked it was 12 to 15 minutes with like a normal pace which it won't go that fast with the dogs and the kids because you know it's going to be slower no one's going to be like whatever so i would say 15 or 20 minutes and you never cross the street yeah and you know we keep everybody in a single file line um yeah it's on the sidewalk so yeah and i i mean i got best for you to wear oh you already have three vests yeah we have best in-house so are they smelly no i so is everybody okay with that parade route and then if you talk to anybody because then like so it'll just be the three of us we'll need at least one or two more volunteers so yeah if it's simple like that i don't think that's a vet that you're gonna need a police officer you're a police officer for that event specifically i mean okay no that's great i wasn't sure see if there's a reason we didn't have one at the last one you didn't have it at the last one no okay perfect do you know that you're not serving alcohol and you're not selling not dealing with cash i don't see if they're staying on the sidewalk and they're not crossing the street yeah we just have to make sure because you know like how this i mean our last one was kind of like in the it was back here in the road parking area thing you know and then they had yet people gave it out no we had we had our own candy was there other people giving out candy too was it like a trunk or treat i think it was it was a trunk or treat yeah trunk or tree trunk or tree yeah so i mean you guys are gonna have goodie bags see that's another thing too so you don't even you don't have to have anybody else giving out anything you guys are doing it all we're just going to give everybody here even if they don't want to be you know if it's a kid or a dog they don't want to be in the parade they can still get a bag so are we submitting this that's what they asked for i think it's better in good school yeah why slow rule it always looks like we're doing something that was just you know i think we're prepared i mean we don't have to give them every detail we just have to give them like the big picture outline budget um general like they don't need to know how we're passing out the candy i'm thinking like we can make that i mean right or no yeah they don't yeah you're having goodie bags that's funny it's something yeah it has like treat bags on here with the cost so we'll have time to figure it out and then afterwards anything you don't give away you're gonna return the city different budget plans so this is all on just one spreadsheet that they'll that they have where it just says the the tie the name of the event the day and time all the expenditures that i'm going to have well i have it all on one now but it seems to be clear yeah well i mean it's like um pretty much the way it works is the jazz takes up one whole piece of paper and then you flip it over because the other two are so small then it's the halloween then it's the christmas so i mean it could very easily be printed out on three pieces of paper i was just trying to save the tree no that's a good thing like we're not killing trees here we're saving the trees it's i mean whatever you guys want to do like it's very easy to break it into three pieces the way i make it like wrote it up or whatever if they want it on three pieces of paper i understand what you're saying let's break it up into three yeah put it on three different pieces of paper i would do because they all have so the way that lynn did this though he put him all three on one here pass that down the church he put it on one piece of paper and then pretty much this spreadsheet follows that outline exactly yeah he's just trying not to overcomplicate it and then and then i have the budget so the budget will be attached i mean as long as there's a way to decipher yeah it's just in that order i can break it down sheets it's not a deal um and literally on here i do have layout for the parade 12 to 15 minutes in duration from lot from city hall parking lot west towards gulf boulevard south on gulf boulevard east on 9th street back into city hall parking lot okay so like i wrote that down for the plan and then um we can do another ariel if you can just drop me three well actually yeah for me just drop me three aerials and i can do one for each event do you want the one they have it here yeah we'll have the same so what i wrote like on here i wrote it um oh here i wrote all else same as above um for all three events meaning like we have 70 parking places like safety protocol emergency vehicle protocol um first aid technology yeah that's what i'm saying that is in there it is in there yeah i typed it on there yeah like it will be like you know the section of like that those items that would fall into that bucket it will literally say these things apply for all three events so it's not the same thing isn't retyped because then it'll be six pages long yeah and then there's they gotta read through each one and see if it's different yeah it's it's better it's just that makes it lazy it's the same information and which is also good like we're doing at the same time which is a little bit more pain now because like i didn't think we had to think about christmas now but we do but whatever well we don't have to get super detailed we can just say we're doing like a cookie budget or whatever it is that's still going to be like before a council meeting what the christmas lighting no they wanted to vote on all of this next no i mean um the actual event itself oh yeah yeah so it's like before a meeting so it's kind of like everything's in the same as for a public meeting building will be open so yeah yeah so it's monday december 6th this regular city council meeting it'll start at five o'clock so it'll go from five to six right before the normal meeting it's a holiday social and tree lighting so i literally put holiday refreshments 200 so whatever we if it's cookies or punch whatever we end up doing and then look we always have an officer here but they'll have to be here an hour earlier right that's up to you i i wouldn't say so for the for a gathering with the tree okay no okay um because i mean they're gonna be here for the meeting anyway and then so i did send kyle like a little thing because i thought okay we're going to light the tree the tree is very smooth and not very amazing it's very small the tree's hot the tree's going to small the i think it's like i wanna say 16 feet all right small 16 feet yeah for an outside tree all right i thought it was nice it's like 10 feet tall it's not that it's weird it is nice okay whatever we're gonna do we're gonna do this but i thought what would be cute so like i googled like um like christmas choirs and i found one for 250 bucks or something like that there's like three or four of them that will do christmas music for the hour carol yes carolers do you want to do it no okay i have a voice but i did it they go around and you can to your house and um just run around with your friends and i belong yes so i think it's a good idea not us but can we hire people to do that yeah well that's right so like i have to get back to them in six days they do have a cancellation policy um i can you know wait and see if they're you know like i think after august what okay so she really likes the christmas caroling character idea idea is a game changer just took this little tree and i was trying to think who cares about the train now just got someone bigger there's something else to look at how fun is that i love it okay so and then that is like two holiday music is all i put it under and that was like 267 dollars so um so our grand total budget is probably going to be give or take around 3 500. so i mean that's for everything for everything all three events for all of it does anybody have anything else like or something generic that we can put in they're not generic but like a bucket to put in there like if this needs to be are we gonna have a little wiggle room or no wiggle room like this it's gotta be like dead on to the paper no it's gonna be wiggle room it's not as long as you're not tacking on like doubling the budget oh gosh no no but i just mean if it's like 225 dollars as opposed to 200 or yeah yeah i think that's reasonable okay like i am you know i actually put it in there and some things might say less this could be uh these are all estimates it is in there so i estimated cost and actual cause some of these things we're still getting pricing a little bit like 10 you know and that will give us automatically for whatever percentage of 15 of them okay yeah okay perfect is there anything anybody else wants to add or do that to you what do we do gonna find so no santa i'm okay i mean they're usually it's i like the carolers i think that's really sweet i'd rather put that money towards um i don't think we can have alcohol everyone can have i mean can we have wine at the holiday thing or no i i'm just asking whether you drink or don't drink i mean is it is it an option because that's a huge part of the budget if like the city's giving outline i just didn't think like i just don't know you can sell or give out alcohol beverages but there's you have to get a permit and you have to have the officer for that it's more complicated you gotta get your permit i don't know for that event that you'd want to do right before city hall meeting yeah it just doesn't sound like a great idea the hot chocolate in the marshmallows that's a great idea the spice cider spice cider spice cider hot chocolate yeah so we're going to keep it friendly and yeah non-alcohol infused if that's okay because it is a lot easier and the budget would go up a ton if we try to give like wine away and i don't know yeah then you got id you got an id i don't want to sell you you got to id everybody it's not even like they're obviously like 60 years old it's like you have two cookies yeah cookies carolers um i'll do the merchandise that's it yeah i'm signing up for all right so yeah something's warm all that or do you guys have warmer interesting like hot um you know like giant like pots we don't have that type of thing not we just never had it those coolers but what are we serving just see like you know if we do hot chocolate with marshmallows and hot cider so um i mean it could be 80 degrees or 40 degrees like you just don't know how are you gonna do the hot chocolate are you gonna are you gonna prep it at i would think we would prep it in the kitchen and then be with those things with the spigots i mean so you would um that was you have to microwave the water to get it hot because you don't have a stove that's just like little things it might might make sense to have all to get all those big coffee makers plugged in and eating and then you can take it out it stays hot you know i don't know and then you can reuse it that's probably something um so is that like something we need to put in the budget like hot beverage dispensers because obviously then you guys let's see what they can hear forever boss let me look up what they cost and um so they maybe wouldn't go in this budget because i mean like we're not putting like the coolers in the budget the city's just no we're borrowing um but that was something do you have yeti's but that was something if you needed it more coolers the city is offered no we we're gonna just use the coolers that we have in our garage we can use clothes all right we have two big like one huge one and then one medium and i think the hot hops have a medium one i just have like an egg blue one that's fine okay it does i mean whatever whatever it doesn't matter yeah we have coolers that we're just going to bring out of our garages can we allocate money for ice yes okay worth perfect yeah water it says water ice yetis in hand um but i did not think about the hot beverage dispenser so i'm glad you said hot chocolate hot cider whatever doesn't someone in bellar beach have one of those like kerosene things whatever they are like those metal hot things so you plug it in someone in this neighborhood has to have one i'm sure gotten under there if you could find them yeah it'd be a matter of finding yeah you know you could even rent them yeah you can write like taping dishes you can rent those so this is something that lynn requested last year and it didn't happen because of covid he just wanted a little holiday social gathering um where everybody just gets around it's kind of like a cocktail party with no cocktail so we'll have like you know refreshments and then the official lighting of the christmas tree for the holiday season the tree is always on the front so this would be like unless it's freezing it would be a parking lot thing if it's um cold we'd like the tree real fast and then do it probably in the lobby i'm thinking it's weather dependent then because we don't know how cold it's gonna be everyone's gonna be in here anyway because of the meeting it shouldn't be so cold that people can't bring a jacket yeah yeah so i was just thinking out front yeah everything's kind of running for like a 10 meter one about 50 on the low end and 75 on the headlight for just those like portable ones my i'm sure searching further we can find things i mean they go up until 100 so we would set up tables in that same area that we would do the um the costume parade like in that little square so that the tree would be out of the parking lot yeah he wants it outside okay no it wouldn't be in the parking lot it'll be up front up front so but like where i'm talking about setting up is right on the sidewalks we would put the um right there um we're setting up the tables for the judges exactly the truth judges oh i thought we were talking about our house but i said we would set the tables up in the same exact place um because where's the halloween judges going um okay so like if you have those 15-minute parking places right in the front yeah so we're going to kind of square off that area um we're going to put the judges right on the sidewalk and then as the parade comes around you know they would walk in front of them right there because there'd be no cars there it'd be like blocked off the same tables and the same tablecloths that we're buying for the jazz fest we're going to reuse for all three of these events so that's why we're getting white so for the christmas evening yeah yeah exactly whatever refreshments we christmas cookies hot chocolate yeah we need drinkware for sure hot drinkware just foam cups yep so and if we're only doing cookies we'll probably just do foam cups and napkins we don't have to have plates or forks or anything like that whatever kind of cups paper hot paper cups um should be kind of set up in the lobby we can do either do it well you just said you wanted to be outside so both for the the lighting and everything i don't know i mean the weather should be good too to be out on tables too outside outside yeah and we can have the carolers standing right by the tree and keep uh keep that little bring a coat and you have big trash cans out there so that all the trash can go right there yeah hopefully no one spills hot chocolate where where exactly is the tree right in front of city hall or yeah it's right out like if you walk out the door it's like right there down those stairs it's right right in the middle as if we're close to the outside sidewalk okay there's like a wide area that's where it is the white tree thing like this is the christmas tree the white like lights it's white lights yes yeah it's classic small tree the classic songs with the star so spatially like we can literally not right now but we can walk out there and say here they're here are the trees here are the christmas carolers here where we're going to put the two tables with the cookies and the drinks and then that's pretty much that and that's really it's real simple it's one hour five to six not even because the meeting starts at six so it'll be like 45 minutes of a little holiday it'll be small it'll be small it'll be small i mean i'm just saying it's not going to be a yeah it won't be big to do yeah who knows maybe the whole town will show up and then i'll come to the meeting and we don't have enough no i appreciate that cups popped into my brain and then they popped right back up right afterwards your peppermint shops and your exactly when are your time i got a question about the halloween so you got the judges in the in the customer parking area where's the general gathering area for like the people showing up well so it will be right so if you're coming around like and you're pulling in and you're parking out in the outer areas so it's like that whole area like between the 15-minute parking and then you have the hole that you have another set of parking in front of the sidewalk all that'll be blocked off from the general gathering of the people should we move it back here so that we don't block off any parking yeah it's kind of um because you need for halloween you might get kids and dogs you might get you can get close to what you get for the fall for the year we can absolutely move everything right back here i like it it's a sweeter spot you're sitting at the water yeah i mean yeah that's a so we would just okay so because the thing they walk up and they so then they would walk right up here and start and end here instead of the parking lot yeah it's great then you have to worry about being in the parking lot okay yeah perfect we should throw up that little girl's homemade treat i don't like that well we're gonna have it says call and register so like say if we get 20 dogs that register we'll make 30 bags and then we'll have extra stuff see i don't know that's why i'm like i you know i'm not willing to spend ten times more on the dog bags than i am the kid bags so that's my only thing like i don't have pricing or anything um well maybe that can be interesting yeah there's a couple like i was thinking we would do the organic ones for natures that are only like five dollars a bag and then you break those into little treat bags and we can make like they would be like 50 cents a bag and then there's some newmans make some like that are turkey and sweet potato that are made with organic barley and they're like four dollars a bag and they come in little hearts and you know you just they're cute i don't know i wasn't really planning on spending 12 to 15 bags for like homemade because this is the other thing homemade are good if you eat them right away after five days they grow mold and i have a freezer full of organic dog treats that i made and stanley loves them like but you have to eat them like right then or they because there's nothing in them they they go bad real fast so because we don't know what she's putting in them and that's why i'm kind of like you know i mean i don't know what they look like how they package if they fall apart if you i mean so i mean i could do a little bit more research but like you know if if we can do it and stay in the treat bag budget i'm all about supporting her but if like it's through the roof that probably no that's great i don't care honestly i don't care i want all the feedback i can get i don't care where we set up like i think that's great i didn't even think about putting back there yeah i think it's nicer yeah perfect um really have a nice view oh absolutely we're gonna switch again huh we're gonna switch i yeah it just this time oh cause you're next time yeah you didn't even get a good view today i saw that story coming coming soon yeah it was great the left it was clear to the right okay so is there anything else that you because okay so lynn moved it now this isn't due tomorrow morning he's going to move it back to august 2nd so we have a little bit more time yeah did they did they see the towels yes hey everybody did you guys see the towels i did not tell me actually i didn't see the towel all right picture i think i said nicely i think you're saying you want to go get one yeah it's just cute i think i sent a soft towel without the embroidery and then i saw the towel embroidered but didn't feel it that's right i met the blood drive lady she's very nice her name is linda so what's going to happen september for city hall meeting because monday is the labor day which is full to the 13th where it's falling to the 7th how does that normally work september yeah well for september it'll either go to the 7th or the 13th so this last month time they did it it would have been the seventh and then the other versions so historically it would go to the center i think so is that it is that right tuesday the following day and you know what my friend came on my boat with her husband and she actually had that logo on a gray hat and it looked so cute i've only seen it on the tan hats but great i think the grays always sell yeah yeah she just bought one it's so cute yeah she just bought it yeah yeah because we used we did have tan but you know we got it right now yeah crazy it looks nicer on gray i think it pops on there it does pop up okay so um nice i love it i just don't like white it like freaks me out gets dirty so quickly this is we would make a killing off golf towels just saying okay anyway that's for 2023 22. it's a new life well by the time it gets approved and yeah it'll be 2000. okay so okay so that's the event and they'll vote on all of this on august 2nd and um can someone make an emotion to approve this list to be presented to the council to vote on at the next meeting nora first george seconded all in favor aye so it passes so um i will just everything that we talked about today i will type up and put on a more clear format so there it's not confusing and get that to lin probably since he doesn't need it tomorrow morning now i'll get it to him next week so but as far as the christmas carolers you let me know if i should just let that go or book it okay excited and then okay so beach cleanup the first saturday of each month from eight to nine the first time we had four people the second time we had six people i've already had a couple more people email me or verbally say i'm gonna be at the next one so if we can just grow it by two or three people every time oh and i actually had a lady call me today i couldn't understand she's like i'm from so and so and i saw your beach clean up and we would love to help so i'm gonna call her back i don't know you know what it is but you know we're just going to hope that that just grows organic i think that's definitely yeah you know yeah and no pressure so it is what it is okay and then well last time since there were six of us four of us went north and two people went south yeah because we we literally um we go as far as we can in a half an hour and then we turn around we go back so like i in my head the bigger plan would be say if we had 20 people show up then i would literally say you go to sixth street you go to 12th street you like and i send them in twos or fours and then everybody meets back at 19th street for donuts and water after so it's not really about to eventually turn into everyone kind of enters in from where they live and they just kind of walk that and end at the donuts unless they're right there then they'll just you know pass it anyway and go as far as they can exactly i'm just going to kind of clean up um you know what i want to say we got some more almost to martin park yeah but like last saturday we got or the this one saturday i mean literally it did this to us we got hammered with rain and then so we turned around early and then it stopped raining so then we could just kept walking do you get soaked oh yeah and then i went to yoga at 9 30 and the sun came out was beautiful and then it started raining again and then they're like by the time we get like our yoga mats and towels and all that stuff put away it'll be done again so we just kept doing yoga oh it was totally fine and the sun did come back out then it did this again so i was drenched like three different times but that's fine i don't know i think we should maybe this time plan because i mean i have heard a lot about people coming i will put the post out there and then we can judge if we need two boxes of donuts because i know like but i think since it was like it was set in front of everyone and like the meaning like presented i feel like more people are going to show up i mean i'll still do the same thing with the facebook group but i think we should kind of plan accordingly on that one you know for sure yeah how are you doing that water are people taking it okay okay let me know i could do at least one i mean if only like four or six people show up this time or even eight like everyone's only taking one bottle yeah like you gave me a case of 24 i think or 32. so yeah we said water okay so yeah those um are just you know just keep doing it see how it goes north not counting 19th 19th right at the edge of bella beach so that would be the first one's about 20 a little past 21st first yeah and then the next one is um i believe 25th and then it goes to howard and then it's near the marina those those block must pass walking paths i looked at my um yeah this is you can't park there but if you're local you can start there yeah yeah there's bike racks there [Music] oh i see what you're saying just the beach pass [Music] um yeah i mean you know everybody has to meet me at 19th street i give out garbage bags gloves and then i just we kind of say this is the way we're going so like if um you know what i mean like we don't need six people walking down the same stretch of beach because it's just there's you know it's not very big it's not that much so i would just say you know what go down to sixth street or go to 12th street or go to 19th street or go to morgan park well if you and even if those where the sea oats are in front of those accesses that a lot accumulates just right yes there is yes that's a good place to get attention exactly so as it gets bigger and bigger we will have the list i will have the list in hand and i'll just dip people out and like say you know if they live there or not if they want to come back for donuts and water they got to come back to 19th street but i have to give everybody garbage bags and gloves well no i okay say like i would say go to sixth street you get in your car you drive down to sixth street you park you get out with your garbage bags and your gloves you go like half an hour and you turn around and come back and go back to 19th street for donuts so it will be a little bit of driving like if someone doesn't want to drive or like say if they walked across the street because they lived near 19th street i would just leave them at 19th street i would get my car and drive down to a different lot just so we're picking up like bigger areas of the beach as it's small we can just stay right where we are but if it gets bigger we can definitely divvy up and say just go drive to this one or this one and come back well third if they're out of town they can't park there or yeah out of the city right but you know if anybody that's from out of town who wants to come and pick up our garbage i'll get more right no right right i'm just saying they can don't get a ticket we can't no no i understand that yeah i mean the marina [Music] yeah help us pick up garbage and we charged them you know we charged them yeah i know it's not but there's not really a way around that no i understand i don't think anyone's gonna be beaten down the door to come out with some watertown i don't think so either but i think people would i don't know so like this lady i don't know where she's from like it was an organization so i will explain to her you know these lots are except for morgan park where you have to pay to park in the marina which you have to pay to park unless you have a bell or a beach sticker you have to pay to park if it's something like they're serious about you can look into some kind of temporary past thing like if it's a big group if they're really serious and like they're not just whatever yeah that you know then you don't want to turn them away but i guess you can engage that okay so when i um talk to her tomorrow or the next day i'll just i'll say let me talk to you know the city staff and i'll go back to you and then you guys can say because i'm not familiar with the organization but it sounded like she was from like some kind of group um okay like some charity group or something that like love the idea of like you know the beach that the beach is getting cleaned so reach over it's like better go get more donuts yeah what i would do is like i would ask her for a number because you know we have to plan accordingly i don't want nine boxes of donuts left and people aren't showing up i don't even want two donuts left someone always gets stuck with them and someone gets stopped this time this month someone's next but i mean like i said i heard until and the other option too is like even if i had to take some of the supplies instead at another beach access like i could do that like and then if you know you guys can make it then but we'll figure it out we always figure it out so i'm not worried about it i think it'll be good but yeah maybe 20 people will show up this time i don't know but i'll post and we'll see what do you do with your trash put it in the big cans that are out there okay because i'm just wondering how much how much do you end up with um okay so the bags that you gave me are ginormous so what i did was i just took a roll of normal 13 gallon bags and i give for every two person people we have one bag okay and then so and then everybody gets a set of gloves and then we share so we end like say if there's four of us we end up with two bags of garbage um and they're pretty full i mean we're finding tons of stuff to pick up right um and even like when we walk down this way we'll pick up a bunch of stuff and then we turn around we walk that same stretch beach again we find more stuff that we didn't see the first time like even if it's like we're picking up cigarette butts and like straight shoes that's the stuff that's hard to get glass bottles plastic but we buddy up so it's like easier because like you're walking together you take turns with the bag so it does help and then we just gather for the donuts and then everyone leaves i give everybody a hand sanitizer and then we eat the donuts and then i say let's go to yogurt that's good you sanitize your hands we do santa okay so that's been the play and it's been fine but let me know if you ever end up in a situation where you're just accumulating too much traffic launches no that's just what we've been talking about and i didn't know like i know we voted on it that we were going to present it but then it didn't end up on the meeting i don't know how it translates from this meeting to that meeting those kayak launches oh so that was just my question the last time we spoke you said that like you're going so i think with money left over in this budget we could probably repair um but when i i told lin he was saying that it'd be best to do it as we repaired the whole fishing dock i know i know um what are you nervous about like i'm just trying to make sure you know we can do it i mean i guess when it comes to i know it's tricky when you're trying to put a new if you're trying to put a new launch on a dock that didn't yeah but how about um proposing it as while they are what is it sixteen seventh street seventh street seventh street has that that needs a full repair that and that is completely shut down for the summer because it's going into the next question right i guess how about spinning it as the same people and right have them do it as well after they're completing doing that they're also going to modify you know 2nd street and also that's a good idea we were talking about not 16 seconds three 16th is the one that had one that yes so that one that's getting done anyway and this way i don't know what is it something there was another one that somebody was telling us they wanted it well he was saying twenty twentieth and twenty fifth twenty we were talking about the one that had to be right that's all it turned yeah yeah that's what he's talking about it's got to step down on the end of it same thing but 16th headed to the side i think we should push it then i think it'd be a great benefit for i don't even have a kayak well your next neighbor store neighbor is the one that really started this because she's like we have kayaks and it's so dangerous we try to like launch it seems like and it's silly i see people carrying their kayaks and you know the tide and this and that they come through to second street and just kind of bump around until they get it right you know there's so yes they're so dangerous too they're messing around no i've i've sliced myself off yeah they're definitely more than a first aid kit yeah they're a 911 yeah i mean it would be serving they'll it'd be for the neighborhoods because there's so many people that are coming out so that that's good i mean i would say it would be a problem so people that don't live there if they park a car on the street they're going to get that's not out of our budget no so that would be a different thing yeah recommendation so i mean i'll see what lynn thinks as far as when again we do the repair on 7th street seeing what we can do to add okay i'd like to see right yeah it would be nice to see that yeah okay so you'll get back to us another thing if you could check i gave the dates to patty and she um needed to check with viewer lynn in regards to um for the blood drive you know you can only do it like every 50 six days or something like that she gave me two dates and i gave them to patti and she was generally check and see and just make sure there was no conflicting meetings or weddings or whatever but it was on i think fridays you know during the work you know when you guys are here ten to four or whatever but she has those dates so can you see so i can get back to linda all right i'll just i'll just go and ask her about tomorrow okay that would be great because then we could just confirm up and then 2020 once like oh good does anybody have anything else that they want to talk about in item number four it's always our biggie everybody good okay george you look like you have something to say i think it's great that we are starting to avoid this that we're what everything online and forward there you know yeah we're moving forward um okay so number five so this is just um it was another actually i had three people ask me about this because if you if you look at the signs for the park hours so if you look at the green spaces like say the one on in south park um it's from 6 a.m to 11 p.m it's obviously right across the street from public parking it's by indian rocks beach they can park on the beach so it's definitely not bella beach residents that are in there till 11 pm there's no lights back there so the bench just the park like standing on the sea wall out there just like hanging out yeah so it's really bad at second street and it's really bad at south park because they're so close to street parking like south park south africa no across from brown park yes so it's open till 11 o'clock and people are out there i mean i i think i used a bad word to patty because like it's dark and they're doing whatever they want back there and huh bad word yeah i kind of used a bad word but um they're doing things that they should be doing in their homes and it could be like whether it's smoking things they shouldn't be smoking or they're out there with their boyfriend or girlfriend and things because it's dark and you can't see and what i the question was why are those open till 11 because even this part closes at 9 p.m and it's not even next door to someone's bedroom window or someone's house and we don't want people here after nine o'clock but they can literally park on the street in indian rocks beach and be in that park and they're it is but like the hours if they were like less i think we'd have less of a problem because the parks doesn't close till 11. what i'm saying is you do not it's only on our end yeah because i think the hours are probably based around fishing right would you say that the hours are based on people fishing but it's pitch black i don't know what else you would do at that time yeah i mean we go fishing here it's dark but we have these lit problems you know yeah i mean i can't imagine that hasn't been why they made it so late but why can't they fish here at 11. why are the hours i don't know i'm just saying no but that's what i get that but i'm saying like the same reason you guys wanted the like it to end here at nine because i don't know i i see what you're saying yeah so the question is can we revise the hours at the parks on the south end of town if it's not a problem anymore there it probably isn't because they can't park on the street and patty said well people are walking their dogs i'm like you know what the light is right at the street if you're walking your dog in the pitch black then you're not picking up the poo either because you can't see it like it is dark backwards sounds like that's the only one that has an issue well deb finds like there's people outside of dubs peeing off the dock all the time like she will sit in her bedroom window and watch guys pee off the back like second street and it's basically like essentially first street um there is a park there that is owned by indian rock stage and there's a couple of parking spots there as well and everyone who goes to that park just runs across and it's just a green space it ends there's a sea wall there's no dock or in the dock or anything people just kind of everyone goes there they'll park there you just changed the hours just yeah so you want to make a recommendation i would like to make a recommendation that we shorten the hours to match the ones at city hall parking from 6am to 9pm or dust to dawn is that too short dusted on probably easier okay so 6am to 9pm for south park because it's his official name and then second street what is it second street and what south park is what that park is called and i don't know like going this way like what i'm assuming hours or six a.m to 11 p.m too because it's like that at 7th street yeah on your side for those little neighborhood pocket parks so it's really just a problem at the tube yeah public parking yeah oh and if they can't find a parking spot they just park on our front lawn i loved how you put the garbage cans out there for fourth of july oh it's a fun time in our neighborhood they literally park and there's a fire hydrant here and they still park in here yeah they'll park right on the front lawn so anyone who's anybody wanting to well yeah like we call and then they try to find the people and if they don't find the people then they're like oh the sheriff's department well they have to the sheriff's department handles it like we can but he has to run no you can call any total company yeah but it has to be like reported through the sheriff's department it has to be on a tow zone yeah you need to build a sciences do not park here i mean those neighborhoods that do it like that yeah we just put the garbage cans out there so they don't park on our lawn yeah kept them away yeah works good all right so making a recommendation to change hours from 6 a.m 6 a.m to 9 00 p.m on the 2nd street in south park for council tourism pm so we're just shortening it by two hours nine pm okay do we need to make a motion for that or is it just a recommendation okay i mean i guess you vote on it okay all in favor that we suggest that the hours be adjusted in the two south end parks do we need emotions i make abortion that okay perfect so and then i second it all in favor of that recommendation i will say i where was it like you guys went to sorry so that those two parks the hours be adjusted from 6am to 9pm because i'm hoping literally they just look like little like stickers like so you don't have to redo a whole new sign you can just change that 11 to a nine yeah we've done stickers on the top of those that's fine okay so it shouldn't be a big expense no not a big expense at all it's just i guess let's say that if there's some problem what let's say that doesn't solve the problem well you know what we'll solve the problem george is that if anyone's going out there at 10 pm they're going on a list and it's fine it's only if they're going noticed that it's going to be addressed do you know what i mean and what will happen is the people that live right next door if if they are in there making problems at 10 30 they really don't have any recourse if they're in there at 10 30 they can call the police and the police will come they'll still have to do the work of getting the police i mean yeah they'll call if like they're literally doing i mean i've stood there in the in the broad daylight watching kids like trying to rip their fence out of the concrete in their sea wall the people that i'm talking about that live on that green space and then they have two dogs and they literally sit there and try to feed their dogs dead fish and then like there's they she's like we get they just put up a taller fence because she's like the crazies we get in this park are unbelievable because they get people from everywhere and she's like i literally have i'm afraid someone's gonna poison my dogs she's like can we hear them out there late at night what happens if they show up at 9 30. well then they can call the police if they're doing like if they're drinking and breaking glass and stuff like that they don't think any of the neighbors are calling if they're not causing problems there is no problem but there's nothing it's happening enough where they're obnoxious um late at night where it's where it's upsetting them like yeah if that doesn't you have to call the police no no but they have recourse if it's after the park hours she can't do anything yeah if if if they're they're told they can tell them if the park is now she can actually have an address before she couldn't really have an address doesn't sound like you had to take care of because they're not with the vehicle i mean it's easy to take care of people in a park they're not supposed to be in so um i don't think anyone's calling me out just because anyone's there so i get it right as long as no one's doing any relationships i'm going out there in the morning by the way [Music] we'll yeah if the sheriff wasn't you know i mean if we change the hours and the controlling sheriff's aware that the hours have changed and they're just like aware to swing by and check it you don't even care you know to make sure it's people there i think that that'll help you know what i mean because you know on that bench because most you know they keep going back out there so i think she's just okay so um number six um just we talked about it last time as well just um if you are having a discussion with one of your neighbors or if you can just get someone to like maybe volunteer just say at the um we need six judges for the costume contest i have three people that tell me that they're interested but we need three more and then i know you work on saturday morning so we literally need one person at the head of the parade one person in the middle and one person at the end so we're going to need some more volunteers for that because we're going to have to have somebody that's like still back around like in the area kind of doing stuff so we're definitely going to need some volunteers and i've talked to people that say yes i'll help you yes i'll help you but like you know the more people we can get even if we had like three more people that would be great so just keep your eyes and ears open and just kind of maybe plant the seed because you know we don't need them for a few months so number seven all other business does anybody have anything else number eight number eight okay number eight um the next meeting time wednesday august 11th at 3 p.m is that bad but you guys can by all means when do you leave on the fourth nope i live on the side would you guys want to move it like because they're voting on the three events on the second of august do you guys want to do the meeting on the fourth i won't be here you won't be here i'm going to mark it i'm so

actually have the tara the yoga beach teacher said she would be interested in doing yoga classes inside because i did have the lady that helped us pat she's like i can't do yoga on the beach it's too unstable but if you had one in the building i would love to do it so that's kind of what made me think oh i wonder because i didn't know if cheryl was doing it or not but she isn't so is everybody cool if we try to get it would literally be what it was before just maybe two days a week whatever time works out no one has a problem with that right just yoga in the building we had it before she just stopped doing it and people have asked for it it's the same instructor no same instructor as the beach her name's tara oh okay so new instructor our new instructor that does the beach yoga she teaches at drip hot yoga so she would do like a monday wednesday maybe like 11 30 so kind of like the lunch hour thing 11 30 to 12 30. and laura said that the room is open like any time so i just wanted to let you guys know that that's kind of being talked about we got a break in the rain too so we want to dismiss really good no are you good with 330 meeting um because if you can't be here for either one we're going to keep it on because we'll still have one if there's three of us right yeah three three let me just find out what time scores keep it just on the 11th for now and then i'll shoot you in the mouth okay um oh you has a preference on the 18th versus the 11th oh and i don't care so do you care either yeah and that's fine okay 18 okay so our next meeting will be wednesday august 18th at 3 o'clock and then we do i have a motion to adjourn this meeting i"
