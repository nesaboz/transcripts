    "transcript": "call the January 18th meeting Planning and Zoning Board to order Patty would you call the roll please chair JC info president Vice chair Rudy Davis president board member Angela Berry president board member Hart McIntyre City Manager Kyle reefler president City attorney Randy Mora present and Linda Fisher for Pinellas present Brenda is yes yeah okay well we could start off with reading everybody for showing up I know this is probably one of the greatest meetings on here again might be your first meeting for the engineer so we can start off with the review of the proposed comprehensive I'm sure everybody read it from cover to cover wow very interesting reading music based on the evaluations for to be presented by Linda Fisher aicp okay well thank you you may proceed in it thank you thank you here today um with my technology work properly I want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here my agency is forward Pinellas we are a countywide agency so we work with all 24 cities and towns in Pinellas County as well as the County Government um we have what we call a county-wide plan which coordinates land use all local government comprehensive plans and Land Development codes need to be consistent with the countywide plan and we also help with technical planning assistance for local governments which is why I'm here today so I am here to help you update your comprehensive plan so as planning and zoning board members you're probably well versed in this but for General background the purpose of the comprehensive plan is to provide a policy basis for the regulations that the city adopts and other decisions that it makes from the state's perspective the purpose of the comprehensive planning process is to help regulate the growth of communities to make sure that a City's population isn't growing so fast that it's outstripping their ability to provide roads schools and so forth that's not really a problem we have in Pinellas County since we're virtually built out we're only growing by a small percentage each year from Redevelopment even though sometimes it seems like more but all our local governments still have to update their comprehensive plans every seven years to make sure that the policies are still current and to stay up to date with any changes that are made to see and then you also have to update your maps and data and the the references to any agencies or plans that change over time there are 10 elements that you have to address in your plan and that means you either have to include them or demonstrate that they don't need to be included in your city's case the only one you don't need to include is the public school facilities element your exempt from that requirement because you don't have any public schools you have to provide data on any population growth to anticipate in this case you're not anticipating a lot and that's common that's common for most communities in Pinellas County and particularly on the beaches where things are pretty stable you need to provide information about housing in your community Water and Sewer facilities recreational resources and so forth to show that you have enough of those facilities to meet the needs of your population there are four maps that you have to include at a minimum they show that you've planned for enough land use and transportation to accommodate any population growth and that you've factored in the coastal High Hazard area and the potential for flooding so that's the basic package of information that you have to provide with every update as I mentioned you have to account for any new laws that have been passed there are two that you need to address this time the big one is called the parallel flood act from 2015 and it requires you to address the effective potential flooding stormwater runoff potential impacts of sea level rise and so forth and you have to include Redevelopment principles strategies and Engineering solutions to address those issues this was a big deal when it was passed Statewide because these were not questions that a lot of communities had had addressed up to that point but as a Barrier Island community you're already doing this you have to you've been doing it for many years so it's just a matter of having the comprehensive plans spell out the strategies and Engineering solutions that you have in your Land Development code already another new law that was passed last year is called the private property rights act and that is a statement of private property rights that has to be included in your comprehensive plan just basically stating things like the government can't take your land and can only impose reasonable regulation on what you do with your land from a regulatory standpoint this law didn't change anything because those things were already law but it calls more attention to those rights as a reminder in their comprehensive and then lastly there are just a few sort of housekeeping requirements that need to be updated every seven years you need to include what's called a water supply work plan showing that you have enough water capacity to meet your existing and future population um you will get your water from Pinellas County so this isn't a requirement that's really burdensome you just need to report that the county has the capacity that they have and the very tiny percentage of it that you will will use um you have to update what's called your schedule of Capital Improvements which lists the major planned expenditures that your community has so if you're updating your storm water drainage system or enhancing a roadway anything that's over a hundred thousand dollars in any given year they want you to list that and then as I mentioned you just need to update any terminology of references that are outdated throughout the plan so as your technical consultant I've prepared a draft update to your comprehensive plan that you have in your pockets it does all the things I just talked about there's nothing subjected in that draft it just continues the policies you've had in the past and updates anything that's required by law so now as a Planning and Zoning Board it's your turn to review it you can make recommendations for anything you want to add or anything you want to say differently anything you want to take out unless it's required by law when you are satisfied with the draft you'll hold a public hearing to make a recommendation that the city council approved the draft then it'll be the city council's turn once they're satisfied with the draft they'll hold their first public hearing so then it will get transmitted to the state agency charged with reviewing the plan and that agency is called the Department of Economic Opportunity or Deo they'll provide what's called an objections recommendations and comments report or and it also goes to a few other agencies for review one of them is my agency forward Pinellas wearing a different hat another of my colleagues will review the plan to make sure that it's consistent with the pennywide plan and spoiler alert it is it'll also go to other state and Regional agencies like the Florida Department of Transportation Tampa Bay Regional planning Council and then the three communities that are adjacent to yours virtually none of those other entities will provide any comments but we do have to give them that opportunity so that process takes 60 days and if there are any objections recommendations or comments they're usually pretty minor so we'll just need to address those in the draft and then at that point the city council holds a second public hearing to officially adopt the updated comprehensive plan and that is basically the comprehensive Plan update process so if there are any questions I'll be happy to answer them I'd like to add thank you as the City attorney just to help you to understand the real the value and the importance of your comprehensive plan we're all familiar with the notion of your Constitution and the Constitution from which statutes flow and then rule making in terms of orders priority your comprehensive plan is like your Constitution for Land Development in your community in fact there are corresponding statutes portions of which were cited in Fort policies presentation that say any development that is in conflict with the comprehensive plan is basically void AB initio it and and there are judicial opinions saying development and violation of the comprehensive plan is unlawful development it may be must be torn down so if your comprehensive plan has certain restrictions any any uh property owner has the ability to bring a consistency challenge hey City went our comprehensive plan says you're not allowed to build something that is of X intensity on a lot and the city just said well we really like Elon Musk and we're going to allow them to build whatever they want a resident or a property owner could bring a challenge and say even though cities approved it they want it and a board approved it this is not in lockstep at the comp plan and my Law Firm is litigated cases based on comprehensive plan consistency and I just wish to impart to you that while a lot of this may be presented or perceived you'd be like this is housekeeping some of this we just have to do like the property rights designation um but there is a real value and and want to make sure you understand the the charge with which you're being given here today in terms of what you know make looking at your comprehensive plan it is one of the few times where you're not just making a this is the rule but you're you're laying out this is the vision this is the direction we want to go in and as you put things in a comprehensive plan they're supposed to be Land Development regulations adopted within a year of that comprehensive plan if there are amendments to reflect that so if you say well we want to see more bike paths um that's visioning but if you had something like no bike path shall be more narrow than 10 feet to accommodate multimodal Transportation because that's the direction we want to go then you're going to start seeing Land Development regs that sort of flow in that way and so I'm not suggesting you get over ambitious and start throwing everything you've ever wanted to see it's not regulating it's visioning but I want you to understand it's Vision with a purpose it's not just let's develop a mission statement there it has real legal value in this in this regard so thank you for that I just wanted to add can can this I'm new to this show I would do things will this plan can this plan even get down to address some things like architectural or aesthetic control to a degree it can you're not going to in your comp plan have only blue buildings or things like that or everything needs to maintain a coastal appearance or you know consistent given you know what I've I wouldn't say I've seen this precise provision but something along the lines of given this community's history as a fishing community and fishing Village it is desirable not required desirable that the aesthetic continue to incorporate that thing and then you'll look at things down the road and say are we putting land rag when we look at what we're putting in our code on how we build have we taken into account this comp plan visioning statement that we want to preserve the fishing history aesthetic and not go to this neon orange or something I don't know how that plays out later is a whole nother fight but you you really want to keep those sorts of things a little more broadly there are some comp plans candidly that have in there you know I think it's um there's a community that I'm aware where they have height restrictions in there for example nothing over you know x amount of feet like that might present a different issue but some communities get more granular in that the more typical language is to say shall remain consistent with the the neighborhood character the residential character um you know or the neighborhood and and um children made welcoming to to Residents and visitors those are the two statements you usually have but typically we don't see and locally we don't see detailed architectural restrictions it's just more General character are we to assume that you reviewed this document um I have not reviewed that document in full yet where it is in the process that's not I've been provided I've skimmed it to make sure we are where we say we are in the process which is innocent there are several several tiers I will certainly be reviewing it before I advise the commission on it in full um and and my my having worked with Ford Pinellas understanding how involved this process is my my review will be more to say are we running are we encountering an issue that we that may not have been anticipated for example are we regulating our duration and frequency of short-term rentals and changing something there in a way that might jeopardize some other legal protection we have I'll be looking at things like that but no at this point I have not reviewed this in full um I've reviewed it for it is it Is Well we'd say reviewed as to form it is in fact a comp plan Amendment prepared for review by this body and going through that process okay our next step is to review this yes sir situation yes sir everybody yes sir I sort of feel like Congress they dropped this thing on us and said okay the foot's going to have a meeting now it's going to take several meetings I know Patty we went through this one before and how many meetings we spent with that other we asked who we had last year yeah it'll be called us so long ago but yeah I can check them out yeah so our next step is for it to fall back on us with your recommendations and our recommendations is that the deal uh well whether you folks feel that you need multiple meetings or today's you know you've had the time to prepare in advance I've looked at this I don't see anything that I'm as a board member have concern or it causes me pause and you recommend you can you can today recommend favorably to the commission that as just from the board's perspective yes this meets and let me be clear about what you know you wear different hats in your Planning and Zoning Board and under the city's ordinances under 78-31 that says that the city recognizes the need for coordination of planning activities as outlined in the planning act and wishes to coordinate with the planning Council and under a it says that the planning board will serve as the local planning Agency for the purpose of a comprehensive land use plan because under statute you have to have a local planning agency so you're not just the Planning and Zoning Board as it ordinarily exists in this community you are the Planning and Zoning Board serving as the land planning agency who by Statute reviews and approves recommends consistency with Comprehensive plan to answer your question sir you could decide today I've looked at it or I have faith in the staff report or whatever it is and say we're good if you want to get granular and say we're going to go line by line and we got through three pages today and we'll get through another three pages the next time or whatever that's ultimately at your discretion just understanding that there are some timetables that we have to go on I don't know where we are relative to the seven years and how much runway we need because that's more administrative but I'd like to know that okay they are for the last time it was approved pardon what's the date you had for the last time I can go to Deo we are the the date is actually February of this year we are running a little bit behind responsibility for that um but it's a soft deadline if you're not amending your future land use map there's not a lot of consequence for for being late that's not uncommon at all but I do apologize that I remember I have made you run a little bit this document presently exists with the city where should we you do have an adoptive comprehensive plan and was last updated in really 2016. in front in a functioning operative comprehensive plan according to that fancy company it's useful it's here it's here it's binding it's legally effective now pin going through it myself and I hope my mower did and I'd like to ask any of my board people that went through it did they see anything that was peculiar to them there's a board go ahead Rudy well let me ask is this essentially the same describe the same conference of claimed that's on record with your recommended updates and Corrections yes okay um if you were able to print it out in color any additions are in blue in any uh proposed deletions are in red okay okay so essentially the only thing we really need to look at closely is anything in blue and red unless you want to make a policy change but I this draft does not reflect any subjective policy shifts for the city I just updated what what she's so what she's so I don't mean to use the word this way I just can't feel like a better term hedging on is what she's looking to do is saying she's coming at it from a compliance standard there's certain things you just need to address you need to update your census numbers you need to have the flood plan you need to have the property right statement and today the draft before you checks those boxes But ultimately every Community enjoys home rule and the ability to regulate itself at least for now and so to the extent uh Tallahassee continues to smile upon us and allow us to self-govern you have the ability to make policy so if for instance she's not going to address the desire for uh the operation of autonomous vehicles on your roadways or something like that I'm just picking something out of thin air and if you folks said well actually that's a really important policy for us and I was wondering where's the autonomous vehicle stuff in here where's where's that stuff then that would be a situation where you're not going to see a recommendation because that's policy that's visioning that's a community self-governing so if there's whether it's that or it's something about your beaches or anything else you're whatever visioning exists there as policy objectives if you folks say I read our policy objectives but I feel like it's missing X that doesn't have to do which is strict statutory compliance or Regulatory Compliance that's going to come from you folks or the commission um or a resident who's Sue May comment or observe the meeting process and say why is nobody talking about this okay Patty do you have anything to add in this no for us okay any other board members would like more time to go over this well I do think that we should go quickly through the pages and look for the blue and reds and look those as a group that we see this we have no objection to it can be a pretty fast process but I do a quick release need to take that stuff I'm watching my family it's I agree with you yeah but fundamentally I've got a question about this once this is we've we've gone through this it gets approved makes its way all the way through Council what's the obligation of the Council of the city the management of it to buy buy this in a is a strict form is it simply a kind of a soft guide we're going to look at this we're going to review it but we can justify doing things that are bending this to some extent I will as the legal counsel answer that question to the extent there are clear requirements that are not policy objectives but clear strict regulations especially those regulations that then find themselves codified in the Land Development regulations which is the next tier of it you don't get to play fast and lose with that reasonable Minds can disagree on what any planning document visioning document says and so you will find instances where they say if somebody reads this says I'm not sure that the construction of this skate park is consistent with our flood mitigation you're adding all this cement and we said this and this and this and I find as a as a board member when I passed this this was exactly the kind of thing I was worried about and staff can look at those and say I see those policy objectives we also have policy objectives that say we're going to provide for recreation for our guests invisor and then you're going to have those fights so so I will tell you that nothing in this world is absolute however to the extent it's a codified restriction that is memorialized in your Land Development regulation we don't get to just ignore those things issued in violation of your code are employed there you don't have in order to go deviate from the code you need a variance but when you're talking about the policy objective side we want to preserve the historical nature we want to preserve these small town feel continue to provide Community Gathering spaces these are overarch and visioning statements and how somebody makes that narrative align with whatever they're proposing or doing is a different question so the more specific that this becomes the less latitude there is to play loose with potentially yes with the understanding that your comp plan is not to be so specific generated because it is I'm just trying to understand they're all good questions I just I will tell you that you will start to get pushback when you say like well I want our comp plan to say that there will never be a house within 10 feet of the setback well that's not really what a comp plan is for that's what your Land Development regs are for and even then you say and a variance looks like this because hey it's a pie shaped lot and so there's another committee couldn't do that exactly [Music] so we're going to have to have a couple meetings but Woods are absolutely deadline well again well again there's no absolute absolutely good that's all that's all I want to hear the Tallahassee is going to want to see that you're advancing the ball that you're not neglectful of your and they're going to say we had a meeting we found consistent with planning we wanted to have a second review but we fully wall our deadline maybe February 15th we anticipate having a draft to you by March 2 or something like that they want to make sure that you're doing that why would you pick February 15th mine we're both hopeful Romantics I would like the feeling of the more that we uh don't rush into this that we have another meeting within two weeks give us a chance to read it and make our notes or do you meet you'd be longer or shorter personally I've gone through it I think jump into it start doing the business to get through what we can today yeah we don't I mean what's the point of having a meeting if we're not going to sit here and start tackling some of the issues I think Rudy's suggesting is good let's start with the basics go through to see if the the recommended changes or something that anybody um that takes exception with if you get endorsement then move on to specific critical issues is there any objection on the left here hello um we're going to essentially do our thing here and then go Council would it not be wise to have counsel come in here one day and say we looked at this we're going to recommend this and then the board has some feedback on that or is that to be on their scope I would see from a practical standpoint that's really really difficult just logistically speaking because the that body would also have to have its notice meeting and now we're we're conferring with two bodies at the same time in a meeting and coordinating those schedules from an administrative standpoint that's challenging to say nothing of the way the process is presumed your your first tier review you send it up they'll they'll get everything else over the finish line and ultimately your advisory their binding so you're here to get to say hey we we vetted this for you we it's a little bit of a shortcut where's another set of eyes who did a first tier review for you here's what we think you guys if you're going to do the job right here's what you should look at and then they'll do without what they wish so I don't know that there's a lot of value in them coming back to you and saying we're okay with it because that'll just candidly add administrative delay okay understood how much do we have to get public input resident input to them uh we're doing it we're having an open meeting it was noticed if the residents that's if the residents wish to be aided that's been it's been published the residents wish to there is a fundamental especially a soapbox moment uh um in our current socio-political climate there's this notion that unless we sent out a text message a postcard and invited everybody to fill out a survey that we didn't open for public comment we are open for public comment right this moment and this is going to go at least twice if not more before the commission and the Public's free to participate then and the public can send in emails and notes and or just asked to meet with Kyle or any or any one of the Commissioners between now and the termination of this process but there's not a requirement that we go door to door or openly solicit everybody to come very specific hey these what are your thoughts on bikes and what are your thoughts on on beach gardening and that's not the process it's not practical by the Constitution yeah so open a crowdification of what's really exists so there can't be any inventions um Kyle and Patty as staff what what what's your comfort level but we just go through this and look at the red and blue comment make sure we don't have any objection do you think that's a good process or do you want to see more items I think that's a good process to start with I think it'll maybe facilitate some issues might come up as you're going through it it might run some other some other ideas I've already reviewed mainly all the data that she put together um and compared it to what I had and we've made some adjustments based on like some of the maps the which lots are no longer vacant um some some information I had from our rental registrations just for the rental information so we try to make it as accurate as possible so yeah that's already yes because you're okay well let's I'm satisfied with us hanging around for a while everybody else doesn't have to I don't know I'll go over it and go from there so it is where we go read each one of the blue and red out loud I think so I think we'll prove it in a check or I kind of think okay if we can do that point record Kyle is city manager no longer entering yes sir yes sir okay I will fix that instruments please I said nice job Kyle [Music] any comments from the public from the public I like the fact that you're moving forward I think you should take advantage of the consultant's time the outside resources they've done a lot of the preliminary work we have a comprehensive plan we've had one for 30 something years if not longer I think you have personal thoughts that probably will come up later but I think in the spirit of time and timelines you're doing the right thing by moving forward with red blue approvals and then get into the meat and potatoes if you have other visions that you'd like to see the city address okay that's what I thought foreign sounds good to me all in favor with our board say hi hi okay so we're going from there okay so you want to start with the goals objectives and policies okay this is the adopted portion the the goals objectives and policies and a few of the maps are the adopted comprehensive plan we'll talk later about the data and Analysis which are the statistics those are an unadopted appendix and there are a couple other maps that are deducted but this is this is the meat uh of the conference of planning process do we have that property here you have all that in your package uh yours are Cliff Notes I'm sorry I don't understand go ahead okay um [Applause] yes I am so the first uh the first edit is on the bottom of page future land use element and that's just a simple I updated the way it is policy 1.1.6 so this is the goals objectives and policies documented says it's under the goals and objectives so you gotta go back this way no the other way plumbers there yeah when I steal my page I think my documents are just in a different order than yours okay so it's page three it says future Landing settlement at the top um the last policy on that page 1.1.6 all I did was change the the way the maps are cited and that's that's consistent throughout the document Percy okay so your future land use categories are the same as they've always been with one exception on page seven you did not have an impervious impervious surface ratio standard for the institutional category so I added one for you and this follows I mentioned earlier that your comprehensive plan has to be consistent with the county-wide plan so I just use the county-wide standard now you can further restrict any of these standards in Your Land Development regulations so if you only want an ISR of 0.55 in your zoning categories this doesn't conflict with that can I asked her questions sure the perfect surface means something that will not pass more correct our paper driveway is considered impervious or non-re-purpose they're they're imperfect so they do not pass water count against study because I brought this up in previous review code review um there are some that serious papers they pretty much put papers through the entire property and when exceed 0.85. so the the code was adjusted um for residential low um that has the same ratio requirement um and since that code was adjusted we've been taking in taking the permits for anything that will change the impervious surface ratio and that's checked anybody it's already Beyond 0.85 is Grandfather again we're going to Oregon um I believe I'd have to check the ordinance I don't think of it said anything and if it would go back if it was a reference to people who are already in violation or not sometimes I'm like I know what the shed ordinance it said if you currently have a shed that it said that you were going to get violations so that'll be interesting yeah so this is just for the institutional future lenders category so properties like this one that would be available that's the only one okay yeah so have you covered everything in papers yeah um and then I wasn't sure if you were going with uh you know there are at one point there was pervious uh concrete pervious um asphalt and approved painters but then um I think the science over time has proven that they they're pervious to a certain point and then they've stopped being previous so with Swift Mud they've changed sort of their regulations on what they qualify at this point and really this is the power part of our process is to review to whether we don't have people who confine compliance that that is is what stands in that there's County or state it's a county-wide standard so you're not legally able to exceed that standard anyway okay it was just missing so I just added it for completion we could reduce it though you couldn't yes if I go over something if we wanted you could it makes more sense to do that in your zoning districts though or um where you have more finely Grant control you can reduce it in here if you want but um ultimately it's your zoning District so it'll control what the maximum imperative surface ratio is so I guess where I'm having a problem is trying to decide whether we should be involved in the conversation or setting in a standard here or less than is that what really we're really here to do or should that be passed on the council and other bodies that will be beside planning its own code enforcement or something like that or counseling itself and you see where I'm going here or I see where you're going I mean ultimately you folks have the ability to give input on any element that you wish um what it's my understanding and forgive me if I misunderstood you to the extent you're discussing the ISR in previous surface ratio right now your exclusive exclusively talking about it in the institutional zoning District while ISR will come up again and again later right now the page you're looking at has to do with just basically the land this building is built on and that's it and so unless you have particular concerns about this complex and its impervious surface ratio being more restricted further or less I would suggest that you can continue to move along ISR will come back later but again as as um forgive me and last name again Miss Fisher has indicated even if you don't address it here and you just say generally speaking we wish to see I we wish to see the impervous surface ratio limited to continue to control storm water mitigate flooding and address climate change or something like that your ldrs your Land Development regulations is really where the Weber's going to meet the road on that no comments okay continue approach okay so another edit on page seven was just more housekeeping under policy 1.1.7 there was a table without explanation so I just added a sentence to explain what it is where is the difference between single family and multi-family where does that fall now you won't see that in your future Landers categories um I don't believe your future land use category is typically just speak in dwelling units per acre so generally if it's about seven and a half or below is typically single family and then above that you can start getting into town homes or um but I don't believe we spell out we say low density residential manner so if you have a duplex or why is that controlled by this that is not controlled by the comprehensive plan that's something you would regulate through your Zone Industries well I just made a grammatical change on page eight and policy 1.1.8 9 UM so this is another amendment to be consistent with the countywide plan and this just states that you're not going to put nursing homes hospitals convalescent homes in the coastal High Hazard area or mobile home parks in this case the coastal Hazard area is your entire city um so that's it was already not allowed per the the countywide plan and this is just how to find them correct do we want to if we have issues on this page do we want to do that we want to get through the red and blue first and then come back no specific issue yeah I had a question about policy one 1.2.2 on page nine what what is it that's being contemplated here in the Redevelopment of the Beach Marine why does that mean s that is language that you had already in the plan so that would be a policy issue that you would need to talk about as a city um if you what does it mean when it said what Redevelopment I mean that it just stood out to me because it means potentially that thing's up for whatever people decide to be done with it as opposed to just leaving it as a marine that's the way I read it out there I'm just curious yeah that's the way I read it as well so it sounds like it's got to stay a marina um does it say it's got to stay as a Marina says it shall complement the existing but is it saying it has to stay as a marina it's not saying that and this can this committees say we think it it's something that brings value and long-term Vision that it should say that way Redevelopment of the marina could mean either further expansion as long as it's Marines or or it could mean redeveloped to another use so what if what if the vision here was have a discussion and go we think the best thing to do is make sure this stays as a ramp because there are some people who obviously take advantage of it and they've moved to the area because I I don't have any skin in the game but it just stood out to me and as much as you phrased it as a hypothetical if this body said that that was what you would what you would like to see some language like that to that effect what would happen is in the report given to the commissions that they've reviewed the comprehensive plan with Ford canalsa's insights they found it consistent and they added the following recommendations policy 1.1.2 Marina Redevelopment consider restricting to only Marina Construction again your advisory and you're providing recommendations for the commission on here's her notes here's the stuff we added and so it would look like that it wouldn't necessarily it wouldn't necessarily result in amended language because ultimately the commission is the policy maker but that's what would happen on this or anything else we're going to have your list of recommendations that come out of this so if you should just type your list of what you want to add as a recommendation so I'm confused so are you saying you want to change that so that it it it can't be anything than a Marine all I can do is bring my you know whatever I come to the table with I moved in from Fort Lauderdale for about three years three years saw things happen there that dramatically changed what was going on down there and not to the better and so that's you know when I moved here and I saw the air I got oh this was this is beautiful and and playing all the cards on the table I got involved in this because as far as I'm concerned we've got to keep it as close to this as we possibly can and I know that some people come into this maybe they don't want to keep a boat behind the house or they they can't There's an opportunity I think that brings value in the in the great scheme of things I think that brings value to our community we don't I hate for that to become a restaurant and we've got restaurants on either side we can get to them without any problem at all but that's just a personal feeling so everything I look at here is you know what's my perspective on I would hate to see happen here what happened in Fort Lauderdale and I looked down on the Las Olas on the aisles that one time it was a beautiful little area but just no plane couldn't handle it it just got to be too crowded too many mcmansions and I know exactly where you're coming from and and there's several committees that get involved before if we'd even reach that period Well I hope so but we're adjustment the permit department I can see several no but there are I could come up with examples where I go yeah we've got something being built that really doesn't fit in but it's specific to this Beach Marina what I was asking is it possible that we could come in and say you know what we want that to stay a a marina in perpetuity so you could I think you can do that for legal clarification we can say that as a vision but you can't really this documentary this document wouldn't Fetter the way you would usually do it is say it is the vision that they should and ultimately you can't bind every Commission in perpetuity that way no um but you and nor would generally speaking to use an analogy you you this the commission is the parents of a community rarely will you as parents find yourself in a way to say under no circumstances will we ever move out of this house and say we will do everything we can to stay in this house but you know and so you know you do everything you can and then hey yeah you put an irrevocable trust but then so hey we fell on hard times we gotta offload this asset it's all we got it's just so question I'm not trying to make it out no it's a good question and I think it's a good it's a good example is it's just a vision our vision is we'd like to see this Arena stay here as part of what this community is all about and then if the controls the codes or whatever come after that well they're saying this is what they want how do we bring that into code I don't think there's a perfect to it bad words but but if we dwell on that all the existing boards and exit I've been in the county in this city for 23 years and every time anybody mentioned anything every Committee in the world came about okay same opinion so I'll give you a little outside perspective wait let me see wait a minute and I think if we should go on each little thing like this until we get further down the road we're going to be here until midnight yeah I think the process we're talking about what's the process we're going to go through this and he's going to maintain his notes yes and after this work on the back seat you try to give an opportunity to bring up something they want to have we'll have another session we're waiting but formulate right I'm just trying to understand yeah this is foreign well there's not open for public discussion is it um ultimately this is a meeting of the body public comment is allowed at some portion the gentleman has had an opportunity to comment it's really up to you as to how how we're operating a little more fast and loose here than a Year's structured ordinary meeting might work ultimately when you open it to public comment is at your discretion if you said we're going to go through all these and then we'll take public comment or you're going to take them one-on-one based on the level of attendance as your your discretion is chair sir I would rather stick with the pattern that we're using and use comment at the end okay all right so continue please okay on page 10 of the future Landing settlement there are a number of changes that we're just updating the name of my agency and the name of the county-wide plan and kind of AD plan map and that continues on page 11. yes it is okay and there is a typo an objective 2.1 which I will face thank you it's my type old lady um okay so that is the future Landis element um the next edits are on page 13. um and at the top of the page it's number eight under policy 1.1.1 and that is just updating again the responsible agency um for the multimodal impact fee ordinance which is something you adopted last time with the comprehensive plan uh and that's just basically a transportation impact fee and then I made another uh update to the name of my Agency on the bottom of page 13. so these are not substances oh okay okay page 14 again there's uh if you'll see forward Pinellas in blue over and over because we changed our name in 2016. um policy 1.2.3 was just grammatical changes in reference to a map that wasn't there before until one day right and that policy 1.2.3 was very long so I split it into two policies so I've renumbered the ones under it and policy 1.2.6 and I just made that more General to refer to Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard I crossed out motorized and non-motorized transportation needs and I moved the the non-motorized this is just reorganization I moved The non-motorized Pedestrian and bicycle transportation to their own objectives and policies objective 1.3 says the city shall seek opportunities to increase Mobility for pedestrians and bicyclists and that was really just rephrased from policy 1.3.1 when you talk bicep was pretty limiting that to strictly a non-motorized non-melt whether it's electric or gas strictly a true bicycle or is it mixed I didn't make that distinction so in this context it could be either yeah I'm gonna come back now yeah you got it in there fifteen okay yeah that's the same part of that organ organization page 17 you need to adopt what's called a level of service standard for water sewer garbage and storm water your standards have traditionally followed whatever Pinellas County adopted to your standards of traditionally followed Pinellas County so I've just updated the standard stand is here to match Pinellas County and it's consistent with your new water supply work plan which you will see on the next page that's this table in blue you didn't have this before and this isn't something you absolutely have to have I believe before it just had a policy that said we defer to the county I have a contact that Swift Mud who gives me this spreadsheet so I can make it look really nice so I just did this this basically says the same thing as we're going to follow the county but it just says it in numbers if you don't like this you don't have to have it that put it back on 17 for free potable water across from 120 to 71. right and I base that on the water supply work plan I don't understand that we're all using more water than restore I mean putting a restrictions no um again I just followed the numbers um but if you're not comfortable with that it can remain 120 and I can take that table out again you don't have to have this we are forever beholden to be part of the Pinellas water supply correct how do we how do we use it and it's a division look at what's going on out Scottsdale right now the Scottsdale has said we're shutting off water to communities outside of Scottish do we need to be preemptive not the Florida's going to go through the same thing we need to be preemptive in some way of saying our business will always be dependent on it because there's houses out there now that cannot get fresh water on the outskirts of Scots great um the reason that Scottsdale is able to do that is because their their towns and subdivisions on the outskirts in Pinellas County we are all intertwined if you look at it it's not anything it has to be looked ahead five or 45 years no if if you look at a map of the unincorporated Pinellas County it is Swiss cheese all over the entire Peninsula so even if they wanted to shut off water to other communities I don't believe it would be physically possible but if you want to add that statement you can but it but there are already policies about how you receive your water from Pinellas County and you will continue to do so in the future but these numbers are accurate so you're confident this this number she gave you or the swigma gave us an accurate number okay but if you don't have to adopt that standard again I based it on a spreadsheet but if you'd rather for Comfort level stay with 120 you can do that when do we make that decision at the end when we do the recommendations or right now you can make that decision right now I'll make a note of it I'm not comfortable with going down to 79. okay don't give it us if you don't have it that's huge the the purpose of this isn't to bind you to only providing that much water it's just to show that you've planned for that much that you've Glenn have sufficient water for your population but I'm going to go ahead and revert to the language that you had that policy 1.1.4 and I'm going to go ahead and strike that too okay everybody good for that I'm good okay so what about the sanitary sewer is that 11 and up right but if you if you take this whole are you taking the whole thing away just this table this is just potable water oh this is a good sanitary sewer right the sanitary sewer standard is just a numeric standard that the county has in their pump plan okay so there's nothing like this okay okay page 19 I just spelled out Southwest Florida Water Management District I don't like to see acronyms policies but that is a stylistic choice and if you would prefer the acronym one that is perfectly fine page 21 um was just oh let's see policy 1.1.7 at the top of the page um indigenous oh okay I apologize I skipped page 20. skip page 20 uh policy 1.1.6 um and that was just a grammatical change I think that's already been covered by the city councils 1.1.6 yeah it doesn't say anything different substantively no than it does now I just changed the grammar a little bit to if I didn't like the way it was worded again I did make some stylistic changes and that was also the case for policy 1.1.7 it just said manatees in the area of the city and I just said near Bellar Beach less than four feet depth restriction that was all right that was already in there and I just left it so we could see blue okay there is what they're what they're saying here is anything people in the forefoot they're not going to restrict any speed limit but we've got a slow speed minimum weight Zone that goes out 300 feet into Clearwater Harbor from my city wall and I know that there's a 15 foot depth around the perimeter that is deeper than that plus it's 670 as you get out there and that area from those buoys to my sequel is exactly where all the manatees come through and [Music] we need to keep that restriction based on distance not wateredness of water this may have been old guidance that's just been in your plan for a long time um so I will update that language Humanity to read it's not really it covers not only Humanities but Thai afterwards yes everything else that swimmers that come through myself okay I will update that language I got it okay 22. uh well uh just a couple other again grammatical uh edits on 21. page 22 policy 1.3.1 I updated uh the uh the language about the out-of-county category 5 hurricane standard evacuation of 16 hours follows the state statute we don't meet that in Pinellas County um but it is a statutory requirement that you include that in there let's try to find we move on to the next one okay and policy 1.3.4 um this is part of those parallel flood act requirements that I mentioned in my presentation where you have to talk about disaster preparedness flooding preparedness uh and one of the requirements is um for Emergency Management so I just added a couple policies about that here these are typical policies that you see in plans around Pinellas County just states that the city will participate in annual hurricane preparedness seminars and um uh uh and shall coordinate between County and state emergency response agencies I want to say maybe I got that language somewhere else from your code and I just used it possibly not [Music] um for the parallel flood act requirements I tried to just stick to things that your city already does or that beach communities generally already do in Pinellas page 23 um again I just spelled up Coastal High Hazard area scrambled it out yeah um policy 1.4.5 I crossed out because that is covered in other policies elsewhere and then I just changed some of the map map citations to just update the numbering good with that page okay okay so now we get into the meat of the parallel flood act requirements on page 25. um City shall reduce the exposure to human life and public and private property to natural disasters through preparedness planning and implementation of Hazard mitigation measures that's verbatim from the statute um so I said that for the policies you'll designate an emergency management coordinator you recognize that the entire Community is located in the coastal Hazard area and the 100 Year floodplain and that you will enforce all appropriate federal state and local Coastal Construction Control line requirements you already do that um policy 1.8.3 again uh talks again about the hospitals nursing homes convalescent homes uh not being allowed in the post Ohio Hazard area objective 1.9 says that through its plan development code the city shall Implement development and Redevelopment principle strategies and Engineering Solutions again that's verbatim from this statute so the policies are land that is subject to flooding conditions and deemed by the city to be topographically unsuitable shall not be plotted for residential occupancy you wouldn't have done that anyway if it were unsuitable for residential development and you're not really doing any new plotting these days anyway so again that just reflects what's already been done [Music] questions at any time well do we want us I have a question about 1.9 okay and it's it's really it just brought to mind the question does this talk about flood damage but is it possible to worse than this somewhere to address undergrounding and utilities oh boy there's a can of worms well I mean you look at what happens in a hurricane and if you've got above ground we're at a greater risk than if we put it Underground but I don't know if we have any control over that because this is an ongoing situation with the city it's a study that's never quit it's still going on so what that typically looks like in a comprehensive plan again this body and this plan is not going to commit the city to the Capitol outlay Etc but what you would look like look at provided it's consistent with the element that we're in is if if undergrounding is consistent with the element of the of the comp plan that you're in is the city will continue to improve and Harden its infrastructure relative to I mean hurricanes and other weather events including such measures as undergrounding and that shows a policy objective that this is the direction we'd like to go but it doesn't bind you to Capital outlay and that's that's again this is a visioning document so if we say as a community that's a Direction that's a vision I'd really like we we as a body would really like to see the city commission consider that's a perfectly appropriate thing to put in a comp plan but more in and you don't you folks don't have to finesse the language you could just say we'd like to see a policy objective on that accounts for exploring undergrounding that would be an an appropriate thing to do something continue please okay um I skipped over policy 1.9.2 just says that propose new development shall be designed to minimize flood damage and be reasonably safe from flooding and you have to do that anyway again under the Florida building code and the national insurance program um 1.9.4 for new development in flood zones ah and AO adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and adequate drainage paths will be provided to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures um 1.9.4 and I believe I took that for near Land Development regulations yeah we don't we don't have any ah radios okay but I guess it just has to be there that may have been older language Let me let me check that and make sure that language is current um okay but again this these policies are intended to codify what you're already doing objective 1.10 the city shall encourage the use of best practices development and Redevelopment principle strategies engineering Solutions you've heard that phrase several times that's from the statute um that will result in the removal of coastal real property from flood zone designations established by the Federal Emergency Management agency that doesn't require you to do to knock down houses but it just says that you will generally follow best practices if there is a FEMA set of repetitive flood policies and FEMA wanted to come in and explore the idea of purchasing and knocking down those houses just as the city will generally follow those best practices uh policy 1.10.1 the city shall explore opportunities for federal state and local assistance with public acquisition of properties that suffer extensive storm or flood damage again that's the same sort of thing policy in 1.10.2 sure uh the city shall consider one or more of the following strategies in those areas which receive major or moderate flood damage relocation reduction of permissible density or intensity or reconstruction and compliance with current building and construction standards or public acquisition that's just a standard menu it says the city shall consider so it doesn't bind you to those but generally if you're having repetitive flood properties in the city wants to explore how to address that that gives you a menu of what they would do okay where would you address she will hide set up right but you have a vision on it on it look forward to it we're going to have Rising water well I I I'm sure that I've been hearing that for 20 years my mind is actually going down a little it depends on the winds from the west and I don't know free should even even that suggestion but I don't see us as well unless you don't want your community Islands typically in the way they control it over there as they've looked at what your mean height was above whatever the new measurement is for water well I think we're just talking about that all day and we catch you can't control that and neither can this will work if you look ahead to policy 1.10.4 we talk about erosion control structures so that might be where it comes in okay so again you're laying out the general guidance that's how we stop the traffic from Clearwater to keep Iowa from shaking yeah we build a thing right across yeah but this might say if there's too many people going on the beach yeah yeah come on folks all right objective 1.10 City shall identify site development techniques and best practices that reduce loss losses due to flooding and claims made under flood insurance policies that's from the statute policy 1.10.1 the city shall prohibit the alteration of sand dunes or Mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage that's pretty standard language flood insurance you know what you know that is so screwed up now we don't none of us know what's cool Okay carry on please um 1.10.2 the city shall control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers that help accommodate our Channel flood waters control filling grading dredging and other development that may increase blood damage and prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas that is there I see it's there so this state policy saying the city shall control the alteration right yes the the state statute directs you to um they refer to it generally against those engineering Solutions and then you can more specifically choose what engineering Solutions you want to use in the town but that's a pretty standard set of them you're not doing a lot of dredging and channeling on the Barrier Islands these days okay 1.10.3 the city shall encourage retrofitting of existing structures to mitigate potential damages from natural disasters that's pretty straightforward 1.10.4 the city shall continue to coordinate with the Pinellas count with Pinellas County and the Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate the feasibility of beach renourishment erosion control structures or other mitigation to preserve and protect the beach beachfront from erosion and the potential effects of sea level rest so you're already yeah um but you'll you're already coordinating with the Army Corps of Engineers and you'll continue to do that going forward 1.10.5 the city shall consider the findings of the Pinellas County sea level rise and storm surge vulnerability vulnerability assessment to help identify and mitigate there's an extra word in there extra couple words properties vulnerable to flooding where is that study um I will get you a copy they should have given the county should have distributed it to all the local governments have you seen that study okay me too so objective of 1.11 there's a weird phrasing in the statute that says it just says something like encourage other encourage local governments to participate in the National flood insurance program which is something that the state should be doing but it's in a place of a list of things that say what the city should be doing so I interpreted that as the city shall participate and encourage other local governments to participate in the National phone insurance program you don't have to go out knocking on doors it's just generally anybody participants everybody yeah everybody participates in the community rating system and um do you take part of the local mitigation strategy group that Dallas County has it so I would say your job is done with that policy not just for Saudi rates discounts um policy 1.11.1 says that you'll continue to be a participant in that program and work to maintain or increase your rating which you're already doing you really don't have a choice I mean it almost makes it sound like this is a choice thing we don't have a choice you don't have to be in the CRS Community rating system program that gets you a discount yeah and you can be as aggressive as you want to be yeah yeah the state statute encourages your continuing participation um 1.11.2 says you'll provide information about the national flood insurance program on your website and I believe you do that already float elevation certificates and things that you're required and then that's also covered in 1.11.3 that you post your elevation certificates on on the City website okay so that's the big fish Funk of new content and again it's fairly boilerplate from the state statute things you're already doing or things that are pretty standard uh there was one change in the recreation open space element and that is on page 30 I added the word the to a sentence your intergovernmental coordination element is just about how you interact with other local other cities and towns the county my county-wide agency the regional and state agencies and the only changes I made to that were to update for Pinellas name and then um and then I just made some grammatical changes to 2.1.1 again I don't like to say acronyms if they're not being used they're not needed okay um page 33 uh again Ford Pinellas um in addition to coordinating land use and providing technical assistance we are also the Metropolitan planning organization so wherever I think that just acknowledges for Pinellas in its role as the Metropolitan planning organization and that's for transportation planning I'm sorry just for transportation um the Metropolitan planning organization that's a strange name but it's just for transportation planning so historically in Pinellas County you had the Pinellas planning Council which governed land use and the Metron funding organization which govern transportation and they never talk to each other but we have merged so we are now forward Pinellas so we coordinate land use and transportation everywhere we possibly can so um at the time your plan was updated we had just merged so that's where you see the mpo slash PPC but we hadn't yet rebranded as Ford Pinellas so I'm rebranding it in here at the end of this are you opened the discussions with you about your organization and yeah absolutely in particular what's happened at Clearwater Beach what it's caused a lack of its infrastructure they put in place to properly handle the problems they've created for us traffic wise Etc I can talk about that if you'd like I'm I caution you that I'm not a transportation planner I'm a land use better but I can take notes on anything you want to talk about and I can take it to my Transportation colleagues okay I can talk about that too talking about the beach by Design it's a state of them and us and we can only build a one-lane bridge or a two-lane Bridge and been allowing the development that far exceeded the capacity of those structures sorry we can talk about that if you'd like okay at the end all right sure um so that of all of the page 33 edits are really just grammatical or updating the name of the organization um and then on page 34 the continuation of policy 2.2.12 talks about the planners advisory committee and I just um noted that that is a staff level organization so if you'd like Kyle if you'd like to come to clutter's advisory committee meetings you're welcome to do so um normally we have like planning plan of directors and planning staff at those but for local governments that don't have planning um any anyone else building officials city manager anyone else who wants to attend it's always invited thank you um on page 35 all I did was really move the location of your Capital Improvements table because I thought it looked better spread out so I I scooted that over so it could take up its own pace um and this the schedule of Capital Improvements just we talked about that in the presentation is Major expenditures anything over a hundred thousand dollars in any given year um that is spent on things like infrastructure or improvements that serve the population we just listed in here all right technically you are supposed to adopt a new one of these every year but almost no one does and they're not really any consequences for not doing so much um and then page 37 is just deleting that old schedule Capital Improvements and then just certainly rewarding those policies kind of to compensate for that page 39 those edits are just grammatical um policy 1.5.1 said all development and Redevelopment make sure it does do not result and I it was just awkward so I changed it to no development or Redevelopment results page 41 is the private property rights element that you are required to adopt by Statute and this is verbatim from the statue so there's nothing really not a lot of really wiggle rooms here and that is it on the goals objectives and policies the next section is your max and the first four maps are part of your adopted plan and that that'll be all spelled out in the ordinance we do it this way for everybody um so the maps that you are required to adopt are map one your future land use map to your transportation corridors map map three the coastal High Hazard area and map four floodplains there are a couple of other maps that that they want to see you include as part of your data and Analysis existing land use is what is built on the ground today and regardless of what the um future land use category is sometimes you can have a commercial category that will allow either commercial or residential and this map shows what what is actually on the ground today and it also shows the vacant parcels this is um as classified by the Property Appraiser's office and talking with Kyle a number originally we had a lot more vacant Parcels shown on here because new development had happened in the Property Appraiser's office haven't caught up yet okay so but we went through uh well Kyle went through and found all those parcels and I changed them and then map six is a soils map and this if we don't include this they're not actually going to care I um I always put this in here but um Kyle and I were noting that one of the finger islands is labeled beaches type soil and we don't know why that is so did we say we were going to throw this out and I just accidentally included it I mean stay finalized throw it out but but yeah this is completely options just shows that when the town was originally when the future land uses were laid down that soil was taken into account and um it doesn't really say anything but the statutes recommend including swords why I it says beaches I can tell you the finger you're referred to JC and I live on in fact three of us live on it and it was built by building a sea wall that designed and then going around and pumping the sand from the bottom into behind the state wall to build that so that may be where they got that reference of beaches yeah and that's done by the national resources conservation service which is a National Organization that I mean this data is probably from the 50s we need we don't need you all over there okay do you want me to take it out no okay okay so the data and Analysis this is your another part of your unadopted appendix so isn't it these are your Municipal limits okay is this supposed to be the marina or the purples so this is Harrison that live stream okay okay all right so the data and Analysis is all new you don't have to do a strikeout underline of this because it's not an adopted document but I based it heavily on what you had before so there's an introduction that just talks about how the city is meeting the statutory requirements um it says that uh I'm gonna have to update this because when I drafted this it was still 2022. you have to uh you have to cover what are called planning Horizons you need a short term five-year planning Horizon and then a long-term planning Horizon and that just shows how far you're looking so when you're doing your population projections which we'll get to in a minute or your housing projections you have to pick an ending year and so I picked 2045 because that was the readily available data so I say that it's a 23-year planning Horizon but since it's now 2023 I'm going to change that to 22 22 year planning Horizon and that is in the third paragraph okay so it's probably easiest to focus on the tables to go through it so your population projections um the 2020 numbers are based of course on this the most work page are you oh I'm sorry A2 and I forgot everybody's in a different order than me so I'll let everybody yeah thank you sorry about that I read it but I'm at home okay yeah so page A2 table 1 is your population projections um so that it reflects the 2020 census numbers and then the projections I took those from forward Pinellas again as our role as the the Metropolitan planning organization we have to do a five-year Transportation plan and as part of that we have to include population projections so I just took excerpts from that that apply to your city and that was the both the permanent and the seasonal and tourist projections and I just plugged them into that table um and it shows that you're only going to grow by about 67 people um um nobody's population projections no sorry nobody's population projections are ever correct this is an educated guess and how much you think that the city is going to grow in general yeah so um so this does not bind you to importing 67 people 45. Trudy will be here to ask you about it table two is existing land use and that is based on that existing land use map and that is just a percentage breakdown and that does include the updated vacancy courses that's fine you did a great job on this situation Table Three is again just a percentage breakdown of your future land use designations and how much acreage they take up table four includes those vacant parcels and if they were all developed today to the maximum that they were allowed that could result in 16 units theoretically that's not likely that that scenario is not likely but hypothetically on page A4 table five just inventories your major roadways and the level of service which is that is set on a Connie wide basis so that's just how well the roll the roads are functioning they are at level of service F so if you wanted to put in a big new apartment complex on Gulf Boulevard you might get some questions about that but since you are fairly stable that's not a thing that you really need to park we're in doing it on page A5 Table Six is your housing estimates and projections and that's just a breakdown that came from the Property Appraiser's office how many single family units you have how many multi-fending table seven is how the Property Appraiser's office I have a question okay sure um it says that we have a residential growth poem do we still have a residential third film it's the first paragraph that's a good question um did we talk about that I thought we did is that the motel I'll double check that I I want to say we looked at that but I care I think it was an Alf but I thought that she sold that but are they even check it Linda okay yeah yeah there is this was where was it I don't remember down there right 18th I can't remember exactly is Veterinary shows yeah I think so yeah I think she sold that the house all right I will check on that um table seven is how the Property Appraiser's office classifies homes in terms of condition um so as is typical everywhere virtually all your uh your houses are average or above average you do have some that are excellent mention mentioned Superior and Superior and we did identify the the Mansion imagines Superior I can't tell you the address is off the top of my head but if you like that information I can forward it it's about a map um a map of this information I could do that for you yeah okay red or something sure like like faster okay um table eight is uh what's called housing tenure and that is is the resident does the resident own where they live do they rent are they a snowbird or is the property vacant and for all of these we had information from the Census Bureau that American Community survey is an arm of the census group and we just extrapolated that out to 2045 and just assume that those percentages would remain the same again it's nothing really critical it's just data um table nine uh seasonal unit it's the the official term is held for occasional seasonal or recreational use typically that's snowbirds if you allow vacation rentals that would likely fall under that seasonal unit yeah is it 90 day yeah good right um so that's how the census classifies them okay so you can really that that's a very good step initially it probably should be divided into separate categories right the Census Bureau only puts it in one bucket seasonal recreational or occasional use table nine is cost burden households and that is anyone that is spending more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing um that is an issue everywhere um but it's it's probably better on the beach because you have retirees that own their homes maybe don't have a mortgage anymore um so I believe you're doing a better percentage-wise than the accounting as a whole but there are some some cost proteins and again we just note them and we project that out to 2045. um seven is infrastructure and that just uh summarizes where you're getting your water and I've got that 79 gallons per person per day figure there so I'll go ahead and change that I'll take that out but it just it there are requirements to talk about where you're going to get your future water supply and how you're developing future water sources and they answered one of the things I asked about earlier is it obligates them to meet the needs of member governments which Bel Air which yeah they are they are currently legally obligated um so you won't be developing your own you probably won't be drilling your own Wells or putting up a reverse osmosis facility but kind of like do those things or tip of a water in so that just that's what this section says defines the cost to do that the County Commissioners or this body um Tampa Bay water is the water supplier so they sell their water wholesale to Pinellas County so they would be the ones that are developing the resources and figure out what it costs but do they have the ability to set their own across through or if they're selling the water too they do I don't know if there are any statutory limitations to that cost yeah I can get more information on that it's not a question I've been asked questions um page A8 recover sanitary sewer and just says that you're a customer of Pinellas County utilities and that they're responsible for the facilities and um that uh yeah and it just reiterates that the level adopted level of service is 115 gallons per capita per day which is the same as the county storm water drainage is just again boilerplate language from what you had in there before you have to meet certain federal state requirements um and and I'm just cited again that was in there already so I cited that the chapter of the Florida administrative code that you have to defer to and then your level of service is based on a 25-year 24-hour storm event [Applause] um solid waste my understanding is that you are you have a private contract with Waste Management of Pinellas and you have an interlocal agreement with Pinellas County to take the garbage to the refuse to energy facility which is the same as everybody in the county and the level of service or excuse me the the solid waste demand is based on your population projections times the County's adopted level of service of 1.3 tons of garbage per capita per year and that's what that table 10 is any questions on the infrastructure no okay it's next okay great unless somebody's got any specific questions okay and um the last page again just there's just one of these sections for each element so it just sums up what each element is for so we talked about what the Capital Improvements element is for what the private property rights element is for and then the public school facilities uh that you're exempt and that letter of exemption has been on file since 2000 people are there any further questions from the board well let me just say at the end of all of this is when I'd like to discuss what happened with Dave former mayor at the time of this bridge was being built to being on the puppies and oversaw the discussions decisions that were made we had input we didn't have any the public we were constantly reminded of the state's objective so there's two lanes here and two lanese that the objective was to control the population and cost of structures on Barrier Islands and so the bridges were built and then Clearwater Beach exploded and is still exploding with high cost High residue High occupancy structures with almost no limitation and the only thing we've ever told was well Clearwater traded some of their limitations of that property through Inland properties where they're restricting growth so that they can add growth if they want to be how did that happen and find question B is there anything that they violated in their own land use limitations or statement in your simulations that we could go back and sue them and have them tear those things down and that's a big approach noted I I'm not in a position to provide anything that's good and whether private residents wishes they may wish to we can't dwell them um so you're prepared yourself that's where I'm going okay so there is a statute that limits um investment in infrastructure in the coastal Hazard area for the reasons you mentioned because we're not trying to attract new population uh to those vulnerable areas um the statutes that deal with the coastline Hazard area and the county-wide plan Provisions that deal with Coastal Hazard area talk about increases over what is allowed today so what happened is that Clearwater Beach had adopted a lot of density that they hadn't used yet and that's what you're seeing with that Redevelopment you're seeing that kind of latent density I agree it does sound like there is a mismatch between the density and the transportation infrastructure but the way it was done that wouldn't be able to be limited by the statutes or the kind of Ed plan um okay it was done in a way that would not let cloudy or state law respecting I should say I should say based on what you've told me and what I know I'm I'm operating from what I believe happened is that Clearwater had already adopted that density before these some of these restrictions were adopted into statute and and the statute governs density increases over what's allowed today but they had already allowed quite a bit of density so they didn't have to adopt new density increases they had it already they were friends I will also tell you that um so any further density increases that they wanted to adopt would need to come through forward Pinellas and you have a beach representative on our board and I apologize I don't know who the new person is it was mayor cookie Kennedy for she just had her last meeting in December right and she just was termed limited out and I apologize I don't know the name of the new gentleman who was taken over but you do have a beach representative typically they attend the Big C meetings so you can talk to that person and have them carry your concerns to the Ford Pinellas board um and I don't think there is likely a legal way to address what's already happened in Clearwater Beach but um to highlight these issues and how we don't want to see it worse than to going forward um I think that is a valid thing to convey to your representative so even though the state was saying we're only going to build these roads because we don't want to develop they are allowed to build it and not have any responsibility for increasing the capacity to get traffic going locked out the island or that their portion of that to Barry Ryland they have no responsibility to I mean that should be answered in private or that capacity this week okay you want me to stop I'll stop but what I'm just saying is there was no responsibility for Clearwater to return their own boundaries if they were exceeding State statutes or mandates or regulations to control it within their own borders they should be doing it absolutely should be doing a better job of coordinating develop land use with Transportation just what I'm talking about is the the part of the statute that speaks to development in the coastal High Hazard area um couldn't couldn't reverse what has happened okay I suppose you're getting at it from the perspective of all the traffic absolutely yeah can we because where do we get an economic benefit out and we're not going to reverse it but is there any way for us to get an economic benefit for the city to hold it I think we're on another team in someplace yeah well beyond comprehensive plan consistency I would say to to Fort Pinellas point the board member representing the beaches now is Alan Johnson he's the mayor for the city of Saint Pete Beach if you have concerns about the planning agency and the advocacy for the beaches that is best taken to that body this body is not going to it's beyond your charge and duties especially specifically in this meeting to resolve that issue it doesn't mean that your policy considerations and concerns are not valid or or deserving of attention it's just we're going to end up in talking out and sharing our frustrations and making it more of a venting session which while on some level may be satisfactory may leave you continue to be disappointed because what came of you saying it to us um and so that would be that may be the the better venue um for that one of your forward revision though is to control or mitigate the trafficking well for sure but at this stage nobody's talking about a policy proposal the conversation is this happened this is a frustration we can't we can't put the toothpaste back in the tube and so if there's a policy consideration this community wishes to to add it certainly can and I'm not in no way uh attempting to neuter the sports ability to do that and that would really fall and comp plan terms of a fall under intergovernmental coordination would mean they occur through Ford Pinellas I'm not sure I agree with that yeah and I gotta say wait a minute let me finish I'll let you finish so please could I it if we're going to spend the time here a volunteer and the idea I don't want to whitewash anything exactly is not an issue of how fast we can get through it how thorough we are with it before we say to the board we're ready to roll I think it's a critical issue of looking at the vision because if the vision doesn't Encompass somehow the fact that we've got all of this traffic flowing into here because I can't handle it on 60 and they begin using this as a thorough way here we may not be able to reverse what they're doing up there but we might be able to put something that economically makes it a burden for those people to come down here but I have to allude to the legal advice we were to take it properly that's uh well yes I think we've got to decide how to do that and that's actually just explained that I will again defer to legal counsel but I refer to the body we just give advice you folks do the work so it's going to make a suggestion sorry I cut her off I'm sorry my recommendation would be that if you want to express it in your comprehensive plan you can add a policy under either Transportation or intergovernmental coordination or both that speaks specifically to the issues that you have with the traffic coming from Clearwater Beach I can do that it would be somebody be willing to send me an email talking in his general or lengthy terms as you want about the the issue and then I will try to boil it down to policy language sorry we need to put something together and email them bring it to the group to approve here's the problem with that um whether you you know if you go home tonight and you mull it over and you write her an email and you go home tonight I just want to be very very clear for Sunshine Law reasons right um You Folks can't say hey let's let's meet let's go on a walk over the bridge and looking at all that traffic in the view we'll get we'll have our Moment of clarity and you and I will work out some joint language you can't do that um if you wish to do that separately you may if alternatively if you wish to convey the general principle that you wish reflected in policy again you folks don't have to word Smith today so you could say we would like to see a policy that calls for in the most as generically as possible this you know that calls for cooperation management and mitigation of traffic flows south from the northward beaches through our limited infrastructure right something like that then great she she can Wordsmith can you say that again yes say that again because that's perfect I mean it is on the audio recording but is that I mean certainly we can I mean if that's the consensus of the body I just was throwing out something based on just just trying to get there but if that's really if that if that sentence or fragment is generally what you wish to address is that the consensus of the body that you wish some language to that effect so this body can come with that request not that we would do it outside of the meeting but that could be a topic of discussion at this table whether it's this meeting or another meeting again it has been a topic of discussion what I will tell you I want to be clear about one thing because the way you phrased that was like we could talk about this today or we could talk about it another day if you're talking about it in the context of another day the comp plan process is marching along and so the idea that like well let's talk about that in July well the comp plan process will have have sailed by then amending the comprehensive plan is not as simple as amending Our Land Development regulation there's some other Charter I mean not Charter other some other code provision that it's we have two reading of an ordinance whenever we want to get to it right now we're we're looking at the comp plan if you ever want to do it again it goes up and down and back to the state and back to us so now would be the best time or the very very very near future but it sounds like you've had that discussion a little bit today and it sounds like there actually may be some consensus in that regard so you don't need to if you don't wish to you don't need to talk about it at a later date if you want to say the vision for this meeting what should come from it and perhaps we can do a better job in the future of of communicating this but the vision for the meeting today is what you've already done go through the blue go through the red see if we have any problems but you can also leave here today with and here are the five things we'd like to see at it um and if one of those is management of traffic south from 60 through our limited infrastructure great that can be one and if you want number two to be we want we also want to see more Recreation to include pickleball courts and ski ball and whatever else great that could be number two whatever you folks want to make your itemized wish list as long as they're a majority of you three at least today say this is what we want to see then we can recommend that out on top of yes they were totally fine with everything Ford Pinellas did but they also wish for you commission to consider adding a policy objective in Transportation on this in infrastructure on that in flood mitigation on this so if there's any other wish list items since it's seems to me that you got through everything for analysis presented anticipated discussing today if you have wish list items now's as good a time as any to say here are the other things I wanted to make sure we addressed and see if you can to quote Hamilton get the votes breaking up here because we don't have the ordinance in the packet well there's I think you're using public hearing a very specific way as here's the ordinance but it was noticed that the public meetings happening okay the public is welcome to attend as we have a member of the public present so notice the location is open to the public minutes are being taken and there's an opportunity for public participation so that all those all the elements of a public meeting have occurred whether it's a hearing on an ordinance is something different okay I would motion if we develop language from this this table in this Ward that that specifically speaks to some means of controlling traffic that flows down from Clear Water and and impedes on our environment here and that we somehow find a way or explore ways to gain economic benefit if nothing else we want to control it reduce it and if we can find it for example it's like Sanibel Island you don't get on and off that without going through a toll now that may bring up all sorts of a bad mojo but is there a way for us somehow mitigate this traffic jam everybody here knows you can sit up on this this bridge here's her now we're trying to get back home yeah or get out or you've got people speaking through this community going too that's right and we need to do something about it if we don't do it now 10 years 15 20 years from now it's going to be a fast one and a half totally hard to formulate dead into motion you got that already no I'm I'd like for some help on doing this but Kyle in and you um you see the issue so we've explained it the impact of Clearwater Beach and the traffic going to and from that Beach it can't be handled on Earth within their own infrastructure it's now coming through us and using outrage to get back or get to Clearwater Beach Way Beyond what this road was designed for and what our intended use of this room before we can't even get out of our own side streets on the Gulf Boulevard without significant weights and then pair with the air travel why is that the issue as well even within the community that's under discussion right so we're getting online here we've got a motion right that we want to do this wait a minute wait a minute now we got a motion we need a second motion is again that we we explore a means of controlling the traffic coming southbound from Clearwater coming westbound cross Bel Air Causeway that we look at ways that the county can help us control this traffic flow so that our road capacity is not exceeded and that we can if possible and post some economic really gain penalty whatever you want to call it make it too damn expensive to come travel down this way to generated to Clearwater Beach by that they pay us for the privilege of it or something you know that's okay what I would recommend is wait a minute I got emotional oh I apologize so we need a second then we can have discussions I said all right now discussion but you're not on the boulevard but you have permission thank you what I would suggest is under the transportation element to add a new objective and policy since this is a new topic area that doesn't really fit into what's there so a new objective and a new policy to talk about what you've said okay are you going to help us with that wording yes do you want to come up with the wording right now verbatim or do you just want to tell me okay you have a sense of what we're looking for yes we can take all the wishlist items and perform policies and then bring them back to another meeting for approach okay well you should contribute I don't know that you need to contribute to that unless you want to but I have to have a vote although it's in Fair all right motion carry we make a note to all this so I'm unclear on whether we're having another meeting of the planning board after this or whether we're taking care of it today I can work with you where you don't have to come back to the next meeting oh I'm happy to I'm happy to come back it's just a little schedule yeah yeah I I'm absolutely happy to do that that was my expectation that we were going to do that um Randy seems to indicate he wants to see it taken care of today but what's the advantage timing notice required for our next meeting um 10 days 10 days so our next meeting cannot be before 10 days from now right it's a little set it for 11 days or whatever what is 11 days from now if you have to be we could do it again on the first very first versions what's the event what's a good day the first is Wednesday yeah and how do you notice the meeting do you put it in the paper or yeah it could be anywhere from the 30th yeah [Music] we'll shoot for Wednesday the first 1pm at one o'clock I don't know if we're going to do anything else I want to eat without your two minutes your third more for your comments I sat in that seat in 2008 I did a comprehensive plan for the city I want to emphasize the importance of it a couple things came up earlier you were talking about Marina my comment wasn't specifically to give guidance on Marina it was to emphasize that there is language in the comprehensive plan that does get direct let's take an example if you go through it if a motel goes down in a hurricane Leon let's name it that it strictly states that hotels will not go back up so you do have that right to go further on what's the vision and the importance of that is if I look back on 14 years of doing comprehensive collaborative City do we really live and read this what a beautiful comment by our attorney to say this is our constitution I never looked at it that way and I don't think we as a city do and I could go through example after example after example of things that could have been avoided in this city if we literally looked at the comprehensive plan a little more seriously and as our constitution so take the time let people voice things out I think it's I can I could go on I think there's some language if you look strategically at that Marina half of the decisions we handle about every two years could be avoided if we really had a vision for what does that look like is it always going to be that way or for that matter depth of water manatees look at the things that have happened in 14 years on intergovernmental it's outlined in here how we should treat our relationships locally yet we've run astray this is an important moment take it seriously underground wires I find that interesting I look back in time what if it was a part of our comprehensive plan 25 years ago that we as a city should Implement underground land today we've set precedent that the residents are going to pay for it wow is that poor big city planning so the comprehensive document is real I love the idea that it's our constitution I I think we should look at it more often than just a seven year process and I know you do as a city manager and have responsibilities and I'll just close out with Rudy's question it's valid I think it could have went further if the conversation just is allowed to happen versus not so try not to just stick to the timeline of the comprehensive plan take it seriously and thanks for all your volunteering it matters it really does great appreciate it [Music] Iranian finished business for today though we need to set an agenda for Wednesday's meeting the first I'm trying to say that again do we need to set an agenda to request an agenda for Wednesday February 1 meeting we can just continue with the review of the comprehensive plan unless you want to be more specific but you don't need yeah that's right and specifically address transportation and Mr governmental uh the transportation and financial impact transportation and financial impacts traffic to to and from Clearwater Beach well are you doing that as part of the conference at plan review right so you don't need to Signal precisely in your agenda which elements if you're just doing a complete A continuing comprehensive plan would be better for you to say we're doing the whole thing's on the table right then we're only going to look at item a of that person and someone come back and go through other points in here continuation of the agenda in making up their suggestion lists based on anything that we as a group when we see that is yes or suggested to Council in their finals and with the requisite legal admonition then you all reflect individually and come back with your own individual and insights or Collective discussion right should we send that to Patty if we had a list do we send it to Patty before the meeting or just coming in with the list he's saying we'll be as mundane as we can as an item ammunition for her what we've asked her to bring through us we need to eat in this issue of transportation and financial impact right I think I got the gist I was a little unclear at first but I think with the further discussion I think I have what I need we want to put steel barriers out there so I will take all the comments that you made here today and the things that we said we'd revise and I'll create a new draft and send it to you all ahead of that meeting yeah deferred illegal concept thank you I put you before unfinished business so sorry about that that's okay buddy on the next agenda can we add a review of a ordinance that we've discovered um some air staff is asking requesting that in addition to the matter that you have staff has a matter of it which is to bring to you about so in once in one part of the meeting you'd be the land planning agency that's hat wearing take that once you get through all your land planning agency stuff go back to being the Planning and Zoning Board who's charged with providing any insights well any insight on proposed revisions to the Land Development code in looking at the zoning and Land Development code in the last few months administering it the city staff has discovered a typo that it can address but also the way that a particular chart is laid out in terms of permissible setbacks in the zoning District that it's not drafted and it may not be drafted ultimately it's for you folks to decide may not be drafted in the clearest way possible for administrative purposes and it's going to come forward to you with some suggested line development code revisions for you to do as the Planning and Zoning Board and so he's asking are you open to discussing that in February as well as it's a priority for staff yes there you go thank you but I would like some kind of a description early yeah you'll have materials in advance okay is there any other unfinished business so I think we're concerned about what about the time are we going to stick with more February 1st at one o'clock in the morning yeah but I'm sorry we're loosey-goosey but that's how we get things done it doesn't scare anything out of me I just want to make sure you get you get things accomplished yeah no there is there is an item on your agenda this is a brand new year we have it foreign prison and then it should be here nominations for office holder of the board so I'll entertain and uh okay I moved JC until the reelected chairs for the board there's been a motion made and stepping it is there any other nominations is there any other nominations is there any other nominations declare the nominations closed do you want to meet Kevin I'll try it again now I will entertain the vice chairman all in favor of um it's been nominated there's no other there's all in favor I understand okay okay parliamentarian for the state of Ohio understood sir yes are there other nominations wait um I thought about that and I appreciate it but it's my intent of what's this comprehensive plan was starting to retire from the board I've got family personal issues that are increasingly taking more of my time I also need to reduce my stress level for health reasons and so I can denomination to chair it would only be you need to go somewhere else unfortunately sorry come on after Carolina oh it's up to the border at this point I don't think I should be involved oh well this decision all for nominations for vice chair who once today question not me I'll submit Mr Hart what else involved huh that's too easy to go yes what all do you do is is a vice chair what are the obligations I'm sure the big sites he needs to play golf on the day that we need to report the city council and you have to do it that's about it stuff well now if you signed you something but I can I can gracefully and turn that request down yeah yeah okay is there any other complications or vice chair any other nominations for vice chair I declare nominations closed in your automatically unplice chair you ready to go well when I second the motion each second there's no other nominations it's a declaration from the chair nominations for secretary because I don't think I think that concern seems so we'll vote go ahead it's your it's your body I mean it's it's an unopposed nomination at the parliament from a parliamentary standpoint either procedure is fine um so you have a chair and of ice share um you're good to go in terms of your your secrets all those in favor but opposed nominations close and declare the meeting closed until the first few hours for adjourned to 306. I want to personally thank Linda explaining all this stuff to us again city manager and Pat for showing up and keeping us along the line and art citizens and I mean that you care I love you man closed"
