    "transcript": "[Music] good evening everyone welcome to the monday december 7th city council meeting of the city of ballarat beach before we do the pledge of allegiance tonight i have a request from a person from a citizen from a navy citizen former navy men and um we want to remember december 7th today's december 7th and december 7th 1941 over 2 000 american soldiers and civilians lost their lives and over 1 000 were injured in the japanese attack on pearl harbor at the u.s navy base so today we remember the lives lost on that fateful day and we honor the brave veterans of world war ii that fought for our great nation if you were here earlier you saw the flag at half staff that's why it was there i'm going to ask for a moment of silence and then command master chief john hansen from the navy has asked to do the pledge of allegiance and i'm going to turn my duty over to him tonight to do that so we participate in a moment of silence first thank you very much i pledge allegiance to unified in the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all thank you madam clerk would you please call rome council member robin ockey here councilmember marv beam council member dave gattis council member jody shirley councilmember rita swope vice mayor glenn gunn mayor joseph manzo city manager len reeves city attorney fred riley here and community services administrator kyle reiffler thank you first order of businesses to approve the agenda do we have a motion [Music] do it by a voice vote all in favor aye aye and one opposed pass the seven to zero next part is the citizen commons each speaker is recognized once and will be limited to three minutes presentation on any subject that is not on the agenda if it's on the agenda we're gonna get to you later there will be a time for public comment about the appropriate um error of the agenda so if it's not on the agenda feel free to come up what we're going to do to keep things healthy here have you go out that back door walk around come down this door here speak please right into the mic with these masks on it muffles everything so you got to get real close to it the other thing is there's a rule there's rules of conduct here in a nutshell treat people the way you want to be treated so basically rules of decorum say don't attack people and follow the rules and belong in a long time so do any citizens wish to be heard at this time sir yes thank you and if you'll state your name and address for the record my name is matt mcvalley i'm here on uh of the client of ours that has a piece of property under contract and through the due diligence phases of this design we come across a zoning ordinance that seems to be in conflict our client likes to do we just would like to request consideration for a change to that zoning ordinance so essentially what they're trying to do is looking to design and build a contemporary residential structure that's got a very flat type of roof profile system to it and with doing that they would like to have two levels of living and then a rooftop type of observation gap on top and per your zoning orbit section 94-209 there's a line event that stipulates two habitable stories being constructed alongside a garage for storage and then there's also another line within that paragraph that's excuse me can you can so again i'll just repeat that section so in section 94 209 there's a line in that paragraph that talks about two habitable stories may be constructed alongside sided garage or storage area or a button across your storage area and then there's a further sentence in that same paragraph that speaks to a maximum height of 35 feet from our structure that maximum height type of stipulation is something that we deal with in virtually every jurisdiction that we build in but the point that our client would like to discuss is the line that stipulates the two habitable stories so you know our thought with this is we can easily design a two plus story home and still stay within that maximum height stipulation of 35 feet and so i'd really like to just kind of question why that two-story reference is in there and maybe make a request to actually strike out a two-story reference let me just clarify before i because we normally don't have a back and forth here but i think so that we know what to do with this are you asking the city council to change the ordinance are you going to ask for a variance i would like you to change the order so we have discussed this in the previous weeks with your city manager and with one of the engineers and their response to us is there was no real forum to actually make this request other than submitting for a permit and then having it either approved or rejected as it is that causes our client a lot of you know horning with having some less than certain outcome at least within a general guideline of what could be built there and that one particular component of his design programming is very very valuable to him and if you cannot do it you would probably take his business last week and so he just doesn't want to commit you know a substantial sum of money to something that they have no ability to actually be built delighted intensive tv so i'm not sure what our next step of action could be for this mayor yes it was time okay thank you so the time's up i'm gonna just if i have council's permission i just want to give him the direction that we would be able to go is everybody all right with that where what would happen we can't do this tonight this is something that would have to go first to our work session which we're not going to have another work session until january or of course your other option or both is to seek a variance which with the board of adjustment but this can be brought up um at the work session for our discussion if there's and that's where we can talk freely under the florida rules we're not allowed to speak to each other off but we're not here so we have look we have a work session after this we can bring something up on a work session and then if there's if there's enough council members that are interested it will move forward and then the next step would be to actually put an ordinance out and that would happen the next month so that would be the procedure if you want to do it um i you know i don't mind bringing it up in a work session or ask that to be put on our next work session i don't think we have an issue i'm not sure that i'm understanding but i don't think there's an issue i'd like to hear from lynn why we think there's an issue the city engineer they came to us with some concepts and what we told what the city engineer looked had a consult with them and explain what our our code says and i've had a couple emails with them and i've told them you you can submit this and if it's denied you can apply for appearance that answer over and over and over that i've got emails back and forth from this group that they don't like that answer so uh i'm not i don't understand why it would potentially be denied they're proposing two story and staying underneath the 35 foot height it's well larry larry's in interpretation of the code and he's the one that would review this and you know my suggestion to him last week was bring it in if it if it's denied then submit for a variance you know their solution has been over and over and over well we want to apply for a code change and i said well we have a code review committee coming in january which is the plan right now and they can look at that but you know they haven't submitted us anything they've just brought a bunch of concepts and until that happens well it's really it's probably a 75 thousand dollar venture to bring you something to get it to knock well it's not cheap so there's got to be a solution in between can larry and you and i sit down with them and try to come up with something that's reasonable i mean that falls within our code well you know larry has looked at it and he's given his comments and we you know i can have larry come in again and we'll have a discussion about that but i'm just basing it on what our engineers say but what i'm hearing is he's asking actually for us as council members to change the law he has the right to do that i mean we can right i like council shirley's suggestion if you're willing to volunteer your time i mean if you can meet then you can move it to the next uh council center to the next work session it's not going to be till mid-january probably so if you feel that there's merit to changing that rule i mean you feel his merit or not just to get a discussion and then we can just you know decide yay or nay and then he has whatever option he has after that i mean if we're going to change it he may not have to do anything i think that's the right oh um i'm looking at section 94-209 and the last sentence of that provision reads experiences to the provisions of this section shall not be requested or granted so that's what the rule says in the code so he's actually trying to change the code right so you know they were told that there's a code review committee which tonight hopefully the charter will be approved and we'll move forward with that and and i also told them if they want to come in to a council meeting they could do that what's your timeline uh he has a hard closing date like the first week of january on this piece of property and he's just very um you know he's a little tented about committing millions of dollars to piece of property that he may not be able to actually build what he wants where he knows we can build that same property elsewhere and we built that type of structure all around the capitol bay region so it's really just this one small word of two available stories of what we're questioning there you can move it to a work session we do not have to wait for a code change i mean that'll be june by time that rolls around so it's good well you're still gonna have to do a code change so that's going to be okay if we do a work session then we change the code that's still april i just have an issue because i see this all over the city where structures are 35 feet and then there's a roof deck above that i have a question what's what street is the property on it's on power drive and there's another structure just like she's talking about where that exact same example is already there yeah so i'll i'll get larry to come in and we'll set something up jody are you it out with the city manager and um and council but maturely to have an appointment and then we can the best we can do and i'm not promising you that it would even make it out of the committee with the work session but the best we could do is get it out of work session into an ordinance it still has to pass first reading and second reading so this isn't an easy process but i mean it gives you an option at least um and of course you always have the option of going to the board of adjustment if you'd like so you could be doing both okay does the board of adjustments meet again that would be something that might be important uh if someone applies uh it's six weeks right approximately yes so you might want to apply just in case you can always cancel it okay and i just apply through the city city club it can be a board of adjustment override the caveat that's in that section you just referred to for i don't know how right yeah i'm not sure it's uh something that i've noticed also about code is is there's different sets of code for different sections of town not everything's the same on every street so your neighbor a couple of streets over may have something that you can't have on that particular street well the portion i'm reading from is it's based on the zoning classification and that that's you have different standards for different zoning classifications there there are some i'll read this another sentence from the code provision that says permitted exceptions to the height regulations set forth in this section are chimneys uh coppolas and similar declarations provided no height extension i.e coppola shall be used as as a habitable habitable space and provided no plumbing or electric service shall be allowed after the 35 foot height restriction i don't know with what you're talking about if what exactly exceeds the height restriction but the code provision allows for some ability to to go beyond it what we're requesting nothing would exceed the height restriction all we would exceed is the mention of the two committable stories so using flat profile rules that you see more i'm having trouble hearing them said we're not closing anything that would would exceed the height max what we're proposing is something that would exceed the two habitable stories stipulation so we're basically looking to go like two plus stories two and a half stories well so it's all in the definition of having those stories i mean an observation fact isn't i don't in my mind isn't going to have them in space nobody's living up there or right for the florida building it's not a habitable space as well so there may be more discussion here yeah i don't see changing the ordinance as a time effective half meter i don't the variance thing is kind of questionable right now so i'm thinking you need to have a meeting of the minds here and a concurrence of what's a habitable space and what's not because just that first collection i just don't see an observation or a walk path on the roof isn't it council we're not going to resolve this tonight but we're not going to give you any binding advice okay anything we've told you is just a shooting from the hip no promise on behalf of the city so here's the option speak with the city manager councilwoman shirley subject to her availability she has an extensive experience in building so she can sit down and go over this she can bring your motion to the uh or bring the motion to the next work session i agree with vice mayor this is a time you know making legislation is even in a little city takes a while um so that's an option to you have the board of adjustment as an option and of course then you have to make the decision that's best so um you know by all means take what you think is best to do um we're here for you if you have a problem and you run into a stone wall give me a call and i will move it on to the work session for you but you're gonna have to be here i'm not advocating for or against it you're just going to put it on there then you can make a presentation to us briefly and then you know and maybe inform us a little bit better of what you're looking for it is possible to change law but it's you know quite easy okay okay appreciate your time thank you any other citizens wish to be heard at this time there being no other citizen comments then i'm going to close them at this point we have the presentation by the pinellas county sheriff's office sheriff good evening i'm sergeant-favorite palace county sheriff's office um assuming at this point you guys all have the october report in front of you very quickly in november i looked at the cad history and does not appear to be any major crimes in the city in the month of november we'll get a report out to as soon as we can for the month of october um if you look at page one there were no ucr crimes in the city and our overall crimes for the year are still way down from previous year that's good news on page two uh there was uh three charges this month they all stand for one arrest is a self-initiated activity by the deputies on a dui stop that traffic stop that resulted in three different charges for drug possession and for ddy moving on to page three uh you'll notice the majority of the activity that deputies had in the city this month was self-initiated related to the traffic and parking concerns the city has mentioned in the past uh including 174 direct patrols 166 traffic stops and 61 illegally or been parked or abandoned vehicles on page four you'll see there's only one crash in the city this month which is a very good always a good thing to see and there were 177 citations and warning issues any members have any questions relating to reports i don't have any questions but i would like to make a comment i am absolutely amazed at how great of a job you guys do so i just wanted to let you know i am so impressed and i am glad that you're there for us thank you thank you ma'am it's always appreciated are you going to be at the uh work session yes sir i'll be staying in the entire will be representing the sheriff's department i will be here for security purposes sir i will be uh making examples might have to share this i'll make my comment now okay okay i normally am very impressed with the sheriff and quite frankly this um this crime prevention is excellent but when i make multiple calls myself and people in my household the people around me make multiple calls to report law breaking in our city an ongoing problem that's been going for 115 days and the sheriff drives by it and then the sheriff tells me personally that they're not going to enforce the law i've got a problem with that yes sir because the contract says you shall enforce our law and enforcing the law isn't driving by in my opinion so what i would like you to tell everybody here is if you can what other laws do you plan on not enforcing since you're not enforcing the noise over things sir i'm not sure exactly what you're referring to and i'll have a full briefing i've worked one shift um out here um you know for some here for the quarter of the year uh so i'm not sure exactly what you're referring to i know uh um vaguely regarding uh i guess the day shift issue you're having regarding a noise issue uh quarantine uh i'm not you know well briefed on that at this time so i can't make any comments directly on that but uh any um as far as i know any laws that are on the books regarding florida state statutes we will be enforcing okay any other questions or um uh counsel yeah you know we keep saying that we the sheriff's office shall enforce those things but we seem to leave out the second half of that thing which says they have discretionary powers for that enforcement thing so i mean i put my faith and confidence in these guys to do their job to the best of their abilities and there are a lot of demands on their time and resources and i think i i have faith and trust and confidence and their ability to discern where they need to employ their resources and best utilize their time thank you anything else to do for you at home be careful out there any other council comments i'm going to open up to the citizens any citizen like to comment now what we're going to do because we have a safety concern here um because we can't both share the microphone so normally we ask you to come up and speak at the microphone so sure if someone wishes to speak would you just step aside briefly and then you come back and you can answer okay absolutely would anyone like to speak uh are any questions or comments for the sheriff miss van scott you speak right into the microphone okay all right can you tell me should you hear me first everybody yeah but it wouldn't be bad if you got a little closer to it okay is that better yep okay jim van scoyne 7th street bella beach i got a copy of a statement here from the citizen who's partaking in the uh protesting on the corner of sixth street in south boulevard and i'm going to read it mayor bella beach filming us while we peacefully weigh flags on golf boulevard he also harassed us by sending two deputies to our house to threaten us with fines if we don't remove our political sites which are perfectly legal can't figure out what his problem is this council excuse me what does this have to do with the sheriff's report because that's what we're talking about is the sheriff's report not that's for the next meeting i don't think she's gotten to her point so please continue okay so i've made numerous reports on safety issues okay cars running the crosswalk at sixth street in golf boulevard and so my question to the sheriff's department is what can we do about this yes there is protesters out there and yes it is a distraction from the drivers and i actually saw someone run the light and i kind of think it was because of the distraction i can't say for sure but i i kind of think it was because of the distraction from the people out there with the signs okay there was somebody crossing the crosswalk at the time okay so it's becoming a big safety issue when we when we have a distraction going on by the one crosswalk which we address this city address with pinellas county in the last work session about creating even another crosswalk on that end of town for for our citizens so my question is what can we do to fix that problem and my other thing it is is the last time i checked this council said they voted on that the only one that's allowed to direct the sheriff is the city manager the mayor has never directed the sheriff and that's what i want to get across and get on this camera never directed this shirt he never made a call those deputies after speaking to them okay when i spoke to one of the deputies they actually got reports made on them and they didn't go over there they went over there to try to settle this this issue they never said anything about these people's signs never said a word about these people's signs these are lies if we listen to what the sheriff has seen support the blue we absolutely support the blue but you don't fall follow two police reports against two different officers and say you're just supporting the police i have law enforcement in my family who does this and then posts it on social media if you're not trying to get a point of order that's i don't believe there's any rebuttal needed if there is a traffic issue that's occurring um now that's been brought to my attention i'll pass information from to captain liner so you can make sure that the dayship deputies are aware of that traffic concern and uh and they can address that appropriately as as they see fit um like i said i'm on six pm to six a.m i'm not seeing those during my hours but uh i will you know bring that to captain miner and uh you know let him know that there was a citizen concern regarding cars not stopping the gulf uh sixth street um crosswalk and uh he can address that let's issue if there's not swishes to be heard anyone else for the sheriff there being no other citizen comments then i'll close it sheriff thank you so thank you appreciate it item four is a presentation for the florida league of cities um administrator of the florida municipal insurance trust the city of bel air beach in recognition of outstanding achievements in safety excellence and its recognition of the safety excellent uh excellence initiative so we have a safety excellence initiative here mr reeves did you want to just give us a quick background what this is all about i know you're more familiar than i am it's a program that florida municipal trust put together kyle stepped up at patty they did the survey the individual came in and did a survey of our properties and we scored 90 something on the thing i don't remember the exact but also we were the first city in florida to achieve that [Applause] patty that put the application together submitted it and then an individual came out and did the inspection very well so we have a plaque over here now normally we'd all get together and shake hands and do everything we're going to try and do this as keeping as much social distance as possible but kyle i know you're here for petty gentry if you come over here will yeah take a picture okay so um i want patty gentry our city clerk and kyle riefler our is it city administrator is it what's the community services community services administrator to accept this plaque from the florida league of cities first to the state to do this congratulations folks hey all right item five is the quarterly board reports do we have anyone here from any of the boards yes uh [Music] sorry hi everyone good evening um my name is tiandi lavenda and i am the new chair of the park and rec board um i just have a really quick report because we are only having our third meeting this wednesday but just a couple things that we're working on um i'm happy to say that we have a full team of seven people and it's a really good group so i'm excited to be working with them moving forward for the next couple years um we are working on the 2021 calendar we're looking at increasing some activities for our community to participate in and some special events for the first quarter we're going to try to keep everything as compliant as possible so we don't end up like booking things and having to cancel them um we're currently working on some surveys of our 13 parks they're looking pretty good but otherwise that's really all i have right now and hopefully i'll have more for you at the next meeting see if anyone has any questions for you okay council is there any questions i've got a couple comments for you um welcome when you guys decide what kind of events that you want to present to us for approval are you guys looking at asking the community what they want in order to get their feedback as well yeah i would love to do that and i've talked to lynn a couple of times about like the surveys that people are putting out and i know the communication board is looking for ways that we can follow all the rules and still be able to ask people what they're interested in and what they want um so we're trying to right now to just encompass like a large list and try to fit things that you know like different groups of people would like and we're just going to narrow it down and if something works and people are interested in signing up for it great if it doesn't we'll just replace it with something else until we find like a core group of activities that um people are interested in but yes we would love to get a survey out or whatever asking people what they're interested in and one more quick comment um on these advanced that you're looking at are you keeping that just for the community or did you plan on opening them up to the public not just the community and we're going to start really small just because you know six months ago no one thought that we would still be like canceling events and like you know just because we don't know what it's going to look like we're going to keep the events at a minimum right now and keep them within the community and like i said as covet compliant as possible until we have more information and we know what it looks like moving forward council any questions or comments let me open it up to the citizens citizens any questions for the parks board chairman chairperson i'm sorry there being none um thank you very much and looking forward to a good new year okay thank you thank you do you have anyone from any of the other boards see no one else is completed so now we have a public hearing and this is item six it's consideration of ordinance 20-0-4 an ordinance granting to duke energy florida llc doing business as duke energy an electric utility rights-of-way utilization franchise prescribing the terms and conditions related to the occupancy of municipal streets and rights of way in the city of belarus florida for the purpose of providing electric service providing for severability of provisions and providing for an effective date this is the second reading of this ordinance and uh the description is that it's a rights of way utilization to provide electric service so first do i have a motion so surely makes the motion and a second second second is by david gavis um councilmember shirley this as i understand it's just a housekeeping item that needs to be um it's an extension of a right away it's already right away it's are there any other comments citizens any comments on this unfortunately we're not here [Music] i just have to make a comment to go two consecutive five year periods after the tenure automatically i really don't know just to experience sitting down with them at the table to discuss projects and this is mainly headed for you jody if you ever continue with the undergrounding um there's a lot of things that were left right and i'll just give one for instance the pedestals that were installed we had requested flat pedicles and at the end of the project one of our neighbors had that pedestal installed flat in front of his home and we tried to get it and for some reason i guess we didn't stick to our guns enough and we got all the higher pedestals and we could have got ground level pedestal so i really don't trust some of the uh work that they do that's all also any other comments so this is the second reading it will pass um councilmember beam you don't have any do you have any proposal to change at this point because that would take us back now first okay so it's going to go then the way it is all right so there'll be no other comments that i counsel i'm going to read it and call the question consideration of ordinance 20-0-4 an ordinance granting to duke energy florida llc doing business as duke energy an electric utility rights-of-way utilization franchise prescribing the terms and conditions related to the occupancy of municipal streets and rights-of-way in the city of bellar beach florida for the purpose of providing electric service providing for severability of provisions and providing for an effective date this is the second reading a yes vote will get this passed at this point madam clerk would you please call the role council member bean councilmember gattis aye council member shirley aye councilmember swope aye council member aki aye vice mayor gunn mayor manzo nay so it passes four to three um see uh manager i'll let you move forward then on this one i guess when i need my signature and then moving forward yes okay so that'll be done as soon as you can present it please there you go here the next uh item yes we need to delete that from because we gotta advertise it okay so because we called it as an agenda i mean it's gonna procedurally if no one moves it it will move forward i do have a question for you because i'm confused when we last spoke about this we were talking about doing it on december 21st for the meeting and then i see that we have a december 30th so i just want to make sure our dates are right because i did say december 21st last time to the public and i want to correct that publicly it is december 21st it is so what's in our packet here is incorrect then right okay no it was corrected it was corrected yeah i have a prior practice it could be yeah all right so this be this is ultimately going to probably be moved to the 21st which is what our original plan was it was put up here accidentally but let me do this the right way oh i don't want to read this whole thing listen every anyone on council want to move item seven once twice move it to be heard tonight i need a motion no money motioning okay so let's just have some questions items up i mean we have we have questions maybe tonight's the night to do it because the 21st is the second uh reading but no i'm not in favor of a second meeting tonight but i would like to highlight some questions i have and maybe people can think about it so we need to move it and discuss it and then close it and then not pass it i hate to do that can we um with the council permit and i don't want to get into a super long discussion but would we permit the vice mayor to at least get his concerns out here on the record so we could all hear it tonight and think about it and he was always dispensing with the procedure temporarily you want to post vice mayor before yeah my my questions deal with uh article 2 section 2.1 i think it is article 5 section 5.03 and it deals with eligibility and at the time we sat down to do these charter amendments i was in favor of it and after i read this again things are starting to come into focus for me and basically we've changed the uh being a registered board of miller beach for 12 months instead of six months i we didn't change the word regarding uh physically residing in the city for 12 months instead of in six months but what's starting to come into focus for me is we're using this who have physically resided in the city my question is what does that mean and what are the boundaries around that i mean we have a lot of people here who go on extended vacations with their kids or go visit family or go on go visit other places exotic places or have second homes and my question is what does it mean to physically reside here i understand being a resident of miller beach for a term of 12 months versus six but i think maybe that needs to be possibly uh a little specified some more and again it's the same thing in the other ones that must have uh must have been a registered voter and residing in the city for 12 months i'm just started putting it into focus that's it well glenn i mean if if they're homesteaded that would mean they are residents of the city i mean if they travel four months out they wouldn't be able to be a mayor or council member if they missed over so many meetings as we put on the other ordinance chains so i think they have to understand the way this is written then i think if you read the other parts in the charter it would make sense they read the whole list of requirements so i think we could leave this alone be honest with you as far as residents go full-time residents i don't necessarily agree with the homestead option i think that there are many people that live here now that rent all the time they vote they pay taxes and they participate and a homestead should not exempt them just because they happen to be a renter i think the whole purpose is i remember this like a year ago when we were on this charter review committee but it was to keep people who really it's not a problem if you take a six-month vacation as long as we're coming back to bella beach permanently if you don't live here and you happen to come down here for the winter you really shouldn't be on council that was i think the idea of the charter review committee you know you shouldn't be governing the city that you know if you're a resident of uh wyoming you know i accept that explanation and i think that was the intent at the time i'm just questioning whether or not it needs to be tightened up or if everybody accepts that or willing to live with it well i think b says you must remain a permanent resident of the city during the term of office so i think that kind of tightens it up there for me saying that yeah if you do take six months vacation it's awesome for you but if you want to be on the council you're not going to take those six months vacation as well on council yeah we tighten that up with the uh the uh attendance thing but you know this is in the qualifying and the eligibility portion not in the okay you're on council you know it's kind of like two different moving parts there so i'm certainly willing to go with the consensus here if that's that's the interpretation and the city attorney wanted to be heard i i was going to say that the charter provisions have to be read in the context of state law and state election law addresses those kind of those kind of standards about what what does a resident mean and what does an elector mean and those those things are defined in in those that area of florida statutes so i would would suggest to you that you you obviously don't want to have a charter provision that's in inconsistent with florida statute that would cause your problems i would tell you i don't think this one as it's written is inconsistent at all i think it dovetails with existing florida law which you have to comply with okay so we will have a second um we'll have a second reading on the 21st and if there's obviously that vice mayor if that satisfies you wonderful if not obviously we can debate it at that point if it doesn't get through second reading then back to the drawing board i think we have to start all over again with it um okay any other comments on well seven is finished it didn't get moved so let's move on to the consent agenda we have three items on the consent agenda the approval of the november 2nd 2020 city council meeting meeting minutes the approval of the november 16 2020 city council work session minutes and item 10 authorization to execute a purchase order with duke energy for a binding estimate to underground the electric facilities on east side of gulf boulevard and that is a purchase order in the amount of 10 281 do i have a motion to approve the entire consent agenda so move it surely makes the motion second second but more there's no discussion on this we go right to a vote i'll do it by voice all in favor of approving well let me read it again because i have to do that to make it official so the consent agenda we're approving the november 2nd 2020 city council meeting minutes approving the november 16 2020 city council work session minutes and authorization to execute a purchase order with duke energy for a binding estimate to underground the electric facilities on the east side of gulf boulevard yes vote passes this all in favor wait excuse me so you uh do we want to have public comment uh do we need it on consent agenda okay because we normally don't have discussion on it i don't know i'll open it public no there being no public comments i'll come back for a vote all in favor and the opposed pass is seven to zero move on to the regular agenda item 11. request from the park we have a request from the park and recreation board to cancel the 2020 events schedule and that is they're requesting that we cancel the 2020 events due to the copic 19 um pandemic do we have a motion beam i'll open it up robin no i mean 2020 is almost over and coveted is raging so i think this is a good idea to cancel the events any other comments open it to the citizens any back comments council with rabanaki having the last word okay so this is a request from the park and recreation board to cancel the 2020 events schedule and yes vote will cancel that schedule matter clerk council member shirley aye council member swope aye council member aki i council member beam i'm council member gathers vice mayor gunn mayor manzo so it passes seven to zero and the 2020 event schedule that we had previously approved is now cancelled item 12 consideration of resolution 2020-12 a resolution of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing for a schedule of slip rental fee changes for the bellaire beach marina and establishing an effective day this is the description on this is the marina slip rental feed changes first we have a motion moved by gaddis second anyone second second was joey robinaki i'm sorry hey guys uh yes i think this is uh something that we've been uh talking about for uh quite a bit of time uh as you know uh one of our citizens uh took this one and uh and ran with it and then we passed it off to parks and rec and uh and i think that we've got a pretty good plan here uh so i say uh we move forward with it i'm gonna second the support on this and the thanks for uh resident bill lusk can put a tremendous amount of work into this and also this comes out of the finance committee as i recall i think this started with them and through parks board it went through and bill lusk was kind of shepherding it through throughout this thing and we've discussed it so i think it was a good job of everyone working together on this so all in favor of it i'm definitely in favor anyone else on council i have a question i might be reading this wrong um on the first page at the bottom it says new licensee slip rental so this will be effective as of april the 10.15 but then effective april 1st 2023 it goes to 9 and 13. and then goes back up 2025 to 10 and 15. the proposal that was given was any new slip owner would pay the new fee because the new fee technically would be the excuse me the 10 and 15 but the existing slip owners theirs will be gradually increased so they don't get culture shock immediately okay so the new ones will stay at 10 and 15 until the existing ones catch up okay i just threw it i read it wrong just making sure thank you that's what we had discussed was easy getting it for everyone right particularly for the people who've been there a long time any other council comments i'll open up to the citizens any citizen comments i'll bring it back to the council with dave gaddis getting the last word okay okay all right so before us now is consideration of resolution 20 2019 it's a resolution of the city council of the city of valor beach florida providing for a schedule of slip rental fee changes for the bellar beach marina and establishing an effective day the yes vote will pass this clerk council member swept aye council member aki i'm councilmember bean aye councilmember gattis all right council member shirley aye vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so pass the seven to zero to the management city clerk please implement yeah it just a reminder it's not effective resolution 2020-1 a resolution of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing for the city clerk with authority to transmit adopted charter amendments to munico and the florida department of state and establishing an effective date this is council's approval to have amendments incorporated into the charter we have a motion clearly makes the motion executed by more beam over to jody shirley again just housekeeping this needs to be done to finalize those uh amendments that we johnny could you speak i said again it's just housekeeping to make those amendments official that we're voted on that's it this is the the voters overwhelmingly passed these this is what we have to do to make them into the code and into the charter so correct any other council comments open it up to the citizens there being no citizen comments i'll come back to council with joey shirley getting the last word for a vote reporting from the call okay so this is consideration of resolution 2020-20 a resolution of the city council of the city of bellar beach florida providing the city clerk with the authority to transmit adopted charter amendments to munico and the florida department of state and establishing an effective date madam clerk council member aki aye councilmember beam aye councilmember gattis aye councilmember shirley aye councilmember swoe aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo all right so passes seven to zero now i'm please transmit these i'm going to ask you a question do you know how long it will take once you've defected the trans people how long it takes them to actually change our charter officially the process at approximately two months by the time it goes through the entire process of codifying verifying and that's just an approximate you'll let us know when it officially you'll get some notification when that happens yes i can even let you know during each i would like to just track the progress because people with state agencies these things could get lost or something i just you know we want to move this thing through okay thank you all right move to item 14 which is the city council approval of the charter for the planning and zoning board review of city codes the description is the council approval of the proposed charter first do we have a motion second well i think we passed this out enough glenn did a great job on putting this together with the city manager and let's move forward counsel any other comments citizens any comments back to council mark you have the last word passion right okay all right so number 14 we're calling the question city council approval of the charter of the planning and zoning board for the review of the city codes yes vote passes it madam clerk council member gaddis i'm councilmember bean aye councilmember aki aye councilmember shirley aye councilmember swope aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo aye so it passes seven to zero it's passed and uh city manager you'll ask them and letting them know that you've passed this right now have a discussion try to set up a [Music] meeting okay item 15 consideration of a draft for a standing advisory committee concept it was proposed by vice mayor gunn the description is city council approval developed to develop a standing advisory committee for the continuity and expediency and that's it for continuity and expediency okay i started um you have motion so moved shall we surely second yeah i think this is a great idea um on glenn's part we um from time to time have a need to have an advisory committee such as the finance committee parks planning that sort of thing and it's nice to have a group of people that are kind of have their hand on the pulse of what's going on in the city that can help us on special projects i'll just wait in a little bit i mean obviously uh everything's pretty much spelled out in the document draft itself but uh one thing that's not addressed there is the the how we get the multiply and effect for the city staff i mean the staff has spread kind of thin and when we come up with projects and stuff like this you know we struggle to try to find people so this gives us an extra resource to depend on their scanning we don't have to take the time to advertise it to put together voting and put together the committee they're up and running they're familiar with the budgets they're familiar with the codes so there's some continuity and experience involved in that the other thing we're finding is it's it gives us a source for more resident engagement and we're finding out that some of these other committees we've gotten a lot of benefits from that people when the residents get get a say in these committees they stand behind it and they obviously take that information back into the community and can't act as disciples for for some of this information and it just gives us some extra divergent thinking on some of this stuff we don't get into a group think of with just a council and as people change out in the council it's going to provide more continuity thank you thanks man i have a question for you on the next the thing that says next year if conceptually feasible and then official then the city manager will begin the process of formalizing what did that mean well i i think it's actually just move it out of the draft stage and start building the actual skeleton for how we want to do this put put it into actual motion saying okay it's no longer a draft this is this is the plan for how we're going to do it and this is the timeline for incorporating that this is how we're going to advertise for people and this is how we if we need a resolution there's it's more to it than just just this draft of the concept yeah that's what was confusing me and i think and and we could defer to the city attorney on this one city attorney can you bring it into the open please tell us what you were discussing this is a sunshine meeting so please tell us what you were just discussing with the city manager yes tell us i was just asking fred if we could what we'd have to do to adopt an additional committee like we have the park board in the code and those things that's what i was answering and i was actually going to speak to that in my reading of this it has to be done by ordinance so i think that the next step would be for us to do an ordinance on this if we you know if we decide that we want to move forward on this this isn't really a resolution tonight but i mean we it's kind of almost a work system i don't mind moving it forward to the next step of an ordinance but i think ordinance is the right way to go on this thing yeah i'd have to go back and look at the actual references because it talks about our ordinance or our resolution is what i think it says so i mean we need to go back and what what's the best way to chisel daddy granted yeah mr mayor i was i was expecting it to be an ordinance so it's codified yes i have read it today i thought it was an ordinance and i think particularly if we're gonna and i i think the only other question i have this is three years is a long term that's a council member's term or vice mayor mayor's term it might i don't think we have any other committee that has that long at the time so that was you know if we're going to go that long we definitely want to qualify this thing and definitely do a via ordinance so um but if we want to move it forward we can take a vote on that might i'm going to defer to the city attorney though this isn't a resolution so can we take a res can we take a vote here just as a consensus to move us forward you could do a consensus my understanding is neither an ordinance or a resolution at this point it's a concept okay all right so counsel any other comments yes i would like to say something uh vice mayor linden you always always do some impressive work on various projects and thank you for undertaking this again i'm going to just let go joey councilwoman shirley she said everything i was going to say but thank you you just always go above and beyond and it's just impressive any other council comments open up to the citizens any comments on this back to council with jody shirley having the last word you know all i can say is when we had the finance committee they did a incredible job that group of individuals really were professional had a lot of experience behind them and that's what i envisioned this to be a group like that so i can support it moving forward so tonight what we're going to do is a consensus to move this forward the city manager will um continue uh glenn van impe i think most of everything in here is is going to be workable so you'll work with him to refine it we have to get it to an ordinance i believe you can double check it but when i read it this morning it said ordinance um let's get into an ordinance and then we can do our double reading and this thing should be able to be through by uh hopefully back to everywhere okay so yes so let me call this question so this is a consensus to move forward to considerate the draft that has been provided by vice mayor gunn for the standing advisory committee concept yes vote will move it forward adam clerk council member beam council member gaddis council member shirley aye councilmember slobe aye councilmember aki vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo all right so passes seven to zero we'll move it forward and if you can i mean i know it's the holidays if you can get it for january that's wonderful if not it'll appear on the first chance we can for an ordinance unfinished business city manager i think you had one in the um in a minute so that you were going to [Music] be working on some proposals for us for the supplemental police patrols in the city yes uh i got the pricing and everything but what i need from the console is how much do you anticipate you want to how often do you want to do it and what kind of money do you want to fund it with as an example that's what i asked last month so hopefully you can kind of give me some guidance on that because we'll have to do a budget amendment contract simple we won't ever announce when it's happening so we can move this forward but i need to know what the conscious thought is as i recall we were talking quarterly and i think that was at best you know depending on the cost and the success it's not a commitment i think we do one by one as we use them but that's what i remember i don't know if anybody else had a different idea yeah i was going to say we don't have a budget so that's you know clearly hard to say what we're going to spend on it without taking a hard look at those finances and you know where we have excess i think we originally talked about like zeroing in on holidays and you know busy times like that i think that that was kind of a the no-brainer like let's say okay yeah these days are going to be new year's eves coming up that's probably a good time to have extra patrol on duty you know things that are obvious like that to begin with and see where we go from there that's what i recall and we were talking about holidays we're talking about every you know when people people start pouring back in here in january weekends and of course it's hard to tell when you're gonna have when you have a week like this when is the weather gonna be nice that you know everyone's gonna hit the beach on saturday you know that's so maybe a weekend here and there and uh holidays would be our i think our main focus that's what i would propose thanks man can i make a suggestion i will work with the city manager and maybe come up with a requirements base rather than just saying we want to throw x number of dollars at this thing and maybe we've got money burning a hole in our pocket let's figure out what holidays how many hours and come back to you and say okay here's option day we need so many million hours at this cost we can cover these holidays these periods let us come up with some options rather than just try to shop my only concern i love it but can we get a proposal for january because if we're going to study this and study it we're going to miss this season and we're gonna have some stuff like we had last year i i will tell you i've talked to the sheriff about doing something uh during the holidays okay i'm not gonna tell you what day because so i've talked to him about that but you know why i know councilman began if i were ever like you said something like three thousand dollars a quarter or something and i may be wrong with that number but it was just a thought process to start off with i can go ahead and do that i'll just move some money out of the code enforcement budget because there's a but going forward you know we talked about of course the summer holidays uh the eastern time frame eastern parade you know the fourth of july things of that nature and some other weekends that are scattered the problem really isn't i wouldn't say it's a weekday problem it's a weekend problem and focus on areas as an example what we found in the studies was speed off the bridge the red light here turning and rolling somebody put a sign up there last week just to let you know somebody drew aside and put it on there don't stop so so you know [Music] those are what we're going to go after initially crosswalks occasionally but i think it focuses this area here because that was the biggest problem so so we're actually talking even before january we're talking about this holiday season so pitch a dollar in value at an hour and uh to do it effectively it's whatever hours we use you're gonna end up with you need two people you need a spotter and you need another deputy because you're not going to gain much here you might be able to gain much with using whatever but when you're talking about rolling through the stop sign or right in the crosswalk or things of that nature you've got to have a spotter so depending how many hours we do it it's probably going to cost us let's say we did it a couple days during christmas holidays new year's holiday whatever and it's uh three or four hours so that's double that that's uh about 500 per i think it was uh uh basically what it what the what it would have been the amount of charges would have been uh that was free but uh whenever they showed us what the total would have been we certainly didn't want to spend that much right but uh i think that after we looked it over that about one quarter of that and then we pick and choose effective dates and times uh would be the best utilization of those resources okay so we'll we'll put something together with beyond the new year but we will do something uh sooner maybe sooner we're not going to tell you let us know um how it goes when it goes i'm sure we'll hear about it my phone will start ringing okay okay any other unfinished business have a closet city attorney nothing this evening city manager uh just to give you some quick updates seventh and eighth street project is underway if you haven't been on those streets the people that live on them there's pipe everywhere tomorrow they're going to do some milling we're going to meet in the morning because we're going to look at those areas like at the beginning of the street we're going to mill that area and try to retake it out with the hurricane the beach boardwalks the four accesses that pinellas county gave us fifty thousand dollars toward that's underway everything's been pulled out they're starting to put the pilings in for the new walkovers undergrounding on the west side of gulf boulevard is cabling they're doing that and i know you've seen a lot of trucks we've got duke here and spectrum and we're working that forward right now i was told uh friday the schedule for the 22nd street shoot is the 16th and that should be a one-day shoot of you know it's just one one run so they shouldn't have a big trouble with that the tennis courts uh were supposed to start this week but they're delayed a few days so but that will start uh communications committee we sent that the survey out by constant contact the old list patti's been getting another date of the females today we've got 104 back and it's good that we ask for them to give us their address because that way we can verify that they actually are residents because we've gotten a couple back that we don't even have that street here so we're looking to build a resident uh uh database so um and then after this we'll mail after the first year to the rest of the residents so as of last friday we had 82 uh because we ran a little study to see how many of the previous lists we got back we got 82 of them and we got another 25 of the others so we're picking up a few uh i left it your you just got this man i left at your place tonight pictures of the redeveloped sign those concepts that we talked about the hybrid which is the second page or the electronic which is the first page for you to look at so if you've got any comments on that please send them to me so i can get this resolved and we can move forward with what we're going to do we got notified also our finance people they got their government finance association certificate of achievement we got notified today and that's congrats to heather and uh andy they've done a real good job for us you know and very cost effective so uh that worked out real well actually yeah it's turned out well uh we're going through the audit now the auditor is going to be here next thursday and friday for a couple days with them and it's worked out very well i also left you the total report for last month it looks like a lot of stuff on there one of the items sections on there is because of people's trees were overhanging the road in the fire department so it looks like a lot of a lot of activity and really it was focused to keep tree limbs and stuff so the fire trucks wouldn't hit them and then we did start on the boat tour that i take i've taken with dave and laura took with jody and we started notifying the homeowners of the issues there so we we started that process so and uh that's it did you hear back from dvp yes i did talk to the ep uh i talked to the local person she told me that mr mark martinello would be contacting me eventually she kind of led me to believe that there's a discrepancy in what the statute says and what they say so that's got to be resolved because pinellas county says that property is considered public and her interpretation is a little bit different but she said she has nothing to do with it she's just the picture taker and sent it forward she did tell me that they might have us plant something at 19th street but that's pretty much what she told me and they are growing back it's so we'll resolve that when it gets to when mr martinel she said it maybe two or three months before they get back to us why did you speak to them ah when did you speak to them uh i'd have to look at my computer i sent emails i called them left messages and it was not a uh how do you call it it took several messages and phone calls to even get a response but that's typical but then i think it was over two weeks ago because i was at the beach excuse me and the they started growing back i mean everything was pretty green and four inches high when i was there a couple weeks ago so yeah 19th street there's a problem on the north side has nothing to do with what our city did so that's resident induced so if there's additional planting being done it's a resident on mellow shore that's killing those not the city so i made about 10 calls to them to try and get an update for tonight because i remember they said there was like 100 calls from citizens so i said we have a council meeting it took like 10 calls so that part is correct they told me something quite a bit different than what you heard um and i did speak to mr martinelle so as of friday and this could change as of tomorrow for i know but they said they're going to issue a report sometime this week don't hold your breath but supposedly this week the good news is that they're not going to find us the bad news is that we didn't violate the law the a permit was required to cut that stuff down and they would never give a permit to cut it to the levels that it was um the good thing is is that you're correct it's grown back and they seem to say instead of having to do the replanting that they're just going to let it grow back and monitor it with us they're going to do what's called an outreach and that outreach will basically just be a stern warning to us to never do this again make sure we get it permitted in the future and as long as we do that there won't be any fines or penalties or anything like that and then they're going to monitor it to make sure it grows back properly much like councilwoman shirley i've been looking at the sixth street one it is starting to grow back um so it will be back i'm sure but i don't think well i don't think i know you're never gonna get to do this again um you're gonna have to get a permit from them and usually a permit will let you cut it from like eight feet to six feet i've read all 65 pages of this rule so um you don't you don't get to cut it down to the level that it was cut to um but that we lucked out this time um that's what they told me when we get the report um you're going to get a copy it's going right to the city hall here so you should get a copy of it um and they're going to give me a copy so um we'll see where it goes from there but uh luckily they're not going to force us to replant that because that's going to be that would be pretty expensive and what's the status of the police complaint that was filed against you and your public work staff well i i've asked for a copy of that but i haven't received it i was told that when they close it they will forward it to you so there's still a police complaint that's open against right and i don't really know what the police report says but i know there was a complaint filed and then i i assume just moving forward we'll have a protocol of some sort you'll have some something in a manual that tells staff how to handle any trimming along the beach that sort of thing it's a learning lesson and you know i think in the future if any of us encounter this again the first call to make would be to the city and not the police and not the dep and try to come up with a solution in the city rather than involving outside agencies that's a lesson i learned i'm going to agree with councilmember shirley on that i mean that's the way to go i mean somebody obviously made a mistake it didn't need to go to the level it went to it's going to grow back it's going to be fixed so i mean we just need to move on as a city this is insane dep so you know folks received over 100 complaints they had so many that they asked me to ask the citizens to stop complaining so this was a serious issue and as i said to mr martinello if this were two guys you know drinking some budweiser and ripping out these things they'd be on the front page of the temp at times and being arrested so this is serious and as long as i'm living here i don't want to ever see this happen again it's that simple so i hope it doesn't any other comments or questions for the city manager i i have a comment about the last topic which is uh i understand people make mistakes and this could have happened to anyone that did not know what they were doing and as long as we have some sort of a a training program some type of documentation i'm sure won't happen again just a hard lesson all it is and i know that the tone sounds awful but i i don't feel the same way and and i think that whoever did it needs a pass and they just need a a nice talking to and better training any other comments city club no nothing that was nothing right you're not by the bodies i'm just three people no comments right correct nothing yes okay city council comments of the month we start with rabinaki [Music] no i'm gone no i have only a month wait i'm missing someone tell me surely i'm sorry i went out of order well that's okay um i just want to tell everyone how merry christmas happy holidays i hope you know everyone enjoys their time with their family and i want to thank the city staff city manager for everything you guys do and you know i'm trying to get together a opportunity to support our police department by having a luncheon and a something to recognize them here at city hall and poland and i are working on some dates and we'll try to pass that along if anyone wants to join us for that that's it merry christmas that's great thank you um i'm sorry i went out to work you didn't have you got comments okay i have uh two comments from the big c um we had a big c meeting a couple weeks ago there were two issues one the big c has asked all the mayors to write a letter uh i think it's to the state if i'm not mistaken it could be to the to the um to the feds they have a problem i wish we had this problem they have too much sand and the sand is building up in john's past and it's starting to restrict boat travel it's starting to restrict the the marine mammals coming through so they want to try and get that stuff dredged and they're looking for all the support they can i have no problem in writing this letter if i have the time to do it i just before i committed um you know my efforts to it i want to make sure that the council is supportive of it if they want it i'll try and put something together i'm not guaranteeing i'm gonna get it done but i think i will be able to everybody have a problem with me writing that letter that would go on city letterhead mystery so if i get it done i think it's two letters they want one to the one to the mayor you know i'm saying that we support him and then one to the county i think it is for the state to do so i'll try and get that done so can i ask a question are they hoping to have the same relocated back out to the beach back up to probably florida beach where it came from i don't know if they need it they actually have i guess they have the shoals or whatever so they don't have sand um they don't need renourishment so i don't know what they're going to do with the sand but i guess i mean they have congressman crist and everyone else involved in this thing because it's not that easy i guess to get people to move the sand down but every mayor said we'll take it you know but um it's it's not that easy so that's what they're trying to do it's not a gimmick yeah that seems i mean that's pretty natural right with the sand moves and i know clearwater pass is having some issues too not nearly as bad but if you drive over you'll see there's a filling in of a new beach on the north east side of the pass there so their mayor strongly endorses you know the shoals that they have because that is actually they're collecting sand as opposed to losing it which is problems that most of the beaches have and the second topic is actually on beach renourishment i'm just going to pass on what i know i don't have there's people who are doing this full time so bellar beach congratulations we had 100 return of all of our beat easements that needed to be done but before we celebrate okay we had it i believe clearwater had it sam key but they were going pretty well in indian rocks and then a citizen wrote a letter to all the citizens scaring them and giving a lot of information some correct some not correct according to the mayor i've not seen this information not only has stuff stopped it has that people have actually said we want to take our approvals back so what i was told and i would convey it exactly as i was told it is not a gimme people are walking around saying they're going to do it anyway if you don't get 100 the answer was no or not they said that it doesn't matter whether you get the easements yes it does and that's what every that's what everyone has said that basically the whole project is in danger if they don't get the 100 percent compliance to make matters worse if the project gets pushed off if we don't become eligible again until 2030. so take good care of the sand out there because you may not get any more of it until 2030. there's nothing we can do about it unless you know folks who live in those areas tell them to sign the easements but the mayor's going to try and reach out i know their council is trying to reach out they're going to have education forms but this whole thing is in danger at this point in time okay so um it's approved at least we the beller beach has done everything you can do so talk to your friends and you know south of here and see if we can't get them to get this thing done because they basically reserve the right not to do any of it if they don't get those all those labor diseases that's all i had other than i wanted to prepare just to let you know uh yes we got all of our easements and so did clearwater and they are sending a letter uh to the corps of engineers that the county is doing this on our behalf to try to get them to at least consider the sections that they've got 100 south of us they're for the most part they're less than fifty percent uh yeah we worked with the county to get those easements and it worked out okay so if they will not do if they won't give us that variance of doing a small section then do we still have to provide parking well we have to provide it for 10 years from the time of the last so that would be i think i looked into that it was like 2028 or something that's that's part of the requirement so it was a couple of years ago that we got the re-nourishment right two or three years ago they need to double-check that i mean if that i mean if they're gonna pull back the continued renourishment i'm sure there's some claws in there that we don't have to continue providing parking and i'm i would be i would propose let's pull the bargain yes we got we got about six months out of that sand we had a storm right after that was worth giving our beach away for him we did our due diligence we hope that we're going south to it it's going to be a hard sell this apparently was a pretty good letter and it's um it apparently has some merit to it again i take no legal position i haven't seen the letter but it was a problem so um before we leave i want to give two pieces of well first i want to wish everybody a happy holidays and you know there's some special counsel meetings but these are quick things um monday november 21st will be that second reading of those december december twenties uh sorry december 21st yep um and that's at six pm that will last all about five minutes and uh something that everyone should be aware of is that the city council election qualifying begins friday december 11 at 8 a.m and it ends friday december 18th at 12 noon if you want to be on city council you have to speak with our city clerk she's also our director of elections she will get you set up with what you need to do to qualify it's nice to talk on social media it's nice to talk to your friends but if you want to make a difference you got to get on council so this is your opportunity for anyone in the city so i invite everyone to partake in that okay other than that do we have a motion to adjourn a second and um"
