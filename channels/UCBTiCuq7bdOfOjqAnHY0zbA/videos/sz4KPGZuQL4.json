is presenting tonight please come up and give us your name and uh let's have sure good evening Council my name is Bol with the pronoun County Sheriff's Office uh and this evening I'm going to present the November 2023 monthly analysis uh for crime statistics that occurred in the city of b beach uh and actually I'm pleased to report um this is a very good report for this month and uh if you look at the report there's actually only one motor vehicle theft uh there's no violent crimes no murderers sex offenses or robberies that have occurred and only one motor vehicle theft that occurred in November interestingly to note for that case uh the vehicle was actually recovered uh and uh the person that had lost that vehicle or that was stolen from had lent it to another friend and it was recovered all right there were three people that were arrested on several different charges uh through the month of November uh two of which were DUIs uh and then a companying controlled substance offenses and drug paraphernalia offenses um none of those were result of the crash the vast majority of our events that occurred in November there's 485 events and where 581 units responded to those events and the vast majority of those were direct patrols traffic stops or house checks a lot of our folks from out of town have returned so our house check numbers will probably drop over the next several months and then finally we only have had one crash in the city uh it is actually a single vehicle crash versus a pole a Duke Energy pole not a city owned property uh and there was no injuries in that crash and that's all I have to report does anybody have any questions thank you very much um I'm glad that we had an abbreviated report uh this time because we have no report in our attend I'm not sure what happened to it but we were we were trying to listen closely and it didn't sound like we had a whole lot U that was important but Council any questions no no thank you all right thank you so much you're welcome all right now we're on to the monthly code enforcement report which is included in our agenda Deputy Trump you have the floor and uh has everybody met Deputy yet I do not believe so um just let you all know I am Deputy Richard Trump with B SK sheriff's office I have just a brief history I have just taken over for your code enforcement from uh Steve clet uh who is sitting behind me and giving me support tonight um just a brief history is I've been with the N countyy Sheriff's Office 4 I'm in my 39th year now I retired after 37 years came back immediately doing uh various tasks for him helping with training and everything as a reserve and I got a call asking if I'd be doing this and I jumped at the opportunity so I appreciate um you all working with me and uh while I'm learning here some new tasks and and very excited to do so uh as far as your monthly code enforcement report basically we had 38 for I'm sorry for the month of December we had basically 38 calls for service uh for code enforcement uh with those we uh basically had 29.7 3% was dealing with unpermitted remodels uh we had 18.92% construction related nuisances uh other vehicle and traffic which may be our own traffic stops cuz we do some traffic and uh other related tasks to that that was 10.81% uh boat RV or pods in driveways uh was 8.11% unmaintained pools was 5.41% weeds in the front yard or other um nuisances are related to that is 5.41% plant overgrowth calls was 5.41% uh parking on the grass is 5.41% and fence or wall and just repair uh 5.41% worn out paint on the house was 2.70% and clutter left in the yard uh is 2.70% so with this obviously and in the past we were trying to reach out and um hit just about everything that we possibly can in order to keep the city of b beach clean and TIY any questions Council yes the the unpermitted uh remodeling do you find that it's a lack of knowledge of the contractors or is it more so people just trying to get away with it in most cases that I have dealt with so far understand I've only been doing about half of the the month of December in the case we've had so far I would say probably about half of those is not having knowledge that they need exact permits for what they are doing uh because they are doing you know minor things like maybe just spruing up a bathroom or something of that nature uh ran across that they didn't realize that they needed it I ran across a case just the other day though where um I made contact with obviously some contractors that were going into a garage carrying a whole bunch of construction and made contact with them they were uh very knowledgeable that they didn't have permits even though they tried to tell me I went back and uh to find the permits and run them through the county plus the city and they started scurrying like Co so needless to say they were aware so it's probably about half and half okay any ideas on to how I'm confident if any contractor comes in and asks our city if they need to have a permit then you guys take it from there and there's no issues are there any ideas creative ideas that other towns might use or that we use to increase the opportunity for contractors to stop and ask us before they start any work I mean obviously the ones that are just trying to beat the system they're not going to do that correct the I think that they have plenty of opportunity throughout the week most most of your good contractors you know the ones that are legitimate they know that they need to at least stop into the city at least make contact and say hey we're going to be working out here we're doing such and such work you know do we need uh permits for this type of work the legitimate contractor is going to know that okay the other half just as you said the other half you know they're going to try and do something Shady so you know you whether it be on the weekends or however the homeowner is going to try and do the same thing but we're trying to get out here trying to get out here you know at least one day on the weekends every once in a while and trying to catch those too so we're trying to you know keep everybody uh to one thank you okay any other questions or comments well one comment is that I've noticed recently that when New Pools have been installed it seems like they're frequently um discharge of water and other debris down the street um and then you see sludge and stuff going into the the drain the drains and so I don't know if that's among the construction related nuisances if it's chlorinated if it's relatively clean chlorinated water it would not be but sludge or anything of that nature would you know possibly be a hazard all I could say is if anybody sees something like that give us a call we'll respond and we'll check it out thanks for your effort than anyone else no all right thank you very very much than you very nice to meet you again thank you all right now we have a presentation from the penel sunos fire and rescue District please come up and give us your name rank and serial number good evening thanks for having me assistant chief dougle in charge of fire prevention uh Chief Davidson sends his regards he is up representing our fire district uh in Tallahassee um which is Will directly uh obviously benefit your uh City if all go as well so I'm here to uh this evening to provide our monthly report for December 2023 and uh before I do that U some of the on liced Contracting stuff is something that I try to uh keep an eye on to um when it comes to the multif family business businesses uh residen and business they have a lot Fire Protection Systems so sometimes people go in there and you'll we'll find Lock Sprinklers and and they do these modifications that affect the fire protections thing so um I provided my car to that gentleman because obviously you guys are pretty far away from where my offices but when I drive up and down the beach I I keep an eye out uh for those things as well and I've made contact with uh code enforcement from the county and and the insurers and KY I've have had some other discussions about so it is important and we are uh we do work together to look out for uh the residents of this community so with that being said uh as far as the fire training my colleague Chief carpes this is his area but uh in the month of December our firefighters participated in a total number of 5249 3 hours of firefighter training and to close out the year for 2023 that's a combined hour for our 36 now 39 uh folks of 10,3 and almost 75 hours of training that our men and women have done to ensure that uh they're knowledgeable about the our profession uh when it comes to medical they uh towards the end of the year our uh medical training kind of goes down they try to knock everything out and leave the end of the year for those stragglers that may have missed something out there and remember we're part of the an entire County system when it comes to our medical training so total we had a an online continuing medical education in December and uh that uh consumed 132 hours and a total of5 three and A2 hours of Medical Training uh for the year for a total number of training hours close to 12,000 there 11878 hours of training so again I we always give uh cuos to those about women we continuously learn just like every other profession and um you know ours are ensuring that we're up to date and make sure that we're able to protect your folks and uh the property that you have around here so speaking of that in the month of December we well actually not just us uh responded to 246 11 calls uh within the city limits and of those there was it appears to be nothing of not mostly sick folks and uh couple other Falls so nothing major that I see in these uh the thing that again that we're trying to work on one of the reasons that the chief is up in Tallahasse is trying to get uh this specific one is trying to get money to refurbish our existing Station 27 while we work also on securing our property in the North End of indion Rocks Beach to construct a new Station 27 which will allow us to provide those critical services to you folks who pay the taxes I can tell you uh engine 44 which is Clear Water uh ran 18 of those calls um in your area um that you folks pay the taxes for they only maintain the 77.78% compliance and mayor as you know that compliance uh supposed to be at 90% or over for everywhere in the county so those numbers are concerning to us as a district we want to ensure that we can improve that we feel with the plan that we put in place moving that North we're going to drastically improve those numbers so we get you into that 90th percentile uh coincidentally enough Station 27 ran one of those calls within uh the city and we had 100% compliance so we're not sure again the distance from 44 down here is significantly closer than from 27 so not sure if it's a crew issue or what it is over there at station 44 I can't comment on how they do things but I can tell you that we want to service you um that it the best thing we can give me one second I my notes are on my phone uh as far as fire prevention goes this uh in December apologize all right uh districtwide I didn't break it down in in the Beller Beach but I know approximately a third of them um were up here we performed 134 annual fire inspections 68 reinspection and uh We've perform 16 short-term rental inspections as part of the program that we implemented in Indian Rocks Beach uh we cited 33 violations which uh my team and I are actively working on clearing and as a matter of fact on my way up here I was in a conversation with a gentleman who represents one of your condos just a little bit north of here and he is working diligently uh to come back into compliance with a couple issues that they had at one of the buildings U as far as public education we installed uh three smoke detectors at two separate residents homes none in uh this area uh two were on the mainland and one was in um Indian Rocks Beach um our folks spoke with a half a dozen or less at least what they documented uh as far as um public education handing out fire safety materials and uh things like that lastly uh we are excited um to participate in the upcoming health fair um in October I hired um Stacy Schwab she is the wife of one of our division Chiefs in logistics and she is now the point contact person for all of our public education efforts and she is also working on the short-term rental program as well as assisting myself and inspector Hill in our other annual inspections um we have obtained some funding from the county which we've uh we working hard on as far as bringing some additional Folks up here to participate in the health fair and uh there'll be uh talking about fall prevention and some param medicine stuff and I believe they're going to have some offer up Vital sign checks and and things like that so I know she's worked um with Kyle on uh setting that up so we're definitely excited about that the we just um had a talk with amongst ourselves we have open RFQ for the design build and the P3 process for the Reconstruction of station 28 so we spent about six hours this morning uh ranking those folks and we're actively looking forward to uh making our recommendations to our Fire Commission over the next couple months so that we can um work on getting that money spent of which if you remember was $3 million from uh pal County $2 million in arbit funds and a million do uh that they owed us for uh one of the legal proceedings that we had so we are excited about that again that will benefit you folks we can get that station up and running that'll be our EFC uh we look forward to getting our folks off in a in a permanent place so the district has come a long way in the almost 20 years that I've been involved and it's things are looking up and it can't be done without the support of our uh local communities including uh your city so we certainly appreciate that and we look forward to making progress and keeping the updated Council any questions I do just curious what do you estimate the timeline is to begin construction on the new sure and that's one of the things I think we came to the consensus obviously earlier when we were talking about these rankings and we we put some specific things in that RFP and how to rank these folks but we determined obviously time frame to start and complete construction and the budgeting process always you know we we did come to the the voters and ask for that increase in taxes we want to make sure that we spend that money responsibly like we said we would so ensuring that they we choose the right fir but come into at our budget at least and getting moving forward we have our commission meeting is already on the books it's going to be in before we can get this process done so what I believe and don't quote me on this because I don't make the final decisions but I'm guessing um at our next commission meeting we will um choose at least one or two to come present their case let's say out of our top three ranked we can and ask them to come in and give us a presentation to the board and then uh we would also ask the P3 partnership which the different um RFQ to come in and make their presentation and then the chief will present his recommendation to go through with negotiation so don't quote me on this but I would say hopefully we break break ground by no later than June but hopefully the stars have to Alive we got to make sure obviously there's lots of processes and procedures that we have to go through just like you folks do so we want to make sure that all our tees are crossed and our eyes are doted that make uh that doesn't hold us up so that would be I would say we have to go in make a recommendation and they have to vote and then we have to go in and meet these folks and then start our negotiations and say yes we're going to bring on and let's move forward from there so I would say no later than June and looking at I I'm allowed to exactly say the dates but less than the maximum was a little bit close to 24 months for total construction and some of them were as little as let's say 18 months so depending on the firms but again as you folks are well aware you can't some of these things you just can't can't go on so those are those are their best estimates I'm sure so we're probably looking at a twoyear a two-year window from when we break down to when we take the keys so all right we have our fingers crossed we're certainly keep you updated on it and we look forward to getting this process started just as much as everybody else does absolutely all right well thank you so much for coming out tonight I appreciate the extensive report thank you folks all right uh we are on to item number five which is a presentation of the gfoa certificate of achievement for excellence in financial recording um in the past we walked up certificate that there was no one really to receive it so uh rather than than going through all that what I'm going to do is just read what it's about and then I'm just going to walk over and hand this to Mr Reaper and then we'll move forward uh so this is a uh certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting it's presented to the city of Belair Beach Florida for its annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year uh ended uh ending September 30th 2022 is that right that can't be right yes it is 2022 okay it just seems like 2023 just ended uh by executive director and CEO Christopher P Morel um so uh on behalf of uh uh the CF or gfoa uh we appreciate your uh efforts and all right we're on to item number six it's the moment everyone's waiting for which is the City attorney report Mr Mor you have the floor sorry to disappoint and anybody from meeting um thank you all um I do want to start I think the sentiment expressed by your resident is well stated uh thank you for your service to your community thank you to your colleagues um who who left your your left you as peers at the end of the year I always when I have the opportunity to present to public officials in education I do start by thanking you because the process doesn't work without you and I think that was very palpably felt this last few weeks as we looked towards the future of this community so as your City attorney but also as somebody who just values the the process that we have in our state thank you for your service to the community um as you see we have four members out of our seven and these are the seated members we have the election coming up in March um that that should hopefully fill some of these in addition to anything the town may do in the um City May do in the interim to fill those we also have the charter amendments proposed uh relating to the configuration of this community um apart from that we also have the joy of knowing that session starts tomorrow um the legislative session begins uh tomorrow Tuesday January 9th and will end Friday March 8th as we have as my firm has done in its tenure as your City attorney we will closely monitor that um there was some mention made of the short-term rental program administered by um the fire department uh while this community has restrictions against that there is some legislation proposed that should not in its current form impact your restrictions um today just got a house Court letter it's already moved through one Committee in the Senate that's uh something a lot of Barrier Island communities are watching closely and of course something we would watch for you um I'm happy to answer any questions you may have uh as it relates to the vacancies on the council and the state of councils and commissions and Alderman across the state I can tell you there are more questions than answers um but I'm here to answer any questions may have thank you Mr MOA does anyone have any questions or comments for the City attorney um well I'd like to go ahead and give you a heads up this is this is the council after the election uh there there will be no changes at this time unless we are able to appoint uh so uh like to take just a few moments to uh let everyone know that even though U there's more detail uh invasive financial reporting uh I'm hoping that there are more than four people in this community that are willing to step up and and help us out um obviously we just discussed that if we don't have more than four people sitting here in the desk we we can't have the meeting so uh we're our hands are tied right now and uh I'm I'm begging uh the residents of b beach if you know someone that may be uh a good candidate that would be interested and is not so worried about the financial disclosure please uh reach out to the city manager and let's see if we can fill these seats other than that Mr MOA um I saw and and forgive me because I don't remember the the bill numbers but I saw twin bills both from the house and the Senate about lobbyist and lobbying and you know my idea of lobbying is calling each person on whatever government body it is and saying this is what I think you need to do um is there a different definition of lobbying than what I just said yes Mr Mayor there is um generally speaking under Florida law most especially as it relates to chap 12 of the ethics code when you start talking about what lobbyists can can't do what contributions can be made a lobbyist is somebody who is paid uh to Advocate before uh the legislature or some other governmental body uh there's a registry you have to register in the state as a lobbyist um and so a lobbyist is not simply somebody who is advocating a position to public officials it's not uncommon in this community for you to have residents who may wish to reach all four or seven of you and say hey for example we we really need a new dog park and I want all of you to consider there all the merits of dog parks or pickle ball courts or whatever the thing is that's not lobbying that's advocating lobbyist involves being paid to do that you know whereas if somebody from the national pickle ball Association government relations team whose job it is to persuade and inform government officials that's typically the um construct in which you're actually talking about lobbying in the construct of Florida law of course how people use it colloquially might different but for purposes of Florida law generally a lobbyist is somebody who is paid and registered to Advocate um policy positions before government bodies okay thank you very much well that confirms you're never too old to stop learning Mr Smith Goes to Washington approach is still what a lot of people think of lobing the way I was reading it was that were stripping more of uh basically it looked to me like they were putting trying to put more distance between us and the community so uh I just wanted to touch on that are there any bills that you have on your R are right now principally for me as you might imagine given some of the matters I'm involved in in other communities the short-term ra bill is the one I'm following the closest I have a mediation in seven or eight different cases tomorrow about shter Mars uh it the this session is proceeding a little earlier than some others and so it's a little atypical to have bills so many bills that were filed and had already gotten through a committee but we're still trying to assess the landscape of what's been filed and um according to the legislative calendar today and tomorrow is really the last day to file full bills and get them committee assignments so we have to see which we try to wait till the Hoppers closed to see what's been put in okay and uh one more uh item that I saw was about permitting uh I've seen I I think there were two or three different versions of similar bills uh they were all uh pointing towards Expediting the process right uh now in the case of Belair Beach we have a a two-step process we have the review here in Belair Beach and then it goes to the county is that correct right and so ultimately because we're Contracting Services with the county we would still be responsible if one of these bills were to make it through where we're in a died situation sure and and without speaking to the specific language of those bills like I can tell you is most especially in the last uh three years you've seen a transition especially coming out of the The Fallout of Ian and andalia and other storms that we've had herma as well um a what's emerged is a trend towards private providers uh which is a way for people to have pay somebody to say hey I'm I'm going to do the review for the government hand it over to the government and say to you guys object to this review that I this you know private private provider uh have done and I'm paraphrasing and um trying to simplify but a lot of what what's been put in in the last few years is language say hey if a private provider presents it to you and you don't give it any review or comments in x amount of time well then that's deemed good enough and there's been some push back and I know there are proposals in the current legislature speaking to some of that process and you know permitting deadlines well if they don't you know you can't sit on my permit for 90 days and not do anything if it's not done then sort of this like pocket approval approach and for obvious safety concern reasons there's you know a discourse being had on that issue um once we have the bills um filed again I'll get you a more substantive uh commentary on what that might mean in this community specifically okay I appreciate it uh one last chance anyone have any questions all right thank you Mr Mo I appreciate it now we're up to item seven the city manager's report Mr Reaper thank you mayor so the Golf Boulevard Boulevard undergrounding project um I actually spoke with Duke eny today U they have come that they have gotten their contractor that uh was putting the uh conduit cases in the ground that weren't covered that were brought up at a previous meeting uh in full compliance uh CC member Banker to help assist in the process of drawing attention to it um but to know that now we're uh you know in full compliance uh moving forward in the assured you that uh we wouldn't have any more uncovered uh boxes in the ground um I also found out through the conversation that Duke Energy releases what they're telling me they're planning to start their wiring project of uh phase one in late first quarter so hopefully by February and March they're getting started on phase one um and as you know we're working through the design of phase 2 which is the north of cosway Boulevard so I just keep on trying to get things to move through it's a it's a drawn out project but we are ahead of every other city on the beach so it's a good position to be and um I think it gives us an advantage to to not get kind of held up from from other factors so that makes me happy storm water uh Improvement project uh we've been talking about this for over a year now um started with the bond issue that um is now uh we received our bids and that is one of the items on the agenda tonight um to recommend an award for the project uh we have the RFP for auditing services this is because our old agreement is um it's coming to an end and we need to go back out to RFP one of the requirements for um selecting auditor is you have to form your audit selection committee we talked about this uh last month's meeting and at this point um we have the resolution that appoints our citizens advisory committee um to being the audit committee but it also needs an appointment of a council member to be the chair of that committee so that's something I'd like to um figure out tonight through the council um then our code review service our review Services project that is um kick off at our work session on January 22nd so two weeks and we're have our contractor um from Calvin G Associates com in his name is Mr L CNA and uh he's going to give us an introduction to the whole project and talk about the steps that we going through I also be inviting the Planning and Zoning Board um who will function as our Land Development board for the project so they'll have a lot to do um I'd like to mention the health and wellness Fair um it's coming up on this Saturday which is the 13th of January and it's from 10:30 to 130 we have as of now 26 vendors coming so should a good event this is the act third time third annual and um you know it's a good it's a good chance to come out meet meet other residents and uh see some of the local providers get information get samples um so it's it's just a nice quick event um we provide coffee and other other goodies so please come out and lastly I'd like to mention that our new city clerk Miss Rose received her certified municipal clerk um certification of The International Institute of Municipal clerks um so it's a CMC certification which is a big deal um in being a city clerk um and uh happy to say that she's earned it and I'd like to congratulate her absolutely thank you that's all have okay well you've uh you just told us that we need to app a chair for the a selection committee and it needs to be someone on the council correct correct okay do I have anyone that it's interested in that position I would move for council member Kim uh that was the main reason I wanted to wait the last time we discussed this I think her background and resume would do very well for this position okay great well it sounds like we have uh we have a candidate do we need to take a formal Vote or is that good enough uh I think it would be appropriate just to if Miss Ellie would affirm that she's interested in that at least some oral consensus okay all right so uh we have in front of us a uh we need to vote for chair of the audit selection committee and uh I think we can do it with an all in favor for m Kim Shaw Elliott all in favor I any opposed so you had your opportunity all right congratulations

from uh city of Indian Rocks Beach who was an active project with Harbor Contracting and also did some uh research on the um the other jobs that they've performed reached out to the um the presid owner of Har Harbor uh contrac Aly and confirmed that he had the capability of getting started on this project um you know in the very near future and I actually did receive an email um from the owner president and he gave us a list of all his subcontractors he plans to use and he says that he is looking forward uh to working on this project so he said they get uh started on ASAP with the award and um it is my recommendation to the council based on the engineering report and the information we got back and recommendations um that we award the lowest there for this project and the amount um uh 3,999 18214 and that was actually lower than the uh other bidder by $476 3405 thank you Mr reefer would any citizen like to comment on awarding this project no right citizen comments are closed Council I'm going to need a motion to award project bid B 23-01 to Harbor Contracting LLC do I have a motion I move that we award the project bid number b2301 for the street and drainage improvements from night Street to Morgan drive to Harbor Contracting in the amount of 3,999 821 and the all important 40 do I have a second second excuse me discussion motion uh the motion only gets us to discussion so that's the way you move forward to the discussion so I need a second before we can even talk about it all right second by Kim Shaw Elliot um Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you mayor I think this project has been handled very very well U from our city manager from the design process that we went through as well as the biding process for the a construction um it was approved and recommended by the design firm Who provided the design for this complete project it came in within budget it came with a very very high recommendation by a neighboring City who has used his contractor previously and I think we're ready to go any other questions or comments from the council yes Mr Banker on November 6 uh this year Gemini engineering Mr flu came in to present this I'm sorry M Banker can you just speak into the microphone just for person po I repeat on November 6 Doug flu event uh Gemini engineer came in to present this plan in front of council before we took citizens comments there was a resident now council person that brought up very serious remarks like what is this going to change when I said Mr fluty after looking at the design talking during work sessions once these vals are closed the water is going to be trapped in the streets there's no his order was going to remove be removed unless there's a pump and gave force to move it out his answer to me was I agree that can be found at 319 in the minutes of that beat this is this is the typical metaphor of putting lipstick on the pck yes we're going to put Pig some of the streets here as he's noted one inch of black top all right you can go down my street you can go down Sixth Street Seventh Street Fifth Street all streets that were recently done go down 12 Street in Bay see how many cracks are in here how long has that project been done very short all right I will know Way vote for this project this is this is just wasting our taxpayers money we need to seriously find a way and a solution to resolve this flooding issue flooding is only getting worse in this community uh we're supposed to be a premere city let's be a premier City and attack problems that really are necessary to attack underground light underground wiring is great but we could have took that $5 million and put it to a better use thank you Mr Banker um council member Elliot uh do you have any comments I do um I have concerns about this also um part of it is a sense of urgency and I don't want to be any impediment to Bringing about improvements that we need um at the same time I'm a little concerned as to understanding what it will actually accomplish is it more of an aesthetic thing and repairing the streets or is it actually improving the ability to withstand many of the weather conditions that we're going to be having um in the very near future um we've already had a flood incident just a few weeks ago um there might be another one tonight um that leads to the urgency to get something started and and finished at the same time um I'm concerned about how much money is going to be spent to not end up with anything that's improved um we had the opportunity for a bond issue with more resources coming in and to be able to do it right so I have two questions one is what is different about what this project will produce compared to what our current conditions are if they were working um uh and secondly if there are no improvements over our current conditions would this project allow later improvements without um additional cost I understand incremental cost to do something more but it it will there be buil cost to undo something we've just done Mr reefer would you like to address council members comments yes I think um in the area that you mentioned a change in the way that the flooding occurs I think the most significant um uh change to the actual storm water drainage would be what is proposed at the storm water Swale at Bayside Park um he is adding our engineer Larry fluty he's adding uh two inlets which are the F Type inlets they the great ones um that we have in other parts of the city we did on previous projects adding those right there at the at the uh retention Pond and the the Swale um to help add additional drainage from the n9th street SL Bas side Park area um he's also extending out the pipe from the Swale to to install a 24 in check valve which will actually prevent um the water coming back up through underneath uh Harbor Drive into the retention Pond which back flows into Cedar Drive and Palm Drive um I think that'll make a significant difference it'll provide protection against back flow and flooding up to about I'd say a little over 4 and 1/2 FT elevation of flooding just based on we saw last uh storm so I think that is significant um you can't stop everything because if you get tied water's coming in high enough it's going to go right over the road it's going to come right into everybody's property there just nothing you can do about it and that's uh in my mind is a situation that you know you can we're getting good good return for what what we can install without some new elaborate plan um which can be looked at in the future we've talked a lot about pumps um there may be some areas that we can apply pumps in the city but I think in general from talking to the engineers talking to the pump manufacturers that is going to be a much more a pricier design and I don't know I'd like to see the numbers of what the return would be for the the cost that we're going to spend on it so when you ask me about finishing up these projects which are from the 2016 update to the master plan um unfortunately we did some projects in the South there there have been improvements but um like we see on sth and eth street it's just not quite what we wanted um and a lot of had to do with that again the check valve at the park that doesn't open up unless the tie gets low enough so in my mind it's something that we should Circle back around and look at options um but when we're talking about this project and wrapping up the rest of the master plan um we kind of already got past that part of the city and this is uh this has been on a scheduled list of about 10 different bmps we call them um that were laid out in priority order um to take care of things like the pavement cracking the the valley curve it's all broken up it has a lot of puddling in it um areas that residents in th in those streets have expressed uh uh concern to want it redone to me you know and and in those streets that um we're talking about we're talking about from we just finished on 12th and 13th but we're talking about 14th 15th 16th 17th 18th to um Bay Shore you know 19th 20 all those streets and and Cutters are in very very bad condition and in my uh five years of working for the city and then especially working in the public works department um I've had a lot of conversations with residents in those areas to want the improvements done and we're talking replacing the curve and another uh point was the the uh asphalt that we are installing in the past projects we were Milling one in and and we surfacing one inch um at the request of council member um Roberts uh we are using a a higher grade of asphalt and we're actually Milling an inch and putting back 1.5 in so it is there is difference there um after that you know there's there's areas of this project that we know we have uh known infiltration we have pipe damage that um we're getting a good bid a good price to go through and take care of a lot of that CIP lining that needs to be done that that is maintenance that um has been delayed um to get a better price through this project so I mean that's when you ask the question of what we're doing and what why I think this project is important what impact we're going to see that that comes to my mind if if there is a later study that determines that there are more opportunities for flood control measures um would would implementing those measures involve additional cost because of what we've just done if we're talking about installing a pump system I think the the ideal place to start is where we're seeing the worst problem which is sth and 8th Street and right now we've already gone through there so when you ask me doing this project is it going to require more cost and if we delay this project I do not believe it would because we're not even touching in that area I guess another way to ask the question would be is it cheaper to do it all at one time versus uh instat well that was the idea through kind of wrapping up the master plan was we we took out that number that 2.1 million um with the idea of taking care of the rest of the work that was planned um yeah I guess if we want to go back and do another larger issue have more you know I think the the intent at the time was we had the master plan we were working through it how can we get the rest of it done quicker um you know you know with the money that we have currently but I think kind of what we're talking about now is you know going above and beyond what our original master plan was but I think what the important fact factor of the of the master plan was a lot of it is just general maintenance that needs to be done through the system the pipes the gutters throughout the city like I said the CIP lining that that is the best way to repair some of this the breaking down of the pipes that just need infrastructure repair so I think we're talking like two different scopes of planning um I think we need to go through and get kind of get the basics done and then we we go back to the planning the drawing board and we we try to figure out what can we do to to make the cities the streets better up to a certain point obviously we can't stop everything but I think that is going to be a longer process that really needs to be examined I don't want to stand in the way of of a long thought out project um and I don't like having crumbling streets either they look terrible um so this is not a Premier Community that we say we are when we have streets that look the way they do um I would like to uh suggest to our Council that as we go for additional planning going forward that we really seriously look at improvements because I think we're at a critical stage in terms of uh the safety of our homes here and if we don't act fast we can lose them and we're looking at probably what maybe at least 80% of the homes in this community are um single story homes uh that that don't have accommodations for water flowing through them and we know we have continual flooding um and it's just a matter of time of when it it may hit us so I think we need to plan for that very carefully thank you Miss Elliott uh other comments yes Mr it's it's peculiar that this thing came out in 2016 okay what s eight years ago all right right after her me okay which we it was a tropical storm when it went past us um it was probably 80 miles off the coast 6 in of rain in that storm then we had aot had Irma and we had the Storm at 125 1216 just this past month and like you said there's going to be another one tomorrow night possibly this is foolish bet I mean when Mr fluty came in I said when you put these other drains in that you're talking about you're going to accumulate maybe 300 more gallons when the valve was closed 300 gallons you what nothing okay there's no relief there let's do this right this is $4 million of your tax money your citizens wait what person again would bring a contractor in their home and say I have a problem here in you repair he says and the contractor will say I can do the job for you but you're going to get the same results only government can spend money on something like that no not one responsible citizen there's no way I vote for this project this is just this is just foolish money all right I appreciate I appreciate your thoughts on that um I'm going to weigh in on this um we made a promise to this city uh that we would take care of these regular maintenance issues uh we do have deteriorating pipes we have deteriorating gutters we have uh crumbling streets um no this is not going to solve a problem with title uh store storm surge and torrential downpours whenever the uh whenever the the check vales are closed however uh we were told by Mr fluty that um we could if we decided to do something with pump motors it would it would uh and I think it was also the the pump motor company they stated that yes we could drop in a well anywhere on any one of these pipes that's collecting water and tap right in and pump it out um so I think if we did that it would be another project above and beyond what we already promised the city that we would do um because it it's been a continuous issue it's not just for 7eventh and eighth and 9th Street but it's for the entire city uh so I'm I'm going to vote Yes on this and get this project done but I am still wide open to listening to what's next and how do we uh eliminate this rainwater and storm water whenever it comes in in those lower Ling areas is very important U but we still have to have the rest of the infrastructure upgraded and repaired uh because it's a requirement for all of our city not just one or two streets uh so I set my peace on that uh any other comments no yes Mr go right ahead you have the so there's there's really two things that that um Kim we've discussed in in detail for a couple years regarding there will always be a flooding challenge when we have a high tide and a lot of rain that water is not going to leave the streets ever now I know um council member Banker was a very strong proponent of is similar type projects that we did on 12th and 13th Street so I'm a little little confused by his response today but that's okay um the other question you sort of had was with the streets themselves if we were to put off this project where we have pav streets that are cracking it can actually create a scenario where we will have to spend more money because the water can go down through and start damaging the base then we cannot come along and simply do what we're going to do for this particular project so that can cause the city more money down the road um and I agree with the city manager and the mayor would both of them were saying this is a maintenance project every city and town around goes and evaluates the current status of their streets and if they warrant repair and or replacement that's part of the budget to take care of that and that that's really what we're doing here and and while we're at it we're also taking a look at there may be um some underground pipes that are damaged also so this isn't anything out of the norm I agree that if there's some other unique approaches we can use in the future to somehow address flooding in the streets we should pursue that but it's almost always going to create a scenario where it's very very very expensive and anything with storm water system and you know there's never a goal to create a situation when you're going to have 100% removal of storm water isues it's too expensive never going to happen so that's where we are since my name is man yes okay 12th and Third Street 12th and 13th Street had numerous collapsed pipes and C damage okay that's why I was for that project that project should have gone through I also mentioned wholeheartedly that we need back then a real source to get rid of this order and as M was in here they said clearly if you did this right probably a cat three storm you would see any now $4 million is in front of us this thing got pass tonight we would just be talking about this for another six years and nothing will get done that's how government works and now we have this thing in front of us we have the bond let's retool this and do this thing if we have to take a little bit more money to get to get this done right let's make Ninth Street our city ball nth Street res as MW MW pump set try one or two streets see how it works okay and then you may want to try a couple more streets all right let's make this the premier example of FL and that's Mr record I'm going to leave uh leave you with the last word and uh I'm going to call for a vote Renee would you please call the RO please council member bankard no council member Roberts yes council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis yes so it's 3 to one and uh Mr reer you are authorized to award the contract and harbor Contracting L you need a majority of as seated as seated it's not four of the seven when there's no sense just as if just as if we had normally had a meeting and five people show up the vote is um the majority of the council in this instance it's the majority of the council has seated you have a four member Commission of majori three members City Attorney question then why do you need um four people have a meeting I understand po but I mean if you if it's just uh makeup then I'm sorry I'm not understanding your question this phras to conduct a meeting okay yes sir you needed four to pass a vote when you have the charter says you need seven I believe our Al says you need for has v to I don't believe that's I'm not looking at the charter in right this moment as I was not different if you don't have enough members I'm not sure I I'm I'm happy to review the matter uh member Banker I will tell you in my practice I have served on councils that I've had less than the full composition of that board and traditionally well Quorum is required for you to be able to uh and and your quum is in fact defined by your Charter a majority vote of the council is seated is typically required of any um of any matter not a majority of the members that are not there in that case um everything would have to be unanimous going forward I I don't believe that aligns with the construct but I'm happy to look at it as I was not presented with the question prior to um this meeting I'll add a comment to that if uh if you're sitting on a council where there's one member that always votes no all business with seats within the community uh so uh there's just no way that that would be in our Charter uh however I will give you time to look that up and uh and just make Banker feel good that we are doing the right thing so section 2.07 of the of your Charter says the Quorum um accept as provided in 2.06 C majority of the council shall constitute a quum no action of the council shall be valid unless adopted by affirmative vote of at least four members of the council so no action of the council shall be valid unless adopted by the affirmative vote of at least four members of the council is in section 2.07 of your city Charter um in that you do have uh four members reading that in context it says City Council meetings I'm just trying to read it I'm trying to read the whole thing um to make sure I'm not missing any context and again I I had not been presented with the query prior uh voting on ordinance and resolutions shall be by roll call and recorded by the city clerk let me see what the exception referenced is 2.06 C is filling vacancies a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council uh any person appointed by Council to Fil A vacency shall hold office until the next annual election if at any time the m membersip the council's reduced to less than a quorum the remaining members May by majority vote appoint additional members in Conformity with the section or shall call for a special election so it it does contemplate um less than a uh all four members voting to fill the vacancy and makes the and that is taken from section 2.06 C uh looking to section [Music] to 2.07 acceptance provided in the section majority of the council shall constitute form no action of the council shall be valid unless adopted by the affirmative vote of at least four members of the council reading those together in in context I would have to agree with member bankard um that your Charter does in fact provide that no action of the council is valid unless adopted by affirmative vote of at least four members of the council uh you have four members um which again is not a uh traditional um traditional construct it's contemplating no action of the council shall be valid unless inducted that presumes the construct of you having seven members um but forgive my frustration as I was um it's it's quite all right would you like a few minutes if we could take a moment to Res let's TR 10 you think that's enough more than enough mayor I don't think it should take that long I agree with the language I need to read it in context all right we'll be back at uh 7:22 all right we're back um Mr Mor thank you and as my uh awon supervisors thank you for the Indulgence of of the uh recess for the opportunity to analyze this I I've searched for majority votes and looked at what this States the the language is explicit in Quorum that unless there's a vacancy a majority of the councils in quum but no action of the council was valid unless adopted by affirmative vote at least four members of the council that could read in different Fashions a majority of our remain of the council could read in a few different configurations that configuration is explicit um is four members of the council must approve something to be um in order for it to be adopted by this Council so I would stand by my um initial impression upon review of the language of member Banker is correct it fails as a 3-1 vote um because it is not an official act um adopted by a vote of at least four members of the council there's no modifying language after Council to say the council has seated or the council sub subject to vacancies it is simply for members of the council it's an independent clause from the exception referencing 2.06 the vacancy appointment procedure so um the uh the proposed bid award fails on a 3 to1 thank you very much and congratulations Mr banker and also I'd like to uh thank the legislator uh in Florida in Tallahassee uh for really sticking it to the city of b beach all right uh now we're moving on to item number 13 this is for authorization of a soul Source purchase of a wro was stop um 24in valve for Street and drainage improvements project b2301 since the project uh has not been awarded uh is it do we vote on this anyway in the event that I I don't know how to handle this actually if uh we need four votes to proceed member Baker is not in agreeance with this you can still put the Val I need to have the uh the alall the CT Chang to valve valve is at end discharge yeah it's at the discharge but the way it is now it's at this point it appears we're having a substantive discussion on the matter you may wish to just correct all right Mr would you just explain what it is we're discussing and then will go to the citizens for comments sure um so what this is is uh this is part of the plan project um it is um the purchase of a 24 in check valve this is the same uh check valves we've been using throughout the city they've proven to work well um with as long as you keep up with the maintenance on them but in experience of of all types of these valves is still it's the recommended design um for a valve and and they have been successful throughout the city um so this you know for our purchasing procedures um we are allowed to make this purchase um based on it being a a patented Soul Source purchase um so I was recommending that we approve the purchases of valve um because um it will stay in Alliance or it'll maintain the continuality of of the vals we've been using and and it is still recommended by our engineer um in other cities so um yeah it is I mean purchasing the valve as a 24-in valve we have other 24in valve pipes I don't and see how we would change the desire what we're trying to do moving forward so um this may be still something under consideration um because it's money we have and it's a about that we can use so presented it that way thank you Mr Reaper um let's go to the citizens for comments anyone like to uh make a comment on this topic okay okay I'm going to need a motion to authorize this purchase motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by council member Elliot Mr Banker do you have the floor SI to discharge put down if the SW is 24 in okay Mr yes um if I understand the memorandum um the city manager hasth to make any expenditures under $10,000 is that correct so if there's something that uh this project needs that would have been supplied by the storm water project would that be within your authority to authorize those expenditures it's in other words would it be probably less than a $10,000 expense well the reason that I mean that is our our govern quoted price um the reason that we do it this way is because we can get a better deal for these valves if we purchase it as a government entity supposed to including in the project so in the past we've made all these purchases at the government quarter prices um but the way the the uh purchasing policy from our Charter reads um I'm allowed to purchase uh non-competitive supplies and access of ,000 provided authorized funds are available the annual budget and the uh records of purchasing exceeding the $10,000 are available by public um so earlier in that section it says expenditures between 10 and $25,000 um I I apologize but I'm not hearing very well I'm sorry so I'm just and I I'll I'll go to the City attorney just for his interpretation but the way I understood it was that you know once you get between1 and $25,000 that um it can be approved upon rece of at least three written bids or proposals um but then there's an exception for non-competitive supplies um so that's the reason the language um City attorney speaking the language being referenc is not in the charter um it is in your your code of ordinances or it's in your code of ordinances in chapter 2 um section 2-35 I think what the the manager is saying is between the range of $5,000 and $110,000 um he has um he has some Authority May authorize an expenditure in excess of five not more than 10 with you if it's within the approved City budget with the specific approval of the city council upon receipt of at least two written bids so if he's over five under five you can just go get over five but than 10 he's got to show you that hey i' I've gotten some written bids and these are the costs um your question is a little different than that from as I'm understanding your question M sha Elliot and forgive me if I'm mischaracterizing it I I'm was understanding your question is say beyond the purchase of this valve if there are other elements that would be required for the installation um of this valve will those elements cost less than $10,000 was that your question or would or would they whether regardless of the amount would they be within his authority to authorize that purchase yeah and again it's going to it's going to come down to I I think on some level his his authorization set forth in 2-35 if those are less than $5,000 he has some Authority if it's over five but less than 10 he has slightly less Authority and and I and while I do not know and I'm not involved at all in the administration of capital Improvement projects want to be very clear about that um if I'm not sure that manager reer is in a position I I think I I suspect he was approaching this action item presuming the other action item may have been approved absent its approval I don't know if he has done an analysis on what he would need in the ways of Labor and materials to implement this Hardware once purchased um I think his construct was to acquire this hardware and install it as part of that project that project having failed I think he's left with questions he may not be in a position to answer you on specific costs but again as I am not involved in capital Improvement projects and decisions I defer to the manager Mr reefer let me ask you a question is this valve uh was your intention to replace an existing valve or was this for a brand new valve the brand new construction brand new valve for this W okay so if we approve this you would have an extra valve just sitting around correct at this point it was the plan was part of the project so I guess okay is valve there now no say put this Val on that I believe the angle on the C it would need some modification right it could it could go on that way simple modification yes and Randy you would know this much better than I but um in a previous life working for a county I know some people that got extended non-paid vacations because of purchasing violations where you try to say okay we're splitting this up you know we're lying the valve now we're going to have to spend money on some other stuff so they were able to keep the cost down below below certain purchasing values and you cannot do that if it's all related to a project somebody's going to throw a red flag and say that's I I think what member Roberts is referencing are the requirements of the CCNA um and other purchasing U measures you are correct to say that you cannot or you can't say well you can't take a project to break you know for instance in the ethics code as I often teach you're not allowed to get uh you have to report a gift that's over $100 you can say well this was a $95 gift on Tuesday and then I got a $95 gift on Wednesday and then I got a $95 now you got you know a sum total of nearly $300 from this person and you know again the same is true of of in the procurement world again because I think there are a lot of questions you know member Banker has taken the position that hey this is an easy fix and easily adapted um as we sit here now I that may be true I I don't know I don't know what the the ger again in terms of parts and labor nor am I apping on it um but we would have to look at that as its totality and not say well this part cost this much and this part cost that much you know this is $6,000 that's that's $5,000 and the labor is 3,000 so we never went over 10 you would look at that as potentially going over 10 and again I'm that's putting aside the CCNA for a home so um which is the competitive um bidding statute so again that's yes pending Contours and I'm just putting Point pointing out that this valve probably has a female sleeve adapter to it that will fit on the thing without too much trouble that's that's what I I think the problem is is that the way that this purchase request is uh written it's saying for Project B 23-01 um do we need to make a motion to amend the motion uh to just say I need a check Val or do you even need a check Val anymore and you prefer to wait until we get this project resolved at this point just because everything kind of got changed um I I recommend that we just wait um because if I can figure out something else in the near future then we can just bring it to next I wish I'd asked you that 10 minutes ago motion t all right there's a motion to table there's no discussion um I need a uh need someone to second that motion second second all right this is for a motion to table all in favor I any oppos all right it's table all right now we're on to item 13.1 this is for electing a vice mayor to replace Jody Shirley um I'm going to handle this uh in this order so everyone knows what I'm doing uh the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take nominations going to write them down then we're going to do uh we're going to go to Citizen comment I'm sorry um we're going to go to citiz and comments uh to discuss whoever is nominated and give them the opportunity to do that and then we're going to take an informal vote on the nomination to see if we have a majority if we have a majority then we'll need a motion to elect the winner to become the seat of vice mayor Mr MOA did I get that right I believe so mayor okay cool all right uh so do we have any nominations Nom all right we have one for Frank Banker I would like to nominate L Roberts do we have any other nominations all right seeing as we have no other nominations we have Frank maker and Lloyd Roberts let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment on these two nominees I'm Mike Kelly 2740 hibiscus Drive I um strongly support the mayor's nominee Lloyd Roberts with all your background that you had it's Swift Mud your engineering background understanding of this city your experience with this city I think he is the candidate that should be your vice mayor thank you Mr kayy do we have any other citizens that would like to make a comment seeing as we have none comments are closed all right uh so now what we're going to do is we're going to do an informal vote uh so uh if you would would you please call a rooll and let's uh let's get a count here council member B myself Banker council member Roberts Lloyd Roberts council member Shaw Elliott Mr Roberts and mayor gtis Mr Roberts uh and I believe that that only requires a majority uh mayor as I as I look at your your your your Charter the language of your Charter is it say say no action of the council shall be valid unless adopted by the affirmative vote of at least four members of the council uh you are attempting to take the action of identifying and appointing the vice mayor that's being done by the council um it would be my opinion consistent with that language that you need for members of the council to agree absent an agreement you would continue to proceed without a vice mayor this okay so be it um so in that case right now the majority U the majority is 3 to one for Mr Roberts um now we're going to need a motion to um a motion to elect the winner of that vote so do I have a motion to move forward with Lloyd Roberts as vice mayor do that that can we do that that was vote so we have a majority to bring forward whenever we actually do the motion now that's if if we have two people then we can actually vote on to El all right so do I have okay so Lloyd Roberts and do I have a second uh a second okay second all right Mr Roberts you have the floor yes um thank you very much much for for the nomination um way back when when I first decided to express interest for the city of Ard beach I was actually very interested in a mayor position but having spoken um with Mr Gadis at that time and some other people he was clearly the best person to build a position of Mayor I've been very confident that U anytime I would need to step in and um sit in the mayor's seat for mayor gtis uh as the vice mayor I would love that opportunity I have taken the opportunity to sometimes sit in based on his requests when he couldn't meet some meetings um representing our city I feel like I have the background and the education and the skill set to support this city very well and I would look forward today thank you thank you Mr barers do we have any other comments yeah I don't think Mr Roberts is uh qualified to be the vice mayor he's I think I'm a senior member of council here besides you Mr Mayor um apparently I know the CH a lot better than most of council members um my history shows that man sitting in that chair I nominated him back in March of last 20 22 and uh he went through an 8 month circus looking for a city manager and we just gave this man an award tonight for excellence U my background for infrastructure I think was it's more qualified than anybody here a uh I ran me to 6,000 members I'm a pretty good student Robert rules I don't think we have the proper C and I don't believe we can put him on all right any other comments I I think we have two qualifying candidates um who bring very different things to the table um I recognize that there have been Divergent views and that um there's been some contention when those views are expressed it um it presents opportunities when you look at at two um people with opposing views are forced to work together so that that raises some interesting opportunities here but um I believe both people have qualified thank you very much uh I'm not going to make any comments instead I'm going to call for a vote M Rose would you please call the rooll council member bankard council member Roberts yes council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis yes and uh so I will continue without a vice mayor and uh we'll see how it goes all right I'm up for the challenge by the way all right now we are up to item number 14 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business see as we have none now we're on to council comments this month we begin with council member Roberts mayor I'm sorry I'm sorry I Mr Kelly I apologize deeply because you've been waiting all night and you've been very patient so uh what I would like to do is bring Mike Kelly in for a board of adjustments report thank you Mr attorney and thank you Renee we're getting used to a lot of new procedures here and this is just a minor one um Renee asked me to stop in tonight if if available to give you a report about the board of adjustment these are quarterly reports over the past three months the board has actually had two meetings we had one in October well Patty was still here we had one in December which Rene ran very very well um and and it's we had um four different residents who wanted uh anything from pools to rezoning of lots to encroachments into setbacks for for improvements to their homes and the board did an outstanding job once again the issues about pools being above the crown of the road is the primary one Kyle's already got a plan to have it taken care of in the new year and um if there's any questions i' be glad to I will make the comment to you that our board because we're getting so many meetings and I think so much different experience with so many different residents we have a very very well-groomed and well well informed um board and alternates we've been using our alternates as well so I'm thankful for the choice the Council made and if there's any questions I'll be glad to answer Council thank you Mr Kelly I appreciate your patience and I appreciate your service to our community you're keeping this interesting today thank you very much thank you all right now we're on to council comments this month we begin with council member Roberts thank you Mr Mayor um I I'm really um saddened for La of a better word of the the fact that we were red to before council members at this particular time I know I can't walk in everybody's shoes I think I made that comment before I have taken the opportunity to um listen to a presentation that I believe was sponsored by the part of Le of cities concerning the form six and have compared that to the form one which is why I'm I'm still here because I really don't think personally again it could be different for other people that the additional information that's going to be required for the form six is that significant so I'm really speaking to people that may be listening to this meeting tonight that are out there and live in our city so that some additional citizens will step forward and hopefully take other positions on our city council it's um it's important and and a funny story I was just talking to somebody tonight that owns a um pretty significant Siz business and the reason I'm telling this story is I always feel like if there's bad people out there and they want to find out about financial situations with anyway they can do it this this person I was talking with tonight actually got a phone call that came on a cell phone number that had his Banks his business bank's name on it and after several questions and and this person knew his account for his Corporation knew how much money he had in the accounts he kept following up with different questions to this man to where he finally backed him into a corner and and the guy admitted he was not with the bank so the point of that story is there's people out there that I think are feeling like well I really don't want to be in this position because of the form six because it becomes public and I don't want people knowing that information I guess my message is if people want to find out Val your financial situation they can and they will so I don't really think that should be a a huge reason to not want to come forward and represent our city so like the mayor said earlier um please some other the people out there come forward so that we can fill our seven member Council the way it is today thank you thank you Mr Roberts now let's go to council member Kim Shaw Elliot well I'm happy to be here um I appreciate the opportunity to be of service to the community I look forward to the next year I think we have a lot of challenges ahead of us and I think we've got good people in place now that um can work through these challenges and bring about a better community and I hardly support council member lyd's comments that we need others we need our community active and involved for those of you that are Civic minded and and want to be able to be part of the solutions for this community I hardly encourage you to step forward thank you Mr Baker well I wasn't going to uh run um and I didn't file during the appropriate time period okay and I was against the opening up the charter or opening up the ordinance to extend in a week and then we had the storm coming and um BN residents came up to me and they said what the hell are you doing about all right I just repaired my garage got three Ines in last night my neighbor she hasn't been in at home since it down okay so I'm thinking I asked God I said is there a message here that I should run for counsel right Dave I like it a great guy I may we have some differences I want to work with you I wanted to work with the other mayor okay but I'm not going to I'm not going to vote on something that I cannot doot right as I got thrown under the bus from 12th and 13th Street Mr Roberts you voted against 12th and 13th Street okay it's time right but then you vote for this all right so I want to do what's best for the city because I really do love the okay and just like those boxes that were open Kyle I mean you went to Duke all right and I don't know who thumbed their nose at yet I had some friends from oia 48 hours later those boxes are covered up all right so I want to do what's safe for the city with the booies okay they're I think they were very important and then I have people that are cing me go C their Shores and say well we don't need our money need spent when you're sa the issues those people have grand kids this is just petty and that's exactly Mr Robert I'm sorry Mr Banker uh please refrain from the uh bullshit's not a say is I want to serve the people of b beach not the one my said the deceitful T they can go P wherever they want to go P all right but I want to do what's best for the city when I was inherited 10 years ago and that's all my that's all I want to do I volunteer for every event that comes up in this city every event I don't go for the photo ops like some of these candidates do I'm out there sandbagging I'm out there I missed two Beach cleanups okay since Beach cleanup exist I missed one beach one Bridge clean up okay my backward in all right I'm there all time volunteering and Kyle can attest it all right so I want to do what's best for the city I think this is the greatest City with volunteers all right and when it came up last year about paying for councel I wanted to coohom and bombing all right picking picking money out of the taxpayers pocket to pay for this is nonsense that's all I and happen all right well I hope everyone's watching out there as you can see where we're at at the moment uh it's not a good situation um we desperately need three more council members uh we need people that um will at least give us the opportunity to decide what's best for the City without being uh in a strangle hold by any particular one single council member uh so uh if you live on one of the streets that's not going to be paved uh you've got crumbling pipes you have crumbling whatever in your in your area of the city and you're unhappy with the outcome of tonight's meeting I implore you please come down apply and uh and show up so that we can make an appointment for three more council members uh other than that uh thanks to everyone for watching tonight and would someone like to make a motion to adjourn motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Lloyd Roberts all in favor I any opposed all right good night everyone"
