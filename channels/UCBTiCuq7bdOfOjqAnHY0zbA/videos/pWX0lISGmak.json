    "transcript": "started all right so I'll call the meeting to order at the first agenda item is to approve the agenda so we gotta get a motion to approve the agenda I shall move so uh Mark Goldman first on Valley in second yes Paula Taylor um okay second is approval of the September 21st 2022 uh citizen advisory committee meeting minutes we all had a chance to review it gonna get up motion I shall move work I seconded it okay all in favor all right any opposed okay and then the third item is uh approval of the November 22nd citizens advisory committee meeting minutes I'll move to accept those and prove those for November 22nd thank you Mark pal second is that good I'll second it go ahead okay yeah okay all in favor all right all right any opposed okay we're done with that so we'll move on to the topic of discussions about somebody coming in uh fire chief okay um so the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss uh City Bond options and fees and uh you know we started talking about this uh first it was presented in these prayer bits that we just approved that the notion to look at taking the million dollar hurricane Reserve cash and do we take half of that use that for projects it did put a lot of credit in place for that but as we did our homework in the fall the banks uh it was not cost effective it would have been about ten thousand dollars a year in a commitment fee and another ten thousand dollars in attorney fees so it just didn't seem like the right thing to do but in our conversation with Chris Rowe who's our the bod Council the city is historically used uh and one of the banks that we were working that we've worked with South State they recommended baby taking a look at you look at what your long-term projects are and it might be better to to to uh do a long-term Bond financing and so what Kyle did is he looked at the next future years of projects and so this is basically accelerating you know four years of storm water projects is what we're proposing here into a 2 billion one hundred and twenty thousand dollar maximum uh Bond issuance or load over a 10-year period and so uh I put the summary together uh as we look at how those costs would come together and so we have two two bids one from South State Bank and one from Valley Bank uh both 10 years South state was at 4.36 percent it valleys at 4.50 and again these are uh what's called a bank qualified load so that is the bank gets the benefit of an interest rate discount uh for their tax purposes that's why you know at today's right this is you know the 10-year treasury for example I believe was at the 3.9 that look like earlier today so that's kind of a gauge Point uh both of them have a semi-annual payment terms uh South state has no prepayment penalty if we just use excess cash but if we were to refinance it with another lender down the road that there's a one percent prepaid penalty of the outstanding balance of the outstanding balance is that all true for the entire length of the 10-year term yeah a valley had offered prepayment and so just you know part of the eggs to that is the current bond issue we have with uh it was such trust originally uh it it's had a prepayment penalty for the entire 20-year term and so back when we had uh some cash reserves it interest rates were at zero our payoff was exceptionally High because it's really a make hole provision today that prepayment is basically zero but but because rates are what they are doesn't make sense to pay it off and so uh South State uh has in-house legal fees of 3 000 Valley has 7 500 is what their Council has told them that uh South state had to add a dilution test of 1.25 times which is basically a debt service coverage test Valley did not put one in their term sheet but most likely they would have one today there's currently a 1.25 coverage test with the truest bot Etc spot uh South State uh put in their term sheet a requirement of a bit of a half a billion dollars five hundred thousand dollar compensating deposit ballots Valley noted they would like a deposit ballots uh we got the both to know what their deposit rates would be so they pay out balances South state pays what's called uh effective fed funds and so that's 4.58 today minus 50 basis points so 408. Valley will pay Target fed funds which is 475 minus 50 basis points which is 425. so it's interesting Valley charges a little bit more but they'll pay more on the deposits uh yeah and so I'll get back to that how that I see that potentially being in a regular Nation big thing is we look at total cost of the bot so the interest expense I ran the amortization schedules which you guys have and you can see what that interest expense is over the 10-year period if it went to full term with each of the bank's legal fees are so that gives you you're basically you're twenty two thousand dollars more to go the valley route versus uh the South State Route and then I also broke down uh so our what we're really looking at financing is two billion 73 354 dollars the bot council is quoted as 18 000 which is seventeen thousand five illegal fees 500 legal expenses because uh Chris Rowe uh bright Bell or Olive is the firm he's based in Tallahassee so he will need to come to city council so that's the coverage his printing visas travel visa covers that get the resolution signed and whatnot does this have to go before the judge again to it will not doesn't have to will not so it just uh so the thought process is for us to discuss this today and if we have a recommendation we will uh forward it to city council uh for a workshop they don't need to go out to the residence yeah city council government okay uh our our uh contract with our City attorney has it stipulated the contract that if there is ever a legal opinion required with a city financing need he gets 75 percent of the bond Council fee so that's why his fee is thirteen thousand one twenty five which is 75 percent of the Seventeen five and so you know we're going to require or the the bank and the mod is going to require our Law Firm to create an opinion that the city has the legal life and status and ability to enter into this financing agreement and then so that I added back to bank legal fees and so that's where you see uh here where we come down to uh the difference in the Total Bond deed of financing so 2 billion 107.5 versus 2 billion one one point uh [Music] yeah yeah not a big it's really it's the 4 500 difference in the in the bank's legal fees so as we look at the bond financing yield you know the benefits of it is that the residents get their storm water projects accelerated so uh Kyle I don't think we set that up that wasn't in the suburb sheet but we we did uh what were the streets again the streets of the project yeah okay it wasn't it a wasn't it stated by the residents in general or in Mass that we really needed to make a effort to get this done a lot quicker than in 10 years and that I mean that is why we are sitting here tonight discussing this because we as the folks that make recommendations felt as if it was in the best interest of the city and the city residents told us on more than one occasion that it should be a very high priority yeah so the residents have spoken to say this is a priority in some of the council has spoken as well so we have a project 17th and 18th Street 19th and 20th Street along with 9th Street and then 22nd and 23rd Morgan and 25th and last would be 14th through 16th Street so that would take this all the way through our master plan with the exception of the marina which there is no high importance for doing anything in the marina we don't have a major flood issue there so uh Mark brought up a point earlier when we first talked about this we were thinking more like this could be like a four billion dollar bond issue it's but we were throwing into that uh number of a couple things that were not today so what item was the balance of the payoff of this building is 460 000 since there's no benefit with the uh prepayment uh plus the fact that uh Chris Rowe our attorney said if we refinance it we lose the tax uh free oblique the tax-free benefit so it would become a taxable load at that point uh it refinancing that piece uh so that was one component second one was we had talked about adding the billion dollar uh Gulf undergrounding to this financing but in Kyle and his doing his calculations was that if we had budgeted the billion dollars for storm water that we're now replacing with arpa Buddy the 802 000 that the optic wasn't appropriate to finance that billion dollars and as you can see it will go through the financial statement there's sufficient cash to flood that out of out of the cash flow so that's a drivers that brought it down to the two billion one uh financing D so again the benefits our residents get uh storm water projects accelerated to just the savings on the mobile mobilization fees well we anticipate that being a quarter of a billion dollars in savings uh three what's interesting today is now the interest on our cash reserves is almost going to be an Arbitrage to the cost of financing so just assuming if we go with South State which is the lowest at 408 and we take our cash and move into Valley if we're getting four and a quarter today but as the FED keeps raising rains that's going to keep going up yeah yeah we'll we'll make money for the near term well yeah in the short run and then if my fourth bullet point out the benefits I said the city has the ability to accelerate repayment within five and a half years reducing our total interest expense uh to 342 000 instead of 521 000. and if we anticipate the gross revenue of the city to increase as we have over in the past we should have plenty of cash to make that happen right at the right time so we'll we'll be saving that other money by doing it this way as well and getting the project completed which is sort of needed so the package that you guys were saying that's uh there's the amortization schedules for the two uh facilities there's the two term sheets from the bays and the key is Heather who spent a lot of time our city finance officer in putting this uh forward-looking budget together so if you look at the front page of the budget it says at the top uh city of Baylor Beach General flood projections this is the first page yep so the top line is our fund balance so that's our cash so we finished uh last September 30th at 4.35 died in cash and what we're projecting uh at the end of this fiscal year if we do that this is you know putting this bond issue in here we finish it 5.477 we finish September of 24 at 6.1 September of 25 at 5.5 almost and then uh and what's driving those years is we've got a billion dollars each year with the undergrounding project in the 23 24 24 25. so then that Buddy's done we get buddy back from the county so 25 26 our cash goes up to six and a half billion 26 27 it goes to 6.8 million so that's where I built in you know basically at the end of year four we take a billion dollars and prepay it and then do we just follow the schedule out and so we'd have you know basically three more payments uh if we kept the same payment we'd be done in five and a half years at a three hundred forty two thousand dollar cost now we don't have to but I was thinking of Mark's Point what if we get out and you know hey we're making more money or deposits that we are below the good news is the city will have the flexibility yeah with with no prepayment it's not we don't have to do it right but I think they could still recommending the city being good stewards of the residents buddy these are ways to make it happen yeah and and I think it gives us a little bit of a hedge against having that emergency fund of 500 000. and instead of a million because we know we we've got cash so what I did do if you look back at the general fund projection of the flood balances of Kyle and Heather these these next uh five lives are the different cash components so we have the other side cash the cash a cited capital projects what we budgeted for transfers between different uh funds the key part is is here's our required Reserve so we have a 20 our Charter requires us to have a 20 cash Reserve so we wanted to make sure we illustrate to city council what that looks like and then our uh uh were required you know through an ordinance to maintain a billion dollars in Hurricane preparedness cash reserves so you know we can put you know the hurricane cash into this you know higher interest bearing you know checking accounts you know or money market account uh and uh the other thing about Valley in their term sheet as you might see on deposits is they also noted that they will not charge any transaction fees or deposit service charges which I know there's some charges right now with the existing relationship but truest so Heather is open to exploring with the two bags what those options could be so uh we could find a New Hope for you know the city's deposit relationship South state does not have a branch nearby their closest branch is at 580 but with uh technology today you don't necessarily have to have a branch nearby but sometimes it's nice if you need to run up for some cash but you know I think we could probably we could keep a small cash account local bank we could park a half a billion dollars to be nice to them get the 4.08 right then we have all the fees associated with all the cash are just related to this specific 500 000 account yeah so uh so it it all uh uh I guess transparency so I'm a former executive for Valley okay and uh they didn't have a municipal person when I retired uh nearly two years ago but today they have a beautiful person they hired from Chase and they created a product that is for all communities be free wow I mean that adds up to a lot of money so Heather our finance officer reached out to her counterpart at the city of Bellaire Bluffs and said hey I need some could you do something for my buddy they brought the whole new program up so they waived fees and brought them up to the higher you know interest rate so she's already gotten a good reference from the city of Bel-Air and Valley has a local yeah it's right right up the street great so uh we did not go out to a full bid we're not required to go out to a full bed South state has done the last two small financing bids we did so it I think was a 2016 or 2018 the Bellevue Estates [Applause] solid state for stormwater so we get the undergrounding of the utilities through a bond issue for the homeowners in the Bellevue Estates and South state provided that financing and then what we created the new storm water Reserve storm water flood that South state provided that funding so they do have experience with the city of being our finance partner and I'll throw it open to questions see what you guys is there any access carries like is there any interest rate risk by the time they lock in on the singer is there the interest rate is frozen to tell or we're we're locked in until April 7. so the thought process was is we have a committee BD I forget first Monday of April which we if I get this approved bed we get it and the valley rate uh it just it all if you can see the dates of the term sheets came in so I reached out to the valley team and I said Hey FYI there's another bid you're now the High bed and they called me back uh yesterday and just said you know we're let's we're we'll hold we'll commit to the four and a half but that's as low as they could go so it did go back to the well just to see but uh well and I think that there would be a problem with giving the loan to um State and opening the account with Valley you know when they each are getting something okay but um if there isn't a huge difference you know we should it looked like it was that big of an overall difference when everything was taken into effect what definitely said it was like forty five hundred dollars overall cost difference between the two and the interest yeah we probably make up for that anyway the difference in the interest that they're paying every year okay hey top okay it's not needed stop is he muted the click on the hands and uh can you hear us going all right we'll just continue until we figure this out [Music] thanks guys camera things yeah I I booted him out hopefully he could join them should I text him to rejoin I'd advise another question yeah I assume the incremental costs associated with the capital projects over 10 years with inflation and all that kind of stuff you know well exceed kind of what we're looking at we didn't know how to build that in yeah but we would think that the material savings Yeah by accelerating at all and getting kind of a bulk price yep yeah exactly expands your potential Thunder yeah so we'll go out for with a new RFP for yes the remainder of the word great all of a sudden it'll get Cheaper by the existing contractors wait you know that laughs uh you have a passcode no he should be using the same link he had there's no passcode he got just like in my office yeah I don't see him I mean he joined twice since uh I opened the meeting so he should be at least exact same like foreign yeah since we can't see him [Music] what does arpa stand for I should know that but the American Rescue plant all hacked foreign take it [Music] hello hey Tom I can hear you just fine yeah on myself we couldn't hear you on the link though yeah she kept showing uh the hostess um disconnected you for the meeting so if whatever it is this is just defined I I might this is fine if it's okay I had a couple of questions or points um the uh uh anticipating you know the city council is going to ask how was it uh these two Banks were the finalists uh we have a question we have an answer to give them uh yeah I mean what I would state is that you because I do Valley be where I had formerly worked into South state is that our last two financing requests and uh when I talked to uh SunTrust truest for the revolver at 500 000 they said it was too small to even bother with and uh my flight is from Bank of America or chase or regions or cogent or the others yeah they uh I know I coach it uh but I do know them but I didn't bother uh but I know the the bigger regionals uh like a buddy who does all the beauty work for TD and they they're the lowest deal they'll do is 100 billion okay fine so there's an answer for that he could paint everybody's house our Focus forward to her former employee does anyone else just for full disclosure or transparency have any other business interests or employment or ownership in either the two Banks I don't know no no no no okay good that's that's on the record that's great um and uh you mentioned that some of the the perks between the two bags Rodney Davis here on the inside and know how these Packs work and what perks are significant so it really comes down at the costs are virtually the same for the loan which which do you think has the more significant perks that are important for the city well honestly thought my recommendation is we take the best of both so we take the lower rate with Sal state okay then uh and then we you know give Heather and Kyle the option to you know you explore this Bank the city's banking business with Valley uh and your Valley did commit to me that even if we don't do the load that the FED funds minus 50 and the no transaction fees is still on the table okay and that's [Music] and that's not it's inhabitants otherwise otherwise we would overwhelm the branch it with the wrong kind of attention before sewer projects sooner like you said uh but then there's the the citizens have a concern about displacement and stuff with a lot of construction going on that's not our call yeah so I you know we had our street Donato uh resurfaced I mean it was the gutters were taken out it was a little paint but uh you know these these I think some of these residents their streets uh have flooding issues and so they'll put up with the short-term pain to get the long-term results in two years what's the question what's the what's the plan's length the duration the timeline I would say is definitely under two years for once the project starts once it uh but it would be all the streets all at one time uh tored up you they would move methodically you know uh Street to Street to Street uh and get get you know get the storm water work done get the repaving done as they're digging up you know the next neighborhood they're Paving the last neighborhood and so there's more of a flow to it Tom they're not going to expand the contract time from a regular sunwater project maybe 30 days but probably not because they're just gonna put more equipment yeah I didn't quite hear that last sentence but guys it all sounds good I say that that uh by doing five projects at once isn't really going to increase the project timeline for on the contract God thank you this is Kyle right yes thank you that's all do we have any concern on the uh the dilution test is that oh I I forgot to send that around but uh we're 4.03 okay I guess the one two five so we are it Cal will be bad that would we send it to the city council uh and again you we've got built into that I think it's 180 000 right now which is the current involved issue here in maybe 18 000 for the current storm water so once that burns off yeah that we're even stronger yeah yeah that's a good number that's great question any other questions thoughts no no is this an apartment here I'm delighted I I commend each of you for the hard work and bringing some good good results here I think it's bringing a level of business-like action to our Council which is is very much needed so very well done I I think I'm fully supportive of it I think there's something you do need to think about in terms of there's a there's a big resistance to any kind of debt and everybody thinks that this city should run out of its pocketbook and um I think being prepared for those arguments and and being able to show how professionally run Enterprise could operate will be helpful I'd also like to think about prioritization of the project in that someone did mention flooding some of our streets flood regularly that's another benefit to this project in that climate changes are difficult right now we don't know when there's going to be the next big storm and to get better capacity for dealing with the volume sooner is certainly a much better thing for the entire city and it's a core function that a city should provide so again I'm very supportive this I think it's a great move I would ask that that they consider the flooding priorities because some of our state streets do flood regularly I live on 9th Street it's one that regularly floods it's the core entry into this lovely facility here it's where our city park is I would certainly one I think it would be wonderful if that were a higher priority in the total project good well done gentlemen thanks for your comments appreciate it I appreciate the prepare for the no debt argument it's always a challenge but yeah leveraging is always a good thing I mean exactly which is what you're doing here right and I think the numbers don't lie it should do it any other way would put us at risk quite frankly from a capital I mean both financially and and of course experience I mean that we listened to the citizens when they said what is your number one fear or number one thing you want the city to take care of and what's the most important so that was really it that's all we heard from everybody so the master plan that was developed some time ago is that the plan that will be putting in place to use a prioritization and all of that stuff yes they'll be wrapping up the master plan that was updated in 2017. all right and so the whole thing to your point is is not going to take more than a couple years to knock out great I had my fingers crossed that the city council buys into what we've done here and especially what you have done with your background because I'm going to say this personally we were tasked with the city manager search and we made our recommendations and then we as a committee in my opinion got blindsided it's like all the work we did was for null because they totally did something else and an old nautical term dragging anchor and dragging anchor and a Drew this thing out when the candidate was right here yes it's unfortunate but that's I know that's what happens when you have people that are not experienced in hiring firing and interviewing and asking the appropriate questions and looking at the background and doing the checking and I understand that you know it's it's like clenching your teeth going I had that experience in my second career who wants to retired from the Navy when I had it to a point when I became a senior NCO so I know where we're coming from on that but it's very frustrating when you do so much and you literally get figuratively get blindsided I was really upset I didn't give a finance background I mean uh I do building my recommendation of uh recommended city council we go with uh the South State bot proposal to finance the projects that we you laid out with Kyle uh are you guys gay with us submitting it to city council for their discussion to review yeah yeah he's making that emotion I'll second it okay I'll make an emotion okay all right motion to go with loan from South State for storm water up to the 2.12 billion point one two Mill for sure okay a nice second that's right all in favor all right okay is there any other business to discuss cows or anything that is coming up on our plane no that's a workshop to borrow right the side ordinances on that yes at what point they were talking they wanted us to look at it too but it's been beaten up we've seen it that's another one yeah I don't either that was a mess and I did this proposal if there's any way that I can help if there's anybody that I can talk to or if you need to show some more support I'll be glad to do whatever you know that that can only help talking to you know the residents that you're friendly with and saying hey we've got a great thing going now and so what we get out of the city council legit does yes and after we present it'll open up for Citizens comments after we present it that would be a great time to and the more people you could bring in to have citizens comments to support if there were 10 or 15 people that wanted to speak and they did I think I think it may well influence the council absolutely that's good do you have any idea when this is going to come up you said April first to save the rate it has to be the first meeting in April which would be the first Monday in April okay we won't get it to a workshop but I just need to yeah I'll be traveling I need to look at that date okay well you can't if you're not here you can go up down to zoom because I just sit down all right with no other business uh trying to get I moved to adjourn so second second Mark okay all in favor all right 6-0 all right"
