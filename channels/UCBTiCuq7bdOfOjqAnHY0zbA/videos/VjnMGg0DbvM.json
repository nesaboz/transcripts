waste waste collection services and recycling um so I'm asking approval to award this this uh proposal to waste probe of uh Waste Pro Florida Incorporated official name and um I've included the contracts that they reviewed by the City attorney and I also included the evaluation committee dates she that come together thank you Mr Mr would you uh you like to add any comments to that Mr Mayor I don't have okay thank you very much uh before we continue I would like to give the citizens the opportunity to speak on this matter would anyone like to speak how you doing uh my name is Ian Bo I'm Governor affairs manager for Waste Connections I have a handout can I bring that up to everybody I'm sorry was that I have a handout can I bring that up uh yes you okay sir I'm going to ask you to limit your your speech to 3 minutes prac all day it's about 3 minutes and 15 seconds I think I think we can we can do that if not my my colleague Bill K can jump off once again my name is Ian Bo I'm govern Affairs manager Waste Connections of Florida 11500 43rd Street North I'm here tonight to speak about the RFP 20231 and ask the council to consider moving the RFP contract back back to the evaluation committee for further review I'm aware there is a vote tonight to confirm a contract with wasbo please now add no issue with wasbo they're a good company with good people in pel's County um as I Was preparing my thoughts for tonight's meeting I look back on discussions and examples for my colleagues in the industry first is my director of Municipal Affairs Kurt seac when I first started this job in 2009 in being in this business he advised me always be strong straightforward truthful about your information it might not always be well received but it's important to be honest please know that is the way I live my life but I understood what he meant when it came to our industry this being said I can honestly say when it comes to this RFP the city was fortunate to have the three best hauling companies in Canalis County submit bits in the in the end you want to work with one of them Waste Management has been in the industry the longest and have a large Municipal contracts in the county waste connections has been in the county for a long time as well and we have the most Beach contracts I'm more than happy if you'd like to call anyone in South Passad on St P Beach Readington Shores Readington Beach Indian Shores Indian Rock Beach or B air Shores anyone there will talk about our service or partnership or whatever was for is relatively new in the municipal contracts and penelas but by all accounts they are doing a good job but I honest to say the city missed the golden opportunity to save money for its residents as it stands right now based on my C calculations that the city goes all 15 years of the contract with extensions with wastepro the residents will pay over half a million dollars more in total overpayments for this service the document that was handed out is based on a 2.5% CPI and based on that percentage the residents will pay over 610,000 more for this service the other colleagues I looked at for examples in a situation like this were actually Keith andx senior vice president for wasbo Bill Jones vice president for wasbo and Ed farmer director of government Affairs for Waste growth in 2016 South Pasadena was going to vote on a new Solid Waste contract for Waste Connections via bit process Mr benac asked the board to send the bid back to the evaluation committee to re-review recycling services to the coms the board agreed and the issue was discussed the city did its due diligence and the com question was answered in the end the board felt better about making the final vote just recently last month Mr Jones and Mr fmer asked the city commission La Bell Florida to reevaluate the evaluation committee's results due to confusion in of the RFP and some other issues debate was eventually canceled and it was rebid in the end due to Mr Jones and Mr Farmer's efforts both Waste Pro and waste connection sharpened their pencils and lowered their price prices of had new bid processing it was a lot of work for the two haulers but in the end the city won with a better price and a fortified knowledge that they did their due diligence and would securing their vote for Waste conne uh for Waste Connections in closing I feel the same as way Pro did in South Pasadena and LEL the board should send the RFP back to the evaluation committee and ask a simple question why are we spending so much more for the same service and what do we get for the extra $600,000 you should be able to negotiate a better price if in the end you stay with the pricing submitted by way Pro and feel overpayment is warranted then you can be secure in knowing you did your due diligence and and move forward with the contract thank you for your time and we wish the city and staff and all the best and whatever decision they made thank you Mr Bo thank you would any other citizens like to speak on this matter okay I see we have no others uh citizen comments are now closed before we continue I'm going to make a motion to move forward with this R anyone like to make a motion so moov all right motion made by lyd Roberts do I have a second second second by Les Mr Roberts you have the floor I had a conversation uh today with our city manager and it went extremely well I had a few questions uh he provided me with the answers I'm comfortable that the time excuse me that the city manager and the City attorney has spent working on this and and minor changes that were made to uh provide our citizens with a very good waste management company I realized that the was a little bit more than um the perent came in second I think our city manager has already in a workshop this morning a couple of times explained the difference not always and I've been involved with many when you go out with a uh request for proposal that costing is the lowest B of the winner there's other features that are evaluated and in this case I think our did a good job of taking those into consideration which feel that's the best Mr Roberts would other council members like to comment or ask questions yes Mr Banker well I agree with Mr Roberts uh I'm all for responsible Contracting you should have that the language like a lot of states do but um I'm concerned and a lot of my residents are concerned that we're going to be getting rid of a great company Waste Management they've never given us a problem um just this past storm a whole dryway was loaded with building materials we shouldn't been pied up in my opinion but waste magic pulled up with their truck and if there was 20 bags there was 75 bags garbage filled up a whole trucke of back that all said the gentleman that got up and spoke tonight he's raised some real concerned with me if we're going to change if we're going to change the great company I'm worried about the same service that we're going to get from the next company and I'm being told that we're going to have identical service I believe waste connection was given us identical service too so why are we spending $34,000 more year that's that's my concern maybe this should go back and be red other council members I have a question Mr reer if we did send it back what would happen to our service to our current service yes so we extended our Waste Management um contract they offered to extend it to the end of the calendar year but it would go up um and it was in the agenda item it would go up more than it is this month for the following two months November and December were extended it's at the same rate that they proposed in their RFB so it's a little higher and um let's go back to our original discussion whenever we were we were debating over these three companies what in your opinion what was the major difference between uh waste connection and waste well the evaluation committee members read through all these proposals over the weekend because our time and I I to back behind the and um I brought to the meeting a scorecard um um that you know where I kind of either gave each company a one if they satisfied that criteria and I don't have the RFP in front of me but um I did include my scorecard that I reviewed with the valuation Committee in the meeting and um if they did they got a zero if they didn't um meet the criteria and I kind of just made notes and went through the whole H explain my reasoning to the to the committee members and um some of the reasons if you look at between uh Waste Connections and Waste Pro um that that initial tab one um it it had to do with um addressing and um and proposing their you know their services to the city um to meet our needs and you know I made I made a common Waste Connection addressed uh to Mr O and that was uh on the cover letter they instead put to my name and they put maybe somebody they they proposed to and um that jumped out of me because that's kind of like a pling for a job if you're going to you're going to write letters and you should probably H the name correct so I thought that was kind of a big deal um I since talk to Ian um and he and he told me he had some issues going on and you know it was a mistake but again um when you're looking at proposals and you're considering um switching from a very very uh well-liked company with Waste Management I'm looking at it pretty closely um for how much effort is put into these proposals and um I made another note here was Pro um the transition plan and that that was another thing when I read through when I read through Waste Connections Waste Management they both had transition plans and they they explained roughly what you know what the what their procedure be to switch out um Services I mean Waste Management didn't really have to change it the incumbent but with Waste Pro it it jumped out at me because they they had they really mapped out the city and I talked about things that they already started doing to to make this transition and it it was night day difference to me and when I explained it to the other two committee members they saw the same way it gave me confidence in the fact that you know they're already considered they already taking steps to make transition and it showed that they cared to offer the same level of service or even better than Waste Management so that I scored in higher and um Waste Connections and that was number seven they got a chew in that and they got that because they earned it they have a lower price but when I when I evaluated these proposals not just for the price um it came out to me that waste prob was going to offer uh you know they weren't the highest price they weren't the lowest price but I felt was confident and that they were going to provide us a better price than our incumbent but also give us the confidence in that they would provide good service to our residents all right Council any other questions or comments Mr B wow so we got a nine and 11 and the majority of this council is going to hire city manager that addressed the counc members wrong in resume so I'd have to give them another I'd have to bump them up to a 10 then so now I'm at a 10 and 11 since names and address really aren't important to this Council um $34,000 year or is this down set $150 $117,000 away contract this really needs to be Reed at last chance for comments all right well paty we need to take this to a vote uh this is for authorization to award RFP 20231 for uh residential single family and multif family residential solid waste and recycl and collection services to Waste Pro would you please call council member Banker no council member Chester yes council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts yes mayor gatis yes 5 to1 Mr reer you are authorized to um to award this RSP to waste thank you may would anyone like to make a motion to motion made by Frank Banker like to second second all right all in favor I oppos all right we're adjourned"
