    "transcript": "hi everyone it's um 3 30 on wednesday december 9th and i'd love to follow the meeting to order okay general here vice chair for hotel i'm here uh absent is kelly devlin nicole sussman alternate board members deborah keith here and nora koda um okay so we also need to approve the november 4th 202 minutes do i have a everyone in favor of me [Music] anyway so actually um we don't really need to address it today but moving forward if everybody's okay with it like last time i know there was um a lady here that i didn't recognize and i didn't know her name until afterwards and she wanted to say something but it was kind of at the end of everything else that we were talking about so like moving forward if everybody's okay with it if there's citizen comments or something that somebody wants to say i'm going to move it to the beginning so they don't have to sit through all of them if they don't want is everybody okay with that okay and while um like i don't think three minutes i don't want to like cut somebody off at the knees at three minutes like throwing a timer but i also don't think it's beneficial to let them go like on for four to five minutes later and and then we don't start anything until you know 4 30. so we might do something in the middle of everybody's there today everybody's in favor blue okay are you good with it no i'm not going to cut them off at three minutes if you guys want to talk about like how long we want to give them i guess it just depends on what the issue is is everybody okay with that though okay so the next time we'll just move it um in the next meetings minutes we'll move that up to item number three like citizen comments and then we'll limit it to three minutes unless it's the present issue that they need to talk about okay so what i'd recommend somebody put that out as a motion and we'll go ahead and vote on it just so we have it documented okay so do you want to make the motions that you brought it up the motion is to allow citizens at present to speak at the beginning the meeting for every period of time if you want to define it you can define it but okay so i'd like to make a motion to move citizen comments to the beginning of the agenda after the um approval of the current agenda the past agenda i'd like to move it to basically item number okay so the motion passes and lastly do we have an agenda i didn't see an agenda for today's because the first thing is to prove the agenda for today and then she only made two copies so i was like i printed out what she emailed us okay then i'll share it we do need to make a motion to accept it so okay so someone like to make an emotion to accept today's agenda okay so item number three on our agenda is the presentation of the park surveys and suggested improvements um that we would give to city council members and i'm hoping like you can go in any order if someone wants to volunteer to go first or i could go first it doesn't matter can we go would it be okay if we went in order that i put it on the uh because it'll be easier for me to take notes absolutely so which would put me up first shock south park and second street so um i went by those three and quite frankly i've never even noticed those parks before um having lived here for 10 years but using the word mark might be a little bit of a stretch they're just basically small lots um no amenities other than one bench at each park they're all very nicely maintained by our ground screws and maintenance crews i don't know how much use they got you know i went by three times i can remember i never saw anybody there so but they're very attractive again maintenance has done a great job and i can't think of any additions that we would want to make there or anything we would want to add i don't think it needs another bench i think probably people that are jogging just kind of pass through there stretch out a little bit and move on so i don't know see i even want to consider selling them i don't know how much they're used lin can you add to that i mean yeah they're basically pass-throughs every once in a while or something someone will go out there and sit on a bench maybe go fishing that's that's mainly what most of the counterparts are so i don't have any suggestions for improvements so we're not going to knock sea walls down and put kodak we're not going to go to kayak access or anything like that the one question i would have is on the second street park there are a number of pvc i wouldn't call them pylons our little straight up pvc pipe so what are those for manatee oh okay prevention from the pipe all right is there a drain pipe there is that why okay all right so i don't have any recommendations for improvement they're all very nicely maintained okay i i can just add to that a little only because like i'm only one house in from the south park so like literally if i'm sitting on my back if i'm on my dock or in my backyard i can see and because there's no like you know thing blocking the vision i know how much that part was used very you know and like during cove but it got used a lot when the park across the street was gated and locked that part was full constantly with people working out with people fishing um so and then people do they ride their bikes they sit there and fish they sit there under a tree it does get used uh enough to where if i lived right next door to it it would bother you because it's used that much so it does um the only suggestions i would make just because i'm literally in those two parks all the time with my dog is um you know recycle you know every er no one's going to say i'm not for the environment and i don't want to recycle but there's no recycle bins and there's also no doggy which like there's a poo in the park a lot which if well you know that people don't do that um for the second street park i know dev can seem to afford me because she stares into that one but like that one like it has the bench and it's got the pier where the south park doesn't have here so we can go out um people fish on it all the time but there's no water so there's like one of those stations where you can like clean a fish so it's bloody and a lot and people leave fish that's there and there's no way for them to rinse it and i know like you probably can't have water there i don't know why that was put there when it's really loud with the bucket and then [Music] there riding their bikes up there or reading or whatever but like there's always blood all over that dot or that because people are fishing and then they're not doing the bucket on the string thing and i don't want to say something and so you're going to think i'm disagreeing but you know i'm out there every day too and most of the people that fish there do have a bucket and they do bring it up with wash balls there have been um some people you know we have a lot of people that come there are not even beach they park at the at you know at the 1st street and 2nd street they park at the indian rocks playground or the park right in front you know and i mean we have a lot of lovely lovely families together but occasionally you get people that you know leave the things there um but i don't know how to put plumbing in the park that would be huge no i'm not suggesting that like i don't i mean i don't even know if you need a sign i just maybe i don't go to that as much as you do but like i've seen it a handful of times but i you know i'm usually more into a substrate part every day you know yeah but it's just a thought i don't want to like suggest that we do water or whatever but um i thought we could talk about it they are both all maintained and they're nice buttons that your crew does amazing oh yeah they do and like i know like one time one of the the coverings was broken and you guys were out there right away to fix that so i made the proposal is yeah and those are not that expensive so that's nice and those aren't the because i know like in indian rocks beach they have the wooded ones that are rotting and people just shove like old publix bags in them and they don't look very nice and they're falling apart so it looks like the ones that he is on the list aren't that so that's great all right so i told you just make sure i understand that are we asking the city to put a sign asking them to clean people to clean up after themselves is that [Music] officially asking them to do that are we considering that there's an entrance sign there warning about coyotes that looks like it's an open door lock that you can easily just slip in the form there too just as a quick fix that's true and just update that piece of paper and then that would be more yeah i would just i'm just not a big fan of sign signs everywhere your signs i mean if if people are going to let their dogs poop it doesn't matter whether there's a sign that says don't let your dog's poopy or not i mean so i might suggest we ask the city to consider that maybe we you know we want to spend any money on but it becomes a real problem if you know those who are seeing it on a regular basis then is that what we're saying that on a regular basis there's dog poop and there's okay so okay that is in i don't care where you go you know they did a study on that sixty percent of the people don't pick up afterwards well yeah i didn't realize it was that high but yeah no i walked at least twice a day and people allow their dogs to poo on the sidewalk i know it's just a bridge in your own yeah so would we be better served by maybe just simpler when we do this bell or b city update which we do i guess as needed just a general reminder to the public to clean up after themselves at the access and if you it just seems some kind of you know telling adults okay if you clean a fish to clean up after yourself maybe a general reminder to everybody i mean i'm not i'm not directing here i'm just wondering if we might try that before we spend any money and our kyle's time and people's time printing up new signs and putting them up for something that should be self obvious what do we think is all what do we want to do i think i'll just write him up his recommendations i'll put that down as a recommendation and that's probably going to apply to all the parts some some have those blue signs sometimes tammy i think i am okay so i surveyed the marina morgan park and seventh street park so i did the marina and morgan park on november 24th and i know like things can change especially as far as like you know maintenance or whatever but so for i'll start with martin represents the top notice the general condition of the park was fair too good um it looked nice it was you know clean there was no garbage or anything anywhere there's tons of garbage cans there i didn't really see any recycling the bathrooms are clean the roof of the structures both of the bathroom and the little tent thing or whatever you want to call it gazebo looked pretty new i don't know when those were put out of the roof look really nice um the landscape was okay it's kind of like a combo of rocks and mulch and so where the rocks are it looks like there were some new like little landscaping plants planted recently they're all about the same size they look really nice but up by the sign i have pictures of all this it's like mulch and then half of it is like all the dirt where the mulch blew away so i didn't know like one of my suggestions would be that like it was just the little river rock the pebble stuff that's by the street if we could do that by the morgan park sign because most of it the mulch is gone and i mean if you just want to re-launch it because it's less expensive and you could do that like you know once a year like people do for their yards i'm not sure you could have done it the following weekend i just surveyed the day i was there so um and that was one thing that i saw um the parking lot is in decent shape um there's some cracks and stuff like that but it's not terrible like you're not like following the cobbles or anything like that the handicap slots are really easy to read but there's a couple of slots for compact cars where like the paint showing where this compact is kind of like faded off i don't know if we really are worried about that um in the bathrooms like while they were clean the bathrooms while they were clean and toilet paper and soap which is all the important things like i would say they would need a little tlc so they don't get worse there's rust and the bathroom floors are all scuffed up i have pictures of this that i will email to patty and then she can kind of put all of our recaps together and then picture she can scan yours or however she wants to do it but the floors are all scraped up and there's like where like the water is running down there's rust on the outside of the building and a sink um the mirror is pretty much i mean it doesn't really need to be there because you can't see yourself in it it's i'm sure it's got to be made out of material that can't break so um but i don't know how far we let that go before we like do we let the sink fall off like rust off or maybe just you know do we try to keep up with it i'm not sure the last time you needed this stuff and then um that was pretty much it but overall it's really nice there's nice signs like the little walkways nice like even though it's like public access it's very clean and welcome so it's just like other than the rust it's just a little bit of like maintenance to you know help beautify our city um the marina surveyed on the same day the general condition was i would say okay to fair um it didn't seem [Music] extremely clear that there's public parking there i know there's like a little thing i don't know if we're not trying to advertise that or if i missed it i don't know how much money we make off of that park in the month do you know i'm just curious uh normally it's about six or seven thousand dollars a year last year last year because of covet it was i think it ended up 30 000. yeah and really that was good when the beaches were closed the parking lot had never had a bunch of parking in it usually it's a couple cars here and there [Music] but after coven there were no parking spaces for probably a month uh which you know it's just unusual it's just what it was and it gets dramatically dropped back off now could you tell if there was a lot of turnover people were staying for a long amount of time like by the parking meter like three cabins well now uh we changed the parking meter to they have to buy it three hours at a time so you you can't tell if they're three hours or they're coming back and put three more hours in nothing you know because it's not regulated like that but it's making them come back to the vehicle right so people definitely know it's their value because 6 to 30 is awesome well it's it's going not that copic was awesome no it's going back the other way now it's going back to what it used to be i mean uh last couple weeks weekends it's you know it's been two or three cars in there you know and and we are using it currently as a staging area for the boulevard underground and beach access yeah so i guess i mentioned that too but it's um i wasn't sure about that um um it looks like the marina rental spots are well kept um the slip numbers look like the paint's all chipped and i don't know the last time those were put on but like huge sections of them are missing you can still tell it's a four but it's like huge chunks of the glue is missing you may not care about that though the gate is in good shape the lights look great um as we've talked about there's no bathrooms there's very few garbage cans no recycling um very little like landscaping and ellen and i talked about the parking lot like it's because it's a staging i know they've probably done some damage but like it's rough driving apart through it like it's getting out on both x's it's like there's a four inch drop and i have pictures of all of this but it's just you know i don't know what we mean obviously we can make recommendations i don't know what we can do or well the part of the problem is you can't pay but uh unless you put stormwater upon in the middle [Music] [Music] yeah see that's why they've left it as it is because if you right now it's considered gravel i guess even though it's what it is it's millings from you know a road project and they put them in there and actually we're going to put a few more of them in there because we've got some from 7th street right yeah so but we're not going to spread those until they're down but yeah if if they wanted to pay but like out here we'd have to create a storm war upon no it's it's just the requirement of the you know the southwest water management to get a permit to do that but so when the they move all the equipment and all of the materials out there will be something to make we try to level it out we're gonna put what millings we got we're gonna spread them and try to smooth it out a little bit but yeah the city's looked at that for many many years you know and we actually have a design with the stormwater pond right in the middle of it wow this you all seem to be okay did you walk down there the sea walls well i tried to get in i don't have the keys so like all i could literally do is go up to the fence and kind of stick my nose through but yeah it seemed like it was okay there was nobody really there that i could even like ask but you know there was nobody other vote or there was somebody that was detailing the boat that they were working so so i didn't really get to go down like you know see if the sea walls were solid that would have to be you know yeah there's nothing wrong with those sea ones and then like you know that day you know it's also hold on either side of the entrance which most of it just kind of runs right into the you know the exit going out and then palm trees that really needed to be trimmed that day but they could be done already i don't know so it's just a matter of it could be timing yeah you said the palm tree i'm sorry the font crews got true yeah i figured because it looked like they were just it was like ready to be done um so really other than that like i know that the parking lot is a big deal um huge project that would be the only thing that i would suggest on those would be just a little bit of cleanup at the you know beginning because those are where the big craters are for your car like if you're gonna fill in right into two exits and then just a little bit of love on the landscape green just so it looks nice off of the gulf boulevard because it just you know and then 7th street park as i mentioned i went november 24th and december 3rd and it was under complete construction both times and the first time i could barely get down the road in my car so i felt bad for the people and then the next time i walked and um you know it's just all ripped out equipment so i'm sure it's gonna look very nice when it's done it's and just that's a stormwater project for 7th street and then the county's going to do some more work on the pump station so we're going to be tearing up even the pulp garage is that like a six month project no it's a 120 days so it'll be done into march maybe sooner did anybody have anything they wanted to add like you know like their like viewer didn't need to go here that you could go here all the time so seventh street like second second the seventh point second is just a small lot seventh is the one with the program right it is a small lot like the other two but it's a the boat great seemed to be in decent shape you couldn't get down there you could you couldn't even get those huge pieces of equipment okay and it's all ripped out and from the road i mean it was a total construction it would be dangerous for me too well just just fyi we're we're we've got a savings account to redo the the ram just so uh like twelve thousand dollars a year aside to redo that yeah it was um it was not possible okay then the next one says key but i think is that does that mean okay okay my head 25th and that was the first time i've ever been to both of them and they were just beautifully maintained um i would i would add nothing they had the bench and the little dog area there were two lovely plaques for the people that donated the area and then something to normalize someone else they do have the dog food uh which i want one of them next to my house but i thought they were just really momenting and the only thing you know once again it's like much goes on at different times and some of it wasn't you know they i thought they were one would change okay and can you speak in your mind my hearing is not that good i can't hear you so there's sea wall at 20th street and it's at grass level of ground level and you know so small kids together it's like you have to take care of your dog and take care of your child and there were people in the park next to me all the time you know often playing doing different things like i don't know right okay so i don't have a problem either way guys kind of have to share [Music] [Music] i really like 16th street i've been there many many times it's wide open it's always maintained very very beautifully um i went through it and kind of nitpicked it just to document it the flight table where they do fish it's kind of cut up i don't think it's a big deal i think it's going to hold up in that many years when it's there the seawall it has some cracks on it and it also has this exposed um it's like on your yeah i'm showing pictures once they start cracking and showing that kind of rust it means that water's getting into it and they're starting to deteriorate so it's something to keep an eye on and on the north end corner and next to that pink house the half of the block is just cut off do i think it's a big deal i don't know honestly i don't know if it's compromising the rest i think it's just something to keep your eye on um i don't know how much it costs just to patch that up a little bit or if it's a fuel to do something to look into on the pathway there is i took a picture with my foot on there um it's not that big of a hole just somebody could trip on it if it's easy to throw a little concrete on there to avoid anyone falling there i think it's an easy fix a patchwork um other than that i love that part and it's always always almost 18. [Music] um i have not been there before this is my first time it's one of the smaller little lots i don't know how much it's used because there's a lot of lots around it that are a lot larger and wider i see more people gathering there but again i'm not in that area often um that seawall has a whole host of problems um i've been cracking the whole entire way through again i'm not an expert i have no idea but i did a five-minute google search and it kind of shows that it's starting to deteriorate i don't know how many years it has on it or if it's something that can just kind of be wrapped again with concrete or perhaps we've been done i'm not quite sure the bench there has a little bit of algae growing on it i think that a scrubber a power wash would be useful um oh something important what was that this yep that was my important um i saw this little hole and i go what kind of creatures coming in here this is so strange with the shells it's not it's a little tiny sinkhole which i also googled is a sign of the sea wall water coming in and pulling down so it that is a potential hazard for anyone's walking there and when we're done to beautiful you can have more seashells because those are missing as well um the house next to it i believe i put the address on there um it is i'm not sure where they are or where bella beach's property line is and that house is it's very different than the picture on the website um their fence i believe it's theirs it's starting to lean over there's a lot of palms that are kind of overgrowing and pushing it there's a papaya tree pushing it down they put a fence or a gate there in the middle of their fence so i'm assuming they're using it as an extension um it was left open i don't know it's unsightly i think it would be worth looking into where our property line is and putting up our own fence it would drastically change it because i think by looking at that backyard it's going to be unkept for quite some time and it's not that large of a priority and i think it's going to start to shift and fall over over time the growth of the bombs pushing it um again i don't know how much this part is used and visited but this one seemed to be pretty um just just a little dingy seemed a little bit left behind and certainly worried about that so we wanted that little sample i took pictures of it i wrote down what i kind [Music] yeah you know it's one of those um compressed with plastic kind of material so that will hold up for a very very very long time just needs to be scrubbed down i think i'll look brand new with the little scrub nothing's broken on it it doesn't need to be replaced i think it just needs a little cleaning but on the bottom of the priority list these pictures are great thank you and then this is just like the landscaping years that they need shells it just could use shells i'm wondering if they purposely kind of scooped them out because i would imagine a lawnmower going anywhere near that would be a problem so it might be that they do not want to replenish that with shells and they just want to leave it maybe apply more grass maybe put mulch or whatever is friendly it's really not that big of a deal again i was in it before i was there so yeah just little ways it would look a little bit nicer oh these are great thank you what are your pictures george no picture all right i had across crosstown park and city hall in parts and across from um i don't know what to say about it the spring costly landscape it always looks good i've never seen anybody eat it because there's nothing to do with it well on the sidewalk duke says i've never seen anybody on the bench either oh i see people on them we so i have i remember what its purpose was other than to see what someone had donated or something or impressed enough to make you look nice so i i can't see any reason to change anything unless you um one time you talked about your sign for lavish would that be [Music] um but it looks nice and it was clear personally i think it's in really good shape i don't know the condition of the tennis boards but i think they're just so people out there playing panels um and i think you're resurfacing yeah that we're getting ready to review the whole tennis court take new fencing news resurfacing and uh pickleball i was trying to okay well i mean that looks it's a non-tennis player it looks great just driving by it i think you know we're doing all this work a lot better the playground [Music] is not the greatest but it's functional and i think people use it a lot of kids it's [Music] no i didn't say anything do you know how old it is uh probably playground equipment it's probably 17 or 18 years old we we have a grant application that c console opted not to take it to redo that whole part that's about right because people in the house about 17 almost 17 years ago it was being done right yeah it was somewhere in that so um no danger i think it looks very functional it's an asset to the city i think that's a nice there are no facilities for that walk apart the facilities that's the only thing that when i think of tennis courts and playground and are people aren't allowed to use the facilities in here anywhere they are between nine and four people now mostly the people who walk the bridge that's that's that's it yeah well george you know better than anybody because you've been on this you know that training's kind of left the station with the grant that got disapproved by the city council so if we want to revisit some part of that maybe like i know and for our employees here from the safety site and the general cleveland essay you know maybe well that's just it's very controversial the whole idea of putting facilities out here because it invites the public in and we don't want our facilities to be used really by the public we want them to be for ourselves so you want to have a family picnic over here and you have no access to no facility so i don't know if that's something we want to revisit later or not because we had an opportunity for 400 000 and with a matching grant or 200 with a matching grant but as you know that didn't go through no and i i'm not suggesting that i'm just suggesting that the facility's part of it i mean i don't think there wasn't the other world you know i mean we have the service in morgan and this is a much bigger part right here several different types of activities available recreational so it's worth it just think about that secretary i might suggest maybe you put that on for the next agenda of the meeting maybe we would want to bring that up um i think i'm gonna discuss it with lynn and kyle first because they may have strong feelings about how they'd like to see that or not but i think if i i tend to agree with i'd like to see something done in the area facilities and then with residents could have keys or whatever but you know we might want to discuss that in one later date by chance do you remember like the breakdown of that like where the facilities were included in the bigger picture that got turned down was it like 20 000 50 000 uh to to buy the restroom similar to what's at morgan that's probably today somewhere around 50. and then you've got a because they bring it on a truck instead of down but you gotta you know make sure you've got the water in the sewer and all of that's right outside right here off the patio and that's where we were going to put the restroom so it cost us a great deal of money to do that but yeah that those come in that are all self-contained yeah they bring them in a truck set them on the one at morgan's on a gravel bed you know okay so forgive me for not knowing but so like next steps if we wanted to revisit that what would we do like like obviously you know the pricing you had like the groundwork laid out would it be something that like we presented to city council at a meeting later when we try to find the money somewhere we have to put it in the budget but i think more maybe more specifically in the interest of time too we put it on next meetings agenda because there are a lot there's the maintenance component the cleaning component all the added costs that come along with that not to mention you're going to find probably some pushback from some some people about again that that's going to drop and i'm not for against it i'm kind of neutral because i understand the pushback very very clearly because that's going to bring people over here now you know then they're going to stay all day because no kind of the bellaire shore mentality don't give them umbrellas they won't stay very long a lot initially well same thing here we don't have restroom facilities the building closes at 4 o'clock people won't stay in the evening so remind me about that what did you ask lynn and kyle what your thoughts are because you thought about this a lot longer well when when they did the initial master plan for this park which was probably four or five years ago the city council at the time and uh you know they thought let's upgrade this one and what kyle did and we kind of went through the actually that was kyle's first uh grant application of course i've done many of them but kyle put it together and we took the master plan that was provided and came up with a plan that picks apart so you know if you're going to do improvements to the park yeah it probably needs facilities uh and the other thing that i kind of look at is okay you don't have facilities what what really happens out here you know kyle can tell you yeah and i can tell you uh whether you have facilities or not people are going to find a place to use facilities i've seen it and so you know the public's here let's you know the realization is the public is here look at the amount of people that come across this bridge back and forth back and forth back and forth uh it was really got to the point in city hall for a while that the owner the majority of the people that walked in the building were the people that use the restroom there and you know when we closed it for cobia of course it stopped and but it's coming back and you know we're we're even i i will tell you that we're looking at locking the doors to send it off because you know they come in and do different things in the bathroom you had a girl we had a girl and it was working for a resident just to give you an example she's coming over here taking a bath every day right in the restroom we have that at publix that happens at publix yeah yeah so you know but but that's the nature if you have facilities you know morgan park is a good example you know you can't control what people do when they lock the door and go in the bathroom uh that's that's just what they do in different it's the whole nature of everything we have a lot of moments in the area uh i we've been pretty good about you know we get the deputies right kind of run them off you know we'll give them to indian rocks beach that's better for us i've had them sleeping on the bench next to my house yeah i'm using the bush looking in my yard using it as a um yeah they yeah it it's unfortunate uh but you know i would say in a park that's you know got a reasonable amount of things you you probably need those facilities because would you rather have them do it the ramp coming up the city hall or right here or you know i'd rather have to go in the restroom and even for residents i mean city hall closes at 4 or 4 30. if they're playing tennis or they're doing whatever and they have to go are they going to drive home and that's like people that live here that like no they're not going home this definitely needs more discussion and it sounds like you know and i think that it would be a good idea so um we can just table that and move it to next meetings agenda can i ask about the playground equipment what are you feeling so does that even really need to be replaced well we had a plan to replace that too and actually we had money to replace the playground that we took out because it was damaged but the city council that was two years ago opted they didn't want to replace they didn't want to spend the money because we went out and actually got little prices for it actually you were on the part of work at that time but we you know uh this isn't a priority and i'll be honest it's not a priority but so right now in the city the priority is from war i'm getting my storm water bill i'm good okay um the next is um kelly's and she when she said she would say i asked her to email me her surveys so this is what i got she just said i was assigned to check out 6th 12th and belle ottawa park all the locations look good and well maintained and no recommendations at this time um i had the 19th street beach access which i've never been to and i thought it looked really great um it has obviously parking a clear walkway benches shower trash cans um had the wide open thing space with the pavers and then like the flat sand to get on the beach which i thought was like really great because i'm going to like go through the piles to hot mess um the only like improvement which is not like immediate it's just like wearing tears like the parking spots like the lines are starting to like go away and then um like the curves are kind of just like i don't know if they're repeated but they're just like not painted anymore but it's totally fine it's not like i mean it's just kind of like for looks um but it was like great the walkway is like really clean and plenty of benches so really nice and um might be a really good spot for like a bike rack because there was like the one spot on the left that like you can put one but nothing at this time and then bayside park which is like a really big park i never seen it before either and that has like the swing bench the benches the bike rack um this small like wooden like bridge to get onto the beach so there's like a small beach axis there the half bath um basketball court dog station for waist swings for kids slides rockwell the pavilion over the seating area and then that observation dog that i think that is workout equipment trash cans parking spots sand area easy access to the tennis courts and obviously city hall no like immediate improvements um i think that doc is for observation but there's literally like trees and plants and i can't see anything but i don't know if that's how it's supposed to be but maybe that's a change coming up because i did survey yesterday and then one thing because it almost like tripped was like the tree roots i don't know if there's anything that can be done with that but they were coming up um but nothing like crazy so i think it's a great place and like really great access to the bridge so and speaking on the whole like families thing like the restrooms i don't really know what the ratio is for families like living in our town like for our sorry not the russians like the park like the jungle gym i don't really know how much i get to use because i don't know how many kids live in bellair beach or in the surrounding areas but that'd probably be something we want to weigh out before spending money to replace all that if it's not broken or a safety hazard do we have 101 kids wasn't one born well we were 99 now we have 100 what is it it's a very low yeah okay great so i i want to thank everybody for doing this i know it was you know eye-opening it was nice and yeah i mean i plan on going to more like listening to you guys give the descriptions because i didn't get to go to all of them i've been able to have so i'm going to make sure that i go to the rest of them but it was nice hearing everybody's suggestions and compliments and you know we obviously live in a beautiful area and it's nice that we have so many things available to um and everybody's on top of what i know so it was like you know okay one thing are you getting ready to sign out sign up for the meeting no okay so does anybody have anything else they want to add i don't really think i think rick will type up the recommendations and then like i said i will email like my recap sheet and my pictures i didn't print them out i put them on my computer which it wasn't i didn't really think it would be appropriate to pass it on to everybody so i'm just going to send them to patty and then she'll send them out to you so you can see and i kind of the way i did mine was like you know three on an email three on an email that went together with each point so it'd be pretty easy to line up because pictures go with what but other than that like we'll just um get the the observations and recommendations typed up and then see what we can do for next steps like what's easy what's important for what can be done and what's so big that we've gotta we'll definitely move the bathroom and all of that to the next meetings agenda so is everybody good with that okay great um i just wanted to say that i went to the marina for the first time um after the last meeting i had to go check it out because it was painted as this dilapidated like marina that has no you know amenities whatsoever and i was very very surprised on how beautiful it actually was mine is the parking lot but you outside of the parking lot i thought the marine and the dock looked really beautiful i thought everything worked i mean it was a changing planet's but still you know like i thought it was nice i don't know why it was kind of addressed as something that hasn't been like taken care of now uh residents had to pave their own way and this is that but it was really well maintained i really kind of wanted to find out how much would it be to pave that road probably roughly it didn't be in the hundred thousands or more right yeah because you've got to do it you know the design of courses many many years ago so that would have to be updated but i i think you know based on what you heard basically for the first time the the point was trying to be made that uh we don't need to raise rates we don't need to do this we don't need to do that because i got to pay for my own boat lift and there are some marinas that uh do the same thing we do for a small community we don't have the capability to maintain somebody's boat so i i think what was kind of the direction of all that uh it was it was a cost issue that someone was trying to approach because i will tell you that and and we've discussed that marina in the rates for the last probably three years every year somebody comes up says you know we need to raise the reins of the marina and every year uh you know and mr lust did a lot of research trying to compare us which you can't compare you know the the marina that's at clearwater beach is a completely different marina operation so there is no comparison but as i said last month at the meeting my point was that we had not raised the prices in 14 years and at some point you got to raise the prices you don't really go to 14 years without raising prices thank you huh i agree yeah 14 years ago where the can of soup cost 75 cents and now it costs a dollar you know so the city council did pass the marina rates on monday and they will go into effect on april 1st so you don't have to worry about it now because because we graduated it we did you know what was proposed and so it's it's good it's good that's off the radar and bill's not here we only got a letter [Music] i didn't even receive it really you know it's loose usage of the word marina anyway it's really just the doctors so you know i mean marina there's full-service marines partial service i mean you call yourself a marine age you at least sell fuel you know fuel full service means you have some type of food and ice and things like that so um it's just a nice name for a wonderful community but it's really not an arena no it's it's shopping yeah so yeah that's nothing he wanted me to email him and both emails he gave me got shot back to me so he was supposed to be here today but something came up so that's all it says yeah okay are we good are we ready to move on to item number four okay perfect um so item number four we're not going to spend a ton of time on it unless um something wants to but the beller's going to be about our city donation program details i'm totally up for a new name on that but kyle did some research for us just to get it started um off of the conversation discussion we had last meeting so he did some research and maybe talked to some vendors that they dealt with and some of the things that we had listed he picked up pricing together so say just for example kelly who has a you know dog walking cleaning business she's like oh i would love to do the dog bag dispensers so she would like say maybe she does two and then she pays it's a donation to the city the city will order and stop me if i'm doing this if i have this out of order but um she would write a check to the city which would be tax deductible and then they would order the doggy feedback dispensers and install them and then somewhere on there it would be like donated by kelly's dog walking surgeons just like the benches right outside exactly so the garden club like so the benches that say city of bellar beach the garden club donated the same way but they just kind of did it of their own volition so i thought like maybe i've seen i did research on like just you know cities donate to your city and like people have great little just short blurbs on their website that say would you like to make you know a tax deductible donation here are some suggestions of things that we need and something might pop out a bit someone is it's got not going to be pushy or anything like that but this would just give a general idea of some of the things and i would love to open it up for discussion if there's any i think it's a great idea i think local businesses would really enjoy putting their name onto something so i think the plaque is a must to be recognized and it's something that can be you know a time frame on there so that you can always regenerate money from the upkeep of it as well um i'm for it for any type of art with a little bit of black even as a memorial anything you know copper that locks guys just for a long time you know right the only thing i thought of is like okay obviously the plaque is going to cost money do we build the cost of the plaque into this number like i don't want to pay for them but like it's it's built so it's built into it okay i was just scared the plaque doesn't cost that much though it's productive right [Music] it is a donation to the city tax deductible we're not have a 501 c 30 or a foundation paying money to the i didn't think they were tax deductible well a business can do that now okay i don't i wouldn't say a person that's right no it's not tax deductible it's a person in the past there was a there's got to be a civic association which debbie might be the only thing lynn of course would remember and they had a 501c3 some donations to it were that were tax deductible and we have talked about that in the last couple years about getting a 501 c3 for this exact reason so um maybe that's something that needs to be looked at because if a resident wants to do it they might not care about a large deduction but um right well the research because i asked my accountant and then i just did some research online so maybe like the cities that i looked at where it said your donation as a citizen was tax deductible maybe they had this and it just didn't spell it out would we be able to get this because i would definitely want to before we would put anything out there well it would be up to the city council some cities have that that's you know they have it other cities it's separate individuals that do it but you know you know i could have that discussion you know maybe at a work session based on your recommendation just ask that question i think it'd be important i think it'd be a big draw for residents to donate and we did it for our people it's not that difficult it's beneficial it's uh because other places i've been we we had our own so it's not and unfortunately the bel air was called civic dissociation civic association yeah yeah it it people moved and it kind of went the phone yeah the actual only surviving member not surviving the only member of that i know is debbie mall and she still actually has money in that account that bellarvi said and then the question for the council will also be do they want to deal with that money or they want a separate 501 you know so there's another account that we don't have a treasurer but our accounting our accounting service would have to account for that money and has to be kept separate too right yeah because because a foundation set up they have their own board of directors and it's set up that way so but some cities set it up and then the console is the ones that appoint them it's not crucial to this conversation for us as a board i think you know probably need to take that out to the next meeting and do a little bit of research and find out exactly what would be involved because clearly we need council's approval to do anything like that right yeah this isn't a slow mo like so this is just conversation we're still doing research so that would be great um do we just put it on the notes that we're requesting that and then okay does anybody have anything else to add i guess i think this is an awesome idea i mean we'd be surprised how many people would are able to and would be willing to contribute to things like this and then the city wouldn't have to worry about it or it certainly wouldn't have to come out of their budget you can do a lot with a thousand dollars here so i think it's a great idea thank you so much they can still build me directly to the city if they don't want the yeah they don't need they can't anybody can donate yeah i mean the garden club they don't have the benches what i'm saying is if they just want to donate they're not concerned about a tax write-off if they just want to donate something to the city they can do that they don't have to open up this site it's very inviting not to have that though it's most people do care about that tax right now and it's nice to have it if they do i mean do you have a lot of people donating to the city right now just now typically over the years the civic association did stuff and but that's been gosh 17 years ago maybe yeah a long time yeah and uh of course the garden club does they they do something pretty much every year you know they give us something like the benches uh they've donated all kinds of things over the years to the city do you know if they have a 501 c3 garden club i don't know what repair reach out to them situation find out because if they do there might be a way you can partner without having to read about the wheel because our interests and goals would be similar i would think okay um and thank you again kyle for throwing all this stuff up it helps because it's it's actually way more approachable and affordable than like stuff except for maybe the wikibon okay so item number five is the 2021 activity calendar so i literally just kind of brainstormed and threw down things and i threw down things that i didn't even know that we already had so and i tried to like put things on that covered multiple ages like multiple like like activity level or whatever but then i left some boxes so i guess like right now if we could like just brainstorm and add and then maybe we can go and see where we want to start and like i think maybe we should start small like we have to be building friendly first quarter we have to obviously like no one wants to go down right now it's cold or you know it's even kind of cold to walk the bridge right now depending on the weather so we're going to be like weather mindful and um like i didn't know we had a garden club i didn't know we already had a bridge club i did know that we had yoga i know that she canceled you know she's two days a week like one class i'm not sure what her class is lynn kind of went through it and explained to me like how it works as far as um like the city charges the instructor 25 of the proceeds to be able to use the facilities and they have to have liability insurance and then we kind of went through just on the phone i was asking you questions on how it worked like what activities would need liability insurance and what activities would just be like maybe a you know small group walk in the bridge and going to get a cup of coffee and obviously you don't need liability insurance for that um so i was able just from business parts that i have or things that i see like you know for the paint and wine class like they do it on the beach at sunset like he's called me back the the gentleman that you worked with in the past that did the stand-up paddleboard class that you know we took and my neighbors took that aren't here like i talked to him they have had work classes they have eco tours on kayaks like they have different things we can't really visit any of that until like maybe march or april just because it's too cold but like it's kind of like a you know where you're doing research and like you're putting together like a calendar like i think the bridge club meets on mondays at one o'clock yeah and then wednesday friday is yoga so we already have one of these it's already going it's just like i'm thinking that a lot of people don't really know what's on it and the people that have been in the bridge club have probably been in the bridge club forever and like maybe they invited their neighbors to join or whatever just never made it down to martin or whatever um may not be interested in bridge at all but i just thought if we kind of looked at the list and like maybe if we all came up with the solid maybe five to ten things that we wanted to start with and start slow and then we could depending on our interest do the research and say you know how much do you cause follows like say for example i walked down um indian rocks beach and this lady was doing yoga on the beach and like so i looked up her website you know reach over all the way down they mainly focus on tourists because they charge twenty dollars a class i i am not paying twenty dollars class to go to maybe once to try it but it's like it's something that you're trying to do for like normal activity like this is my workout every week i'm gonna go to yoga monday wednesday friday like those prices aren't affordable like i kind of want to do things that like i think the lady now charges ten dollars a class and honestly i looked up the insurance it's two dollars a week like they're not paying a lot of money for insurance like that kind of put me off but it's not expensive and um but it does say if you're a local call and we'll give you breaks so like the 20 bucks is you know for a one-time shot that you're doing just because you're in touch with me so just like there's a lot of research um we're not allowed i mean they were easy phone calls to just kind of see and we really can't put a calendar together until we see availability um like it kind of talked about a book club like lynn's like well no one's here after four but you know we maybe schedule someone to come open the building if it's cold and you can't sit outside but otherwise you can sit outside and you don't need to get in the building but a bathroom would be nice to watch if here for my club and whatever so like i'm not going to read the list like that i put together again anything on here could be crossed off with a big red x and we could put 10 more things i was just kind of you know my brain was going blood so does anybody like i don't know if you read it when she sent it to you it was partially filled out last time [Music] i probably have like one two three four five like seven things where i personally know instructors i've already taken the class or done the activity or you know i have the pricing but i didn't know if there's any like thing that like ricky may look at and go no absolutely not we don't want that here or dad you may go hey how about this because i've been wanting to use it for a long time you have to start small and i think i would love to bring the community together it's a very good idea well and the reason i think too we have to start small because as um they've been talking about like i've only been here for three years but like i i only knew about the yoga and i knew about the stand-up category because it was on the sign so once we get a sign and i know there's going to be like a a survey sent out then is there any way that we can maybe because it was suggested on monday at the meeting that like we maybe ask the community like if there are things that not just this group wants but if like there's something that they're looking for can we get that included in that survey like maybe three or four questions the survey that's going it's not a survey it's it's a a letter we put it on the website already we've got i think 104 back and uh we're gonna mail to everyone else after the first of january well that's what i'm saying like i did the survey online but could we put like the three questions in that mailer well this this is mainly to get a list to build for things like surveys right we're talking kind of two separate things okay i mean we're gonna we did a uh we had a constant contact thing but we're finding that very few of the names on it were even residents i think right now out of the 470 people that are on that list we got 82 people that were on the previous list so that's telling you yeah that right they weren't our residents right and so what we're trying to do is get that set up and then we'll have a way to to do surveys but that's going to go out in january to the to the public because that was developed by the communications committee like what's a reasonable number to start with like say for the month of january do you want to start with two and see if we i mean the only way we can really generate interest we talked about maybe putting an extra neighbor like obviously word of mouth um we could post it like if somebody comes in to the building and sees it because i'm assuming the sign won't be done for a while no it's it's kind of going back and forth right so like i'm not counting on the sign for the first quarter to be honest so it's like um maybe we should just start with like one or three things on top of the things that are already on there cheryl the current yoga instructor is um i have a call out to her she's going to call me back i'm going to see when she's going to restart what type of yoga she teaches because she's already established she already knows what the needs are she already knows she has the insurance she's got her following of like different people and you know i haven't been in my yoga studio since cobia like so like it's people are looking for things to do even if it's like sunny and beautiful and she could do it um i think maybe because so many people are working from home now but never did [Music] it's an option where we might be able to get her a bigger class or if she's willing to add a few more classes of different types of things i don't know what she does but i'll ask her when i did you have you taken your classmates i have taken many yoga classes and that's a killer i think it's a rough time to start these group activities i would love love to see them i'd love to see our jewelry making you know that's something that or an eight-year-old can do along with chess you know um if we're ever doing that workout there i would love to have a giant chess board um we go to dessert often and they have i'm telling you kids and grandparents playing against each other it's just something that's for everyone and it's pretty easy to maintain yes will somebody steal some of the pegs every now and again for sure i fit with them that's why you make them so heavy you can't move they make it really heavy it's fine but you you know you can put an outdoor shed lock them up as i see somebody here you know i've come by here a lot there's always somebody maintaining it so you know as they're locking up with the tennis boards or just do they lock them up at night the tennis courts it's the same time that you just throw them in the bin or whatnot i think right now is a good time for the charity run walk outside to social media something that can be easily done um outdoor movie night little cold but i think it's just a hard time to start this [Music] and i did mention that when i gave her her report on monday that like the first quarter we would focus on covid compliant activity so like i'm not starting any yoga classes indoors i just lynn said she may be starting back up again soon she may not i'll find out when she calls me but anything first quarter will probably be more like the walking the bridge the charity run that's what i thought like maybe we can discuss like which ones we thought like maybe do five and then we i've never done that i'm just saying that's something you can do outside okay so this is [Music] um i would love to see the paddle boarding and kayaking and things of that sort but that's a big that's a big asking to have an apron now i have a company and i have pricing and i have everything and he's worked with him before he literally brings his trailer of stuff he knows the program he does kayaks paddleboards he used to be in tarpon's rooms he moved to clearwater his yoga instructors do yoga on the beach like he's got all that do this with the city funding it so more people would come we can't we talked about that not monster city employee because i was the same thing i would like to do free activities or something that's affordable um like so i'm trying and as i'm talking to these people like i'm trying like if it's under 10 bucks it's affordable like the paint and wine thing or whatever that's on the beach that they do that's 45 bucks but it's three hours he gives you the chair the canvas the paints you know the easel it's self-contained here's your whole thing for three hours and then you bring your own food in whatever you want to drink i that's a little pricey but it's i don't think it's out of line for a three-hour activity and you would do that what once every you know no one's doing it every week um and that one i didn't think was bad but that's the whole thing right now to finding like either free things things that are coveted friendly outside or things that are affordable and people will be like it's not just gonna be one and done because it's too expensive and um so this is great like um like if has we ever done a charity run in the range no they they come through here a lot but yeah it's very close down the bridge can we close down the bridge you won't get to close down the bridge but you can get a permit to go across it and like one plane they've done that you know there's there's groups uh but you might be surprised at the logistics and the cost [Music] i see it tons of bikers going up and down north boulevard right you know it's scary actually i think closing streets did you guys talk about this run yeah we did and it was a huge it was going to be a huge project you're right there are a lot of pieces that you never think about till you try to put them together yeah i i i was the chairman of one in old mart rotary yeah and you know we have 700 runners probably and uh it's a lot of work a lot more than you can imagine because of the logistics and people just don't want to they want to run and get a little medallion or trophy and a lot of them use them for time because they run in other races and they use it for qualifying or whatever it is it's got to be official time and you know there's so it's it's not anything that's uh you know you've got to spend some time on it you need to advertise you got to have insurance and you got to have sheriff's deputies it's it's a lot more logistical support there's also a lot of demands a lot of time too you start putting these things together you find out where there's an awful lot to it but that's a separate thing from getting word out and saying hey anyone interested in running the bridge come out meet your neighbors we're basically going for a community job then you can work your way around all that but you know what what i might suggest for consideration is set a date for a january meeting and try to do it early in january and we each come back with a couple of things that we might want to do um to look at maybe do the first one the end of january and then look at february and march because you know to the point of communication getting the word out is what the city is trying to do and it's not a very good return yet and this has been a problems plagued us for a long time is how do we get the word out number one and number two make sure that we don't get the word out outside the bellar beach that's where a lot of i understand entirely that a lot of pushback came with events was bringing outsiders into the into our into our quiet city so and i don't i don't do social media i rarely ever go on it so i don't know if like next door um occasionally i look at it or i get a notification and it's from bel air shore or not bella shore but um excuse me bellar bluffs so i don't know if we have our own or next door includes a whole indian rocks area it's a lot of work to maintain if somebody has to kind of dedicate themselves it's just community driven and that's kind of next door everything kind of we could just do it by update because we know that's going how many people families does that go to when you do the bellar beach update is that still only going to maybe well based on it it's well you're talking about the news the news right okay and and we put that out every other month yeah and uh you know it it's i'm guessing it's getting to maybe 100 people right yeah out of 15 almost 60 um what about like a facebook page exactly private private facebook page like you give out communication to everyone and tell them about it and then it's their responsibility to join in and that would be private and then it would just even if it's something like i would have like if i needed to help like i would totally be willing to help with that but just to verify that people that we are accepting are bellar beach residents and that's what we're doing with this uh communication survey because for us to accept what they said back to us it's got to have a bel air beach address on it that we can verify our friends actually who lives there because we've we've got some even of the 100 few that they've got an address that we don't even have that street here so so you know they're they're just saying oh yeah i want to get your information but it's not the owners of the land no no it's people you know one that we we looked at recently was from cypress street i don't know that that's all it said cyprus i know you're a former mayor i think you would know there's no cyber stream so yeah so that's why we're with the communications committee goal was is to collect this database and you know because people say well i didn't know this or i didn't know that uh it is funny as it may seem a gentleman just called before i walked in this meeting from the undergrounding project that we did on bellevue estates island he's been paying an assessment for two years and didn't even know it he's selling his property and said well i didn't know anything about this well you paid i think he hits a naked lot so he's paying 1267 a year didn't even know it but he's selling his property and he came up on a assessment search so he called the city today like right at 3 30 and said why am i making this so i'm watching your reaction a little bit because i was i was the same way when i first became a part of this i was like we don't have a way of communicating with the city and i've learned predominantly from linda they've been working on this for years people are reluctant to give up their email addresses they certainly um don't want to be on social media unless they request to be on it and so this is unfortunately a real challenge to try to get the word out i think creating a facebook page was the way to go and announcing that on our board once we have one well we have a facebook page you have a facebook page it's not marketed that's part of what the communications committee but we're we're only going to push out information we're not going to receive information you can also direct mail everybody it's very easy to get lists and we know what we address and let people know that we have a facebook page but we need to be updating and putting things on there it's set up so when we update the copy when we update the website it will push it to facebook so anything we put on the website we'll go to this facebook page but it's it's a one-way communication for us because we don't want to get into the two-way communication because then it becomes a public director right i mean that's more worse than you know for government that that's part of the problem yeah it doesn't need to be you know to respond and return answers on there i so all of this stuff that you're talking about communications it's it's coming but the community just finished it and yeah we uh the the council basically said you know i suggested to them that we do the constant contact list and then wait till up first of january to do the mail for the balance because between thanksgiving christmas how much junk mail do you need that you may not even look at so with that said i think that it'd be so much fun to be at i think we just move on with it and we pick some some events we do them we talk to people about them and we get the word on we get the word out on the front side because this isn't going to get fixed anytime soon so i think we just start moving and people the word passes on us who are those guys kayaking down there you know what's going on we want to be a part of that so that would be my suggestion from january it's a direct mail that you're sending out in january to get the information isn't it yeah mail in each house we're gonna mail to anyone that hasn't already responded which right now we have a hundred people so it's it's gonna go to the balance of the property owners that's yeah we're to take the tax appraiser's uh mailing list so if you get your taxes okay so if everybody's good with it we are just going to table this to the next meeting if everybody could like maybe pick two or three things that they would like to kind of champion and like do the research on the cost and like the instructor or whatever and then just bring it back and present it at the next meeting and then hopefully by then we'll be able to get some things like out there that we can have people sign up for and even if we can't do like the charity run like rick suggested and it's really already on here like a couch to a 5k training like you know if you run here to pretty much the marina and back it's a 5k maybe a little bit more maybe four miles um but if you do like audible has a training program where you know it's just like you can be six feet apart and it's like you know you you run and you walk and you run you walk in you don't need any of the bells and whistles of the insurance it's just some friends getting together outside and trying to run into more miles um so does everybody go with that george you look like you have a question no i'm just a little i'm thinking yeah so everything that we're going to look at for first quarter is going to be covered friendly where we could be outside you can be socially distanced so nothing in the building it's either going to be like outside on the beach or on the sidewalk or where you can spread apart i think you've already said it for requirements [Music] even myself i'm trying to get my mind out of things that only i want or don't want to do like you know it'll be nice when we were able to ask like the general community what their interests are but like right now we're just we're going to kind of have to find things that are generally applicable so yeah everybody could just do two or three and then like bring back like the pricing and if you have an instructor or just what your favorite like what you would like to see on the activity calendar for the first like three or four months and then we'll just try to build it like we're not going to try to like do too much too fast it's too confusing we'll just see how it goes and like if we put something on there and nobody shows up for four weeks in a row or you know whatever then we take it off and we'll try something else so it's just going to kind of be like a you know we'll just see how it goes because there's really no way to gauge it otherwise um do we want to have a meeting in january the next meeting um you know how she likes to she asked me for two options to see what fits people so um it's either wednesday january 6 or wednesday january 13th and i was wondering if anybody would mind if i moved it up to 3 o'clock earlier earlier earlier is better is that everybody okay with three as opposed to 3 30. okay perfect so um she'll send that out and you can respond but either one of those wednesdays at 3 pm so then we're going to try to be out here okay so then um in in speaking to lynn about like these things um and lynn correct me um this was my understanding of it but that we can put up an activity calendar together and not have to go to council and get every yoga class of brief like this is what we do we don't have to have approval on a paid one class or whatever but we do have to get approval on events like we have to get approval on like so the outdoor movie night i should have put that on the next page because that is the event that's something that would be when it's warmer we've got to run equipment like that was just something i threw out there but like things that we tabled last year like we talked about like the christmas tree lighting like we already know you know december of 2021 we would want to like the christmas tree probably around december 4th or december six like depending so that kind of thing we would put on the calendar now and we could take to council and say these are maybe oh um and like the garage sale it's always in april and november and people generally like that and it's always been done so we would make sure that that's on the calendar and we had them approve that um like we kind of talked about lynn and i did and we could vote on it it was like a like a halloween dog costume parade where we would meet at here and kind of go up and down like that would be the kind of thing that we would have to all vote on and agree upon pick the date and then take the council and have them say yes that's true general it's not approved for the rubber museum and then the other one would be [Music] like just maybe a community picnic here at the grounds so because that could be covered friendly and that would be another thing that i would ask for everybody like if you were setting up your own picnic here and you had to be covered friendly and maybe not maybe the rules were kind of like loosened a little bit what would be your ideal way to do it like would you want like music music for sure yeah that's what i was thinking was like music being kind of friendly for everyone yeah exactly and then i thought too if we're still under like strict open restrictions then we're not trying to feed people because you have to have gloves and masks and everything has to be individually bagged and people all like different kinds of food so it's like everybody can pack their own picnic basket and refocus the funds on the music or maybe set up a beverage tent where it's bottled water bottled you know everything's we're not making pictures of lemonade and pouring it it's literally like there's a bottle here or whatever the case may be but it's like everybody could also bring back at the next meeting their ideas for what you think would go well at the beginning and if you like like music like say for example last weekend we went to turkey springs to this new um pretty old restaurant and they had new orleans jazz and they were amazing it was uplifting and the music was fun and we were there at 11 in the morning so it was kind of like a daytime thing so like it's on my notes to call and get their pricing for like say maybe a two-hour deal or something like how much would they charge to to come to bellar beach set up outside and play for our goodness and then we could go with the new orleans thing or you know like maybe have you know how like i've only been to new orleans once but the thing that stuck out to me were all the like artists on the street like doing those little caricatures like that might be fun for i mean i you know just anything like that so like think about kind of what you would like to see happen at the picnic we do have a budget to work with and i was thinking that this would be like something if it got approved that we would use that budget for yeah you have you set aside so and that would really be the only thing on here that costs money at this time um so again we're starting slow because i know you guys are old cat like this but like the rest of us are kind of newer at it and i would rather do five things really really well then trying to do 20 things and they all flop so it's like they want to focus and get the details down i'm with you on that and i think we should also focus on getting funded by the city though [Music] anything [Music] we did the picnic in april and may and it went great then we would like then go back and ask if we could if we had the money in the budget to do the october fest and do a different kind of beer and puzzle kind of thing i love your idea i love your new orleans jazz i feel like that would be does the letterwater do a jazz festival every year too i mean they have a much bigger lot and everything but yeah just popped my mind but i love the jazz idea i feel like that's a proud music okay so yeah no great and they were so good i was very impressed with them and honestly like this is a new restaurant i i don't think they're showing out big bugs for them i really really don't so um so i'll do a little bit more research on that if anybody thinks of anything else that they would think would be like great for it and we could if we do the um the garage sale in april i don't know like we could maybe do it in may then we're pretty much assured nicer it doesn't matter to me just if whatever you guys think we came back we could vote on it and then kind of get it and then present it to council and get just a couple things approved and then work on the calendar very slowly trying to incorporate it so well i think it was time that got canceled along with the others so but yeah no i think that's something that they're not people that have boats and we were looking into trying to find a captain to lead it that knows the waters at night getting in and out of these canals but yeah that's one certainly could be a lot of fun that's a good one yeah because we have to go to indian rocks or clear water right now or just watch it so and yeah i think that's a great idea like they do now new rocks beach so that would make it a little bit more difficult unless you're at like 16th street you can look out and see them come in and out of the canals but you know if you've ever been in rock's beach parade it's pretty big for a boat it's [Music] i mean so many well there's so much of the beaches waterfront and there's so many green space and parks for everyone to go to that is not i think that would be something really great to plan for next year and start trying to get us on i think the same night would be ideal to be honest but we can try to do a separate night i mean they've already decorated their quotes yeah no that's great you can do it anytime what about fireworks fourth of july it's a lot of money you have no idea how much fireworks cost and there's so many people around us that have fireworks i literally could just sit on the couch and watch like right across and like the water they have so much speech i know last year they didn't they because it's such a mess up in clearwater i can still see it makes me just to let you know 20-minute show yeah 15 000. we don't have those huh i'm on board really i mean did someone donate them the waste foam yeah the garbage is unbelievable like you need well the old smaller i had them on the pier yeah i'm talking about the beach oh yeah well indian rocks this year stopped all fireworks on their beaches they were going to wrestle they were going to arrest them if they did it they did it they did it they did it was pretty messy afterwards yeah it's messy for us too all right okay so is everybody good with that just kind of go through and you know if you have any questions you can um and then we can get some things done so item number six is just all other business and i believe i've won this is something when i went i went to all the parks and then i walked um one of the things that i argued about quickly already said it'd be too expensive and i had a couple of people say they would like place to create we have actually the fence dock if you put a kayak thing on any of that that was a suggestion i got from two different people on my walls and then the other thing too i think he talked to us about doing possibly doing something to the sidewalk the walkway through they used man the easement and i had all negative against [Music] the couple people that said it to me it made sense because you know how we walk bouldering every day and out there on that sidewalk we get the people with the motorcycles bikes the scooters all of that people going to work here that kind of thing and the number of people that always buy their houses and they were wondering what i was doing um and i said you know we're talking on the parks recreation and we're looking at possibly doing something here and no one they won't know no because it's like especially down in our area and the other thing that brought up to me i'll tell you about the bridge it's like a thoroughfare right you know this in the towns it and i'm telling you to get to that bridge it would be a nightmare and then i was thinking about except somebody walked yesterday when you go across the walkway is on the right side of the pond so anybody coming across that bridge would see that damp sidewall and make it throw thorough mercy there i totally answered and everybody that might not any positive reaction well there's there's a cost to it and that you know the council asked us to there's a couple council members that feel that you know those are emergency accesses uh the other concern is unfortunately people have planted trees in their yard and they've they've put what's ended up a tree root so or there's people that have put which we've talked to several men that have put their fence in the easement because you know what they did is they expanded their yard it's kind of like you know uh that's one house up there yeah i'll give you an example the second street park if you look at it the house on the left they thought it was their uh landing area one time to do whatever they wanted they were dredging and no the park is for you to go in here and tear it up and you know so uh but there is some concern you know that somebody can trip and fall because of tree roots or what have you and the other issue is you can't really go in there and put a bunch of dirt on top of it that's then what it does it's affecting the property owners so that that's what the theory was and you know i don't know how it came but you know because that was many many many long time before i was overlooking here those walking instruments were there we're talking about the walking eastenders between like second and ninth yeah yeah they're going to pavement no it's a discussion i don't know how far it'll go once the signs were up without the non-murderized things before that you'd have the people going through there and all that and it's not even so it doesn't really bother me so much it's people that i love um that the old neighbors that live along there and i mean it's great at their table on their porch well i don't think we need another walkway in town [Music] and i do i feel i love the waterfront homes because they have a wall with green growing over it and i feel very comfortable and i kind of do the you know of course blinders on so i'm not in some ways they have every right to put up a fence every right to put up some hedges and everything that they want um yeah most sections along that trail have a fence or shrubs or you know at this end of town there's a couple that uh they planted the arena ponds and well then people are not happy with that so we we got to reclaim our accesses and you know what whatever it ends up it's it's a costly adventure too the difference too this is lights back there will be as i walk through dark when we have more people in there at night i think we get a lot of people from indian rocks i think they walked out they come out of the finger there but the concern still is if someone trips on a tree root or falls or something because it's not a level path then guess who's responsible for that would be the city i screwed a couple of orange yeah yeah and one last thing i'd say is as we come up with these ideas if it involves resources money support particularly from kyle's staff before you get too excited about it might not be a bad idea to call lynn and then just ask him his opinion how the council might you know go or if you have a favorite council member call them and say hey i have an idea because we can't communicate but i have an idea how do you think the council would react to this and they might tell you don't even bother yeah just to kind of put it into perspective lynn knows he knows it all so he's always a good resource and say what do you think the council would because he'll tell you yeah probably not so the council hasn't voted to go move forward on this it's just kind of still in there though it's a discussion no no they they uh asked us to get some prices and we've done that but what what we talked about doing was when we do these stormwater projects because we've got the asphalt people there if they did do it would just add it onto the project so it wouldn't uh it wouldn't be as costly because you do one once a year a section does anybody have anything else to add to an amusement conversation [Music] does anybody have anything else they would like to discuss meeting will be like you mentioned wednesday january 6 or january 13th at 3 o'clock and she will send out an email to ask your questions um"
