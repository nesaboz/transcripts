is Pete Cordero I'm on 12th Street and um I wanted to address something in regards to the entrance to the 12th Street parking space and um I've noticed that the same build up on what you might say is a walkway going up by the pillars and on the area where the pavers are they should build up quite a bit and I wanted to have some input from you guys if you mind if I would clean the area up and maybe get some of that same off off of our concrete especially on the area where the steps are is encroaching into the forefoot area where uh if you go down to the car especially the young ones or the elderly folks having a hard time getting in and out of there and uh maybe that how do you feel about me um doing the work myself around the shower the grass is encroaching on the area it's very limited from what it used to be um and I would like your input on that thank you very much Mr rodero normally we do not respond near exists and comments however at the end of the meeting the happy respond or uh during city manager comments he may decide to comment on this topic also they say is this something you would handle he would take care of is there something he would handle yes sir so I

out maybe someone within the city would take you very well thank you next yes please stand up to us your name and address good evening everyone my name is Eileen sergiara I'd just like to introduce myself I live on 15th Street on September I was selected to represent Bel Air Beach for the Miss Florida USA pageant I'm very happy and excited to be the first to Ever represent you all and I will work hard to serve my community and Inspire others to do the same thank you so much thank you very much can you have any comments how you all doing this evening my name is Kat TJ luger114 Bellaire Beach 9th Street Maya comments are about the 7th Street boat ramp I just was over there the other afternoon done with some fish carcasses and I realized it was average time I looked at the ramp I walk out it's 150 deep at that water level at that time today I took photographs at average high tide for the day it was less than my knee deep it only extends nine feet out from the sea wall that's not enough to float a jet ski that's not definitely enough for an 18-foot skiff the old boat ramp always sucked at little water but for the mandatory for me you spent as a city eighty thousand dollars to cap over the sea wall and do some kind of ramp Improvement there still no dock it's not functional whatever that is is not a functional load ramp the ones over here go out 26 feet but when it ain't rocks at least 22 and a half feet an 18-foot boat trailer okay isn't 18 feet long that's about 20 foot of trailer it's a rule of thumb is your back tires your truck hit the water edge boat shop enough water to float this would not happen even on a high tide here I'm making myself known to the city I have photos if you'd like to see them I'm kind of pissed off because that seems like a waste of money you don't build something wrong you build it right now someone's got to go back there and fix this problem and where the rent stops it drops straight into the mud tonight at 4 30 in the morning overnight will be the dead low a serious low I bet you the whole thing will be out of the water I would like to know and let someone get back to me and see what's going to be done about this because a boat ramp needs to function like a boat ramp that's all I have thank you very much other comments yes ma'am please come right up your name and address hi my name is Nicole Sussman I live at 98 Harvard guy and I just wanted to talk tonight about the Bellaire Beach Community Foundation and just meet everyone aware of our brick program that we're starting um the Flyers are on the table out in the hallway and um anyone that purchases a brick will be located outside of City Hall and we'll make sure to like put all the bricks that people donate out there and this is just the order form so if you'd like to purchase one all the information is on the sheet um and then also I did want to talk about this new program that we're starting um it's adopt a mile program it's through keeping us beautiful and we're going to do a beach clean I'm not Beachwood I'm sorry Bridge cleanup which the first one will be on the it's going to be the third Saturday of every month and it'll be January 21st is the first one at 9 00 a.m and we'll meet here at City Hall to get started and after our first Bridge cleanup then we'll be able to get one of the signs on the bridge that we're part of so if you have any questions about that please ask anyone on the foundation board and we'll be happy to answer all of your questions thank you thank you any other comments from the system upstairs the key for online overdrive are also in the Parks and Rec board I just wanted to let everyone know about a couple of events that are going to be happening we're gonna have the second annual Health Wellness Fair on Saturday the 14th and it's going to be from 10 to 2 um and we can have a premier Healthcare Providers of providing screens information and give ways to help promote Health and Wellness in our community and also on January 19th we've been at a CPR class here at City Hall and you can call City Hall for more information thank you very much hi everyone I'm Tammy lebenda97 Harbor Drive I'm just here also to speak a little bit about the Community Foundation as it was brought up last Monday when we were selecting a new council member I just kind of wanted to give a state of the union and I don't really have anything to read but we started working on the foundation in March of this year so it took us like five months and there's four people right now on our board we are looking for a fifth person would be a vice chair um but up until this day our board has been financing all of the foundation so it's about two thousand dollars to get all of the paperwork through the IRS the State of Florida all of that so we do have lots of opportunities for donations or support on our website so if anybody is looking for like a last minute 2022 tax donation we would greatly appreciate it we are reaching out on a meeting set up with Duke Energy and waste management so we are seeking support through other areas but I'm more than positive that we are going to be successful we just need to get the word out but and we're more than happy to get it started we kind of knew that's what it would be um but I just as last Monday when he got up here and was like oh the foundation can do this and can do that like we're so in the beginning of what we're going to do like we're more than happy to take over whatever projects the city wants us to take over from the merchandise to you know the social events so those will be moved from the park and rec Court just because um it's easier to do some of the things through the foundation but until we get some Capital built up in our account we really can't do any of that so I just wanted to let everybody know that you know since March pretty much the board has been paying for everything so we would love your support if at all possible thank you thank you any other comments from the citizens McKnight thank you sir happy October report for Butler Beach to give you tonight but the first page of the report there is only two assaults reported during the month of October today the second page of the report there's a total of four people arrested for five separate offenses the month of October the third page the deputy activity reports there are 791 events since you get better each during the month of October with 896 you responding to those events and for the final page the correctional citations crashes during the month of October and there's a total of 209 combination citations thank you the question from the counselor yes sir Mr Roberts yeah I'm just curious what is the definition of a felony habitual traffic offender so that would be something along the lines of driving on a suspended license there's a couple different ways that you can reach that status but typically it's it's you have a suspended license what you get you get for live suspensions that you can get the technicians on and charge you with then the judge will go ahead and classify you as a visual traffic violator go down thank you any questions I was crossing the bridge this morning and saw that there was a sheriff's patrol car sitting in the median and apparently someone was coming down that Hill ride the boat ramp too fast how fast it was able to turn that car around and stop the speeder so a nice job on that I do have one question about the concealed carry firearm that feed maybe they pull the car over and there was a gun in the car yes sir uh that was actually Deputy Perez's case uh I believe in the beginning of the month of October he stopped a person and made a rush on a traffic offense and inside the car in the driver's seat and the center console of the car was a handgun that was not properly destroyed thank you any other questions or comments from the council thank you Sergeant appreciate it thank you clack a code enforcement report good evening Mr mayor council officials staff and citizens Deputy Cloud coach for the record uh if you saw in the blog that I submitted for the month of November uh still busy we're really going after a lot of these ordinance violations with the uh the brush and the bushes I'm getting a lot of compliance one of the things that you'll probably notice in there is usually we give a five-day notice but I've been giving everybody 15 or better because of the holidays and trying to get somebody out to take care of the issues out of these homes [Music] the it's been working out real well um I've complained or compiling a list for the city manager and let him see where actually where we've stopped um actually given the notices and when the when the jobs are done so we're hopefully we're in the right direction to start in January again um is I'm going to try to drop it back down to the five or ten day notices to kind of push the citizens to get this done but one of the complaints I get is trying to hire somebody um in maybe two or three days before they get a return phone call so I usually give them my business cards saying if you have any questions please feel free to give me a call or my email address and that's been working out well I've been getting some emails saying that people are getting work done or they've got something coming up to give the the estimates and get the work done so other than that that's about it I'll explain for any questions there was a vote that fell off of it yes are we doing anything about the dangling lift that's oh that's one of the things I didn't discussed with the city manager that we are going to get with him and tell him to get he needs to get that repaired because of the issue with that boat because it when it uh during the storm Nicole kind of went out into the intercoastal rusted up in in Sand Key and then thrifted down and we finally got it down off of Belle Isle and talking with the marine officer it's been a little bit of an issue trying to get that boat out of the water um I've been off for the last few days I don't know if it's still there or not but the Marine unit was taken care of it but yes we will address that yes yes baby I will tell you I have another house I'm Alita that we've been working on this for six months to get uh her her lift repair and it's it's an issue with supplies permits and everything else but we will do yeah it was partially submerged the last time I saw it but and I haven't heard from the Marine deputy and the weather has been pulled out of water thank you I have a question whenever someone does receive a quote and they're given a time away if they show you that quote the next time you come around and they can sort of reset the clock yes sir what I'll do is if somebody says hey they can't come out for another three weeks I understand you know and uh it would get a complaint on it then I'll address it with whoever it is the complaint and they just let them know the we're going to study because one of the issues we had was down on uh 103.7 and it took a while but we finally got that house cleaned up I have one more question what is silt that's right there the silk fences are the black fabric fences that go around a lot okay and technically if they're doing work there those fences have to be up to eliminate debris going out if the house or the lot is vacant and they're not doing any construction we can have them remove those until construction starts all right and do you um do you pay attention to the equations the drain guards what is their purpose is to prevent anything from going in it it's supposed to eliminate and the city manager backing up on this it's supposed to eliminate certain things going down into the sewer system such as rocks and those types of things so it's just supposed to filter water through it okay I don't know if this would be for you or for the city manager but since we're talking about soap fencing and sober I was around 12th and 13th Street I got a couple presidents were complaining about the new construction and there's no silt socks on any of those new drains that are going in there and you can actually see some of the debris already would that be a new assistant snoopies I don't know if that would be your jurisdiction or the receipt managers uh I can I'll take care of that I believe they started that whole system plugged okay but I'll check on that thank you all right we're up to item four which is BC attorneys report Mr Moore thank you mayor and Council uh first and foremost congratulations in your first meeting it was an exciting moment I uh I don't have anything major to report except to say that it has been a pleasure joining this body in the middle of the year and working through our first year together I commend the efforts we've taken to meaningfully Advanced policy in this in this our body in these Chambers and if there's anything as we go into the next year expect to see some of the issues we've discussed the administrative elements of the vessel of solution ordinance which Administration will handle the the sign code ordinance and other similar and also a legislative session that I'm sure will have plenty of fun surprises for us to adapt and so with that thank you for the opportunity to work for you to work with you and I look forward to the next year a counselor all right thank you very much I appreciate it and now we are on to item number five to city managers report we have a city manager everyone Mr riebler thank you mayor councilman um let's start off the 12th and 13th Street project that still has a January completion date but we'll most likely see more than 90 of completion in the next couple weeks they are they have all the pipe installed including the additional plant that we approved in the November meeting they have some sod driveway restoration to do after completing the amount of Valley curve but we're getting very close to kind of middle of the below the road and then lay the asphalt over a couple weeks so pretty close on that project the Gulf Boulevard undergrounding some good news there is the Duke agreement and invoices finalized for phase one but in the process we received additional credits and a total for both phase one phase two over about 440 100 000 of how many credits so phase one is credited in addition Al 162 000 that is good because the original cost was about 1.1 million now we're under a million if you remember when we did the presentation on the Gulf Boulevard and underground and we were talking about the deficit the project was in these credits in a sense the the Arco money the 800 2 000 is covering that additional that we underground product so it kind of brought us in good looking at the big they are still working on easements where they can give them if they cannot attain an easement then it's going the equipment's gonna be moved to the extra of the right away for the Savage street bow ramps out of the street you see well 16th Street Seawall the sea walls are complete the boat ramp is complete we I was being aware of this week of an issue with the boat ramp up engineer designed it with a wheel stop at the end of the ramp that has been proven to be it's going to be more of a problem for that ramp and the use of it based on the way the tide is in the previous ramps so we I already spoke to the engineer we're going to eliminate that that uh we'll stop and I will look into that drop off that was mentioned earlier in the system's comments we still have to get the fishing dock installed that maybe something that uh be taken care of while we're doing the dock installed um the same thing with 16th Street Seawall that is complete all the we need some backfill and the city staff will be doing the massage restoration with those projects the 70s and 18th Street the DMP stormwater Improvement project we have a meeting with this DAC are we further this discussion we have one concern uh involving both the stormwater fund and the capital projects fund as it relates to the loan uh chair of the CAC once again and I are planning to meet with uh with the bank tomorrow and to discuss with what the qualifications would be relating to those funds the code enforcement analysis we're moving forward with a quadrant plan that we presented um like like Steve mentioned earlier um we are focusing in on some of the the most important and uh most frequently seen items around that quadrant report and you're also tackling some of the frequently seen items that maybe it weren't as ranked as high but they are still um aesthetic codes that the city needs to go through routine to make sure people are within those goals so that's what we're at right now I've been logging the daily directives I've been given to Steve and we are performing reports to be able to report back to you the city hall generator last time I think was a meeting ago I I told you that the sourceful quote has gone up the councilman or Banker had recommended they're looking to be used generator option I did speak to the main company uh Generac that I was dealing with they said that they do have used options but the warranties they do not of those I did reach out to Kat and I'm trying to get more information on better used options foreign City Hall sea wall based on the current price per foot or well under budget so I think we need to hold on that project we've been experiencing some erosion out there but I think that it's not a thing that needs to be taken care of and tomorrow I think you have some time but that's something in the future of a platform go out to fit the office will be replacement we passed the ordinance um I got out of the FWC working through that whole permit process they've been extremely helpful I pretty much compiled their whole application and waiting for the necessary approval from the fdep and the US Army Corps of 18 years before I get seven minutes the application to make sure that I have everything the way they want it and I will record the boogies and plan on installing the Oregon Park parking lot restoration I brought this stuff because it's dinner budget we had to Mill and resurface the parking lot it's getting in rough shape over the years my plan is to have some estimates present to you in the January agenda um lock and easement survey that came back and we did very well a big thing to keep the Parks and Recreation board and put a lot of effort and just Distributing those surveys to over residents they went door-to-door got a lot more results than we would have any other needs and I forward those results out to you and I've also put them on the City website okay for the uh just for the citizens that are here would you give us a brief summary of that survey because they may not know what the outcome was if you haven't seen the results of the survey it was heavily weeded each uh to not move forward with the project of Paving the walking movement throughout the city it was about 80 to 20 percent uh thought that they were for the most part better uh better products to be spending that kind of money um but if you you can see the exact results if you go to the city website on the very front page it'll say well I can use the survey and it lays out all the uh the statistics for the three questions and then all the comments that were made and then children playground it's still uh we're still waiting for it to come in um I did get in touch with a huge playground uh company in the areas called to use children's playset so they might just uh you know a lot of us like they could remove the placement for us big enough our staff stands and um we'll take care of that that definition and USB to um to reach out to the property owner with the tree and uh Harbor Drive in East Street um I did get in touch with that probably when I took us a little bit to find his telephone number for the two other member for him he is agreeable not that he's going to pay to remove the street but he'd be agreeable to have a true Revolution so that's kind of early at this point um in the system comics we had the uh I mentioned about the sand and the 12th Street week to access something to look into as far as where the uh the CCC line is in uh we can move that sand back to kind of cover the paved scenarios and uh as far as the holidays coming up we have um the building will be closed for Christmas Eve Christmas holiday the New Year's New Year's holidays so another one will be closing on 12 23 to Friday 12 26 is a Monday at 12 30 it's a Friday and uh second of the New Year the normally our seat council meeting will be on that Monday so we need to come up with a new day for the January consultation Council a couple of things um the 12th Street beach access you said you're going to look into that there's three benches there um two of those benches or one of the bench is completely loses both its foundation or so often pulling it down the other one is three quarters of the way gone I mean I was out there a couple of citizens said they they would participate in volunteer and clean up area but if you remember Kyle the previous city manager had problems with the coats and everything like that and they said don't anybody touch anything until you know what I'm saying because the CPA got on this really bad on that so I mean sense that that occurrence occurred when that happened we've kind of backed off on the maintenance somewhat I haven't in touch with fdp since we moved some of the sand back at the 19th Street access because it was encroaching heavily and I've been working with them on what and what we cannot do and making sure they're completely in the loop so one I guess the question is citizens shouldn't be out there doing it until I would recommend that we have a city staff is three days ago and forward right is completely able to have to take care of that wheel stop issue because it presents more of a with such a low tide and a little water there you really need to daring like medium to low tide you know get a trailer well off of that ramp um the old ramp allowed for that because what happens is the slab they're going into itself and you can continue to pack um the engineer when they designed it put on that wheel side it was an oversight that Mr Luger helped made clear that it would present a problem I thought maybe you do here today and discussed the dot will be put back shortly the dock is approved tonight I will get that going as soon as possible thank you Council Jesse Roberts still on the 7th Street boat ramp so just make sure I understand so the old boat ramp extended out to distance packs so the new boat ramp does it extend x minus some footage or did it go to exactly the same point or further based on the comment of the citizen from what I could tell because when we we're measuring the old milligram I walked out there like I said the silver and sand had washed up probably about six feet off the edge of the sea wall so you could trace concrete to about six feet and then you'd start going down a couple inches into the sand and kind of feel more concrete we we estimated that 10 feet would give us a well out where eventually that that seven it would come back in um you know where I have to get out to where you would be on I guess the mud sand so um when they when they did the slab they had to judge the set of it back so there is it does drop off but that is something that may be able to be adjusted once we take that metal stuff off so that at least that ramp will get you down to where where the set of it is and then from there you're gonna have to take it as far as you can today in the boat with the trailer okay so that is something to take a look at with the engineering firm that perhaps it may be beneficial to go ahead and extend that thing further so that even when we have a low tide we're going to be able to have launch and not have an issue I will check on the engineers my it's my understanding that if we extend that that slab it's going to be buried so it's going to be buried by silt and yeah naturally for me right back into the tides okay so um to the trailer below the edge of that concrete because you're suggesting we will try to fill that point in yes so that you've got about a limb they've got a breath catching your wheels is The Edge higher than what it was before the engineer and the contractors told me that they had to remove the slab and then put it back and pour it back in it wasn't affected by the engineers so I trusted that's what happened foreign I'm just curious over over time the past how often has this particular building lost power intermittently a couple of hours inside that year during Irma they never lost power and maybe might have been down a couple hours but it could depending on the Storm sure sure I understand like with a generator what the Swift movement years and all of our buildings had backup generator support but at the same time I think with our budget we need to think through you know what we really need here and as long as as you're buying a used generator based on this Mr Banker's recommendation as long as we're exercising those generators you know on a consistent method like once a week once a month we used to do this all the time and so we wanted to make sure that it's operating correctly and so that when you need it that's when you need and we don't understand it so um I I guess from the infrequency that we've had any issues here it's hard to really justify the dollars for a brand new generator although somebody who supplies those will want to convince us otherwise so there's um there's multiple opportunities out there I believe to get a used generator that we can bring on board and as long as we're exercising it when we're supposed to and basically running it once a week to make sure that when we need it it's ready to roll I think that would be fine whether or not you know you can get it for such a low price I believe there's a lot of organizations that sometimes would just donate those you know like the state would you say hey we're done you guys want it you can have it so those are things to possibly pursue to see what we can come across just something to take a look at on that right and they'd still have to build it up to a 12-foot so elevated correct directions yeah so it's out of the water hey let's say at least 10 years I'll get the exactly um I took a lot of pictures of it um that I was going to present it to you just the condition of it we discussed it and um yeah yeah okay thank you anyone else but just like questions also the boat ramp thanks to that again I hate to keep bringing it it's not open right now is that correct okay and we're going to make sure that once it is open then it's hard around it's not something it's going to see the boat goes in there and they have to drag it out it's not coming out so I just want to make sure we're I know it's it's kind of a hassle to delay reopening the ramp that we want to make sure uh as far as the generator is concerned I had comment on that also write down a maintenance program if you have a good regular company who's taking care of it and it's in its generator it'll work fine we uh we use one in our company we've had to rely on it maybe twice in four years but it Cycles you get emails and changing the oil batteries things like that it's not cheap then we'll have a large generator like that but it's certainly cheaper than buying brand new so um I like the comment about the tree it'll be a nice conversation to have with the surrounding neighbors to see if they're in interested in maybe uh doing that and the last thing I was at the Florida Legal cities conference this weekend or actually last week and I found out that they have a grant assistance program are you aware of that yes okay and are we a member of it if we signed up and considered looking into what they have available to us I believe we are but I will double check because I completely okay it's my understanding that over half the municipalities of Florida are members of that grant program and uh they're supposed to be very well versed at directing you towards grants since you may not be aware of okay and they did [Music] there are some grants available we've got some occasionally so that's it for me Mr Baker I forgot to thank you uh it's probably your biggest pain in the butt I'll say but it's not always uh she's like the tree I really appreciate you looking at that taking care of it thank you any other comments from the counselor One More Mr Robert um first I want to thank you for the the long list of projects because that helps us understand everything that's going on so that's great there is one one thing that wasn't on the list and I don't know kind of like it would be something for you to address or for something for Randy or grass I know I received an email like I did read it I didn't probably spend a lot of time just delving into it but I know there was a religious group that was within our city and the end result was some type of a legal response from that organization could either lead to kind of give us just a quick recap regarding what happened sure um quick recap problem solving slightly more detailed recap uh there was a religious organization canvassing in your community door-to-door there is plenty of case law providing that for or religious organizations political organizations and the like sort of those bastions of free speech we often think of that campus in door-to-door is permitted without the need for a permit your code is in line with that constitutional case law and as well it may require permits for certain forms of solicitation that kind of canvassing is specifically carved out from a permit requirement of a somebody had approached some of the canvassers suggesting they may need a permit or they should check with City Hall to inquire about getting a permit that they in response to that that was what that organization's legal department sent a hey we're sure this was an oversight but please be advised there is legal Authority on that we've already conferred before that correspondence came through we did not know that that correspondence was coming but it was by the time we received it it was functionally moved in because the city never once took any action on that issue or specifically discourage or help them to get a permit so it's it was sort of a it was it ended up being a non-issue ultimately but it was it was resolved and just as a general matter whether it's members of the public the commission or otherwise if you're if there's ever a question or concern on what our codes allow or provide for and the person tasked with giving you folks that legal advice and whether and what we'll do about what our codes say is is Kyle's world so please bring those concerns to Kyle if there's a you know any concern about approaching someone saying hey I'm down there Beach we don't do that sort of thing whatever that sort of thing might be that's for Kyle deputy clacko and their team to to resolve but that was how that worked out so thank you subscriber uh yeah on that issue I think I respond to you Mr Moore and Kyle won the Watchtower case because right my previous work background non-profit we're going to say agents have a lot of leeway especially religious groups the way it comes to a religious wave or whatever not saying that this organization was trying to set you up set us up but there's a lot of organizations that are out there there are some that will uh this theirs was in response to a specific interaction they had by the time we received your correspondence the manager and I had already conferred on the issue and agreed no action would be taken thank you yeah I have a comment on that or a question actually I thought that they sent us a creative letter they were warning Us in advance before they ever arrived is that not the case that's not my understanding of the facts and my understanding of the facts was the letter was sent in response to an interaction they had they sent the sheriff Pinellas County Sheriff's sheriff and the sheriff forwarded and gone to all the U.S dollars and uh I appreciate everyone not responding to my accidental fat finger reply on [Music] but we did give you 10 commands is that it Council all right thank you very much commissioner doing a great job all

effect immediately upon adoption as a budget resolution this has been read in full uh on first reading and only reading resolution number 2022-11 thank you very much Mr Moore that was hardly a summary but hey we'll accept the entire resolution let's continue these citizens for comments as there are no comments from the citizens do I have a motion to approve resolution 2022-11 so motion Move Motion made by Mike Sable do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley uh Mike's able to do that before yes as you can see by the city manager report about the additional funds I recommend uh approval anyone else have a I guess a statement and that is the accountant didn't give us any backup information as to where those funds that were originally of the budget to fund this where are they going to be placed are they just going to be a limbo and so we decide what to do with them I know we talked about using them for undergrading like we should have them here reflected in this um so the way she had it but she had the alcohol funding was more on a uh unearned revenue and she's moving it she's dedicating into storm water and typically with the stormwater fund and the whenever the medial project we move the monies from there that are unassigned into that on the application pay for things so we're taking that money that was the unearned we're dedicating it to storm water and Community for accounting purposes because easier just spend the eight hundred two thousand so that in turn the money that we had to say had been budgeted for those projects that were going to pay this using this and this that money will be available um I give if we want to make a note about how we will it is offset because the idea would be that uh you know if you're putting the 800 or 2 000 in Minnesota wanted to pay for that project then it would create a money for capital projects and then the reasoning behind not applying it to underground I mean exactly because we have a lot of reimbursement through the county involved in that and it was going to make the accounting a lot a lot more complicated I understand and I think that we need to go on record to say that 802 000 is going to be used for undergrounding and nothing else and that's where I have a problem with it going in a general fund for this is a project we agreed to it all focus on doing both the phases of the project on some of these funds and some future Farms with the 443 000 that we have additional received from the guide to do some some adjustments that were made so I mean we're pretty close to having that project funded and I want to make sure that we have those funds dedicated whether through notation or some some advice there but we I don't know if the if we need to amend this but I I want something included agreement that That was supposed to be dead okay [Music] turning more of it into a resolution now I I was a little confused about this also but those are the mention of exhibit a and what we received as exhibit at 8 doesn't that lock it in I think we're making it for the storm water system yes you're dedicating the art but funds to stormwater because it that is a qualifying expense for those funds hey I'm not real sure about the clarification request so the um we have had eight hundred and two thousand dollars in the budget to pay for summer water now those funds are available for the future projects we talked about those funds being used specifically for the underground Boulevard we had a gap so I want to make sure that that's when we talk about that and that those funds don't get pushed to another project so should this actually this this Arc of funding has to go to the storm water system it's the money we've dedicated so there should actually be another line in this to make this where we're moving money from the storm water system to the undergrounding project my advice at this stage is I understand things that if I miss mischaracterize them please let me know my understanding is this resolution deals with the dedication of the Articles and I understand that the point council member or vice mayor Shirley is making is that okay but then what happens to the money that displaces where does that go if that needs to be addressed or if this Council would like to see that address that can be done by subsequent budget amendment a bunch of women can be done in January meeting if need be given that this word and all entity were not present this evening to resolve or address further inquiry as to how they're handling that on the books you can definitely make sure following the meeting that um manager riesler advises her that that Insight of the commission or the council has that hey we've always had the understanding of once this money came through or the money would be dedicated to this other purpose and we can further amend the budget to address the secondary purpose the primary purpose here is to make sure that we are signaling to any parties agencies or otherwise that hey we're complying we know the way that this money can be used and we're dedicating it that way what that does internally for our other monies we can resolve through additional resolution and the way we would address this is by some strange stance city manager briefly did not add this as a as an agenda item for a new resolution for next month's meeting one of us could certainly do it provided at a resolution is necessary I'm sort of assuming that there's there's abilities to move within funds so depending on if a resolution is necessary in the first place then we will have one if it's simply yes we've changed the Ledger because you can move within funds right we're not going to fix the dog park anymore we're going to fix the bocce ball park you can that's all parks and rec budget it's just how you're using so if those are within the same phone lines and I just don't have an encycloped he acknowledged the line items in your budget document to say what funds each thing resides in but if a budget equipment is necessary we can provide one and if one is necessary and that's not done we work at your pleasure other council members yeah I'm a little confused because this money is Kobe Bryant whatever it has to be specifically used for this storm order okay so if you put it in the way it's written and we're over funded of course you have through the Constitution you can amend the budget but if the attention is the movement right now I think that's fraud uh I I think that's a that that understanding is is more of a misunderstanding it's sort of the idea of if you have five dollars in your pocket and you say hey when my Dad gives me five bucks then I'm gonna go to the movies but that's what this is a federal allocation of Monument I mean I think if we would be kidding fraud I mean if Our intention right now is to move this money right into right into underground which is not that's that's not what this is doing this is this is moving it directly into the storm water fund we're right but what what was proposed was I believe the idea is we're going to take this money and then use it for underground no no and that's why I say it's misunderstanding the challenges you're dealing with fungible Goods money it's sort of a legal construct of which eight hundred thousand dollars we're talking about we're talking about these 800 000 will be used in one way and by virtue of this influx of 800 000 we can spend 800 000 another ways the point is surely vice mayor Shirley's making but that's that's a that's a topic for another night correct which is why which is what the advice ideas I think we're in agreement saying saying similar things to everyone but putting it on the record now I don't know where that stands I'm and I'm going to advise you that legally it stands that we are okay to adopt this resolution codify it's Ray as written and that's all we're not doing tonight I have a nice agree with that and then the persons whose job it is to make sure we stay within Financial compliance we'll analyze and advise the program thank you any other comments from the council mystery surely are you satisfied with uh all right let's uh take this to a book this is to approve resolution 2022-11 Patty would you please call the roller council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro

written proposals from the search and providers which I've done I'm going to provide those for you they recommended tax docs and seawalls of Florida they have been business with us before they've always offered competitive pricing and body work instead of moving forward after receiving those proposals I believe that is not only for being the lowest paid but also for they will provide good work

just for Kyle or for the city in general the storm sewer cover on Harrison is crumbling and if it breaks it could eventually be hazardous it's the one just over the bridge as you go into Harrison and I know I've asked in the past if we could look at lighting the bridge on Harrison Avenue because it's extremely dark and several times I've had to kind of jump out of the way of cars because I can't see pedestrians on the bridge so we can kind of look at that I think I actually called you about it and they never responded so I got them to do plenty other things on the street that's it thank you
