    "transcript": "it's five o'clock we'll call the tuesday may 10th citizen advisory committee meeting for city of bel air beach to order and uh first agenda business is to approve the agenda i'll move it be proof second all in favor aye aye any post okay uh the next item is approval of the march 8th city citizens advisory committee meeting minutes everybody have a chance to review any comments it's not can you get a motion absolutely second all favorite hi any opposed okay that motion passes and so now we'll move on to the review of uh city manager selection hiring process so i'll turn it over okay uh in your packet you've got a a draft outline with dates and times on it and you've got a copy of the job description this console went through you've also got a couple emails from that were sent in by council members uh roberts and vice mayor gunn with salary range and that was part of uh consulate asked uh lloyd to come up with the salary range and he came up with 85 to 110 and then the comment about ten percent and minimum yeah and then uh glenn had taken the florida league of cities just for some more information and uh they have a statistic that they collect every so often and it came in around the average of 95 and that's what this is so and that was using the uh tax collection report correct yeah average yeah yeah actually he had a couple different things but based on the number of residents total taxes collected right and then this is the task sheet and this is kind of just outlined of what the console's expecting and uh it's got the task on it and then the last sheet uh the mayor developed this and private console and they've left it and then this is a storage sheet and patty is going to be the one that's going to submit all this stuff to you once the all the applicants are in on the 23rd she will start compiling and she'll be sending a packet to you the date projected right now is on the 26th of may and you'll have with that resume any information that she's collected she's doing some google searches and stuff to add to their resumes then you'll have this form with the name on it of each candidate and each one of you will you know put your name on it of course and and rate each candidate's application based on and the mayor can explain this a little bit so that that's what this form will be for it will come with the resume and any other applicable information that she sends you and uh it's kind of a short window i'd like to get them back by the first digital patty and she said she can send you this she's going to send you a paper copy or you oh that kind of copy and if however you want to do it that's fine you can do it electronically and send it back and then after the sheets these sheets come back from you patty's going to compile a scoring sheet with all the scores on it your names are all above it and she'll compile this once you give everything back to her and then she'll be able to have you a total overall and it'll basically show the amount of points and the average there's 40 points in this scoring system and as an example the example she filled out here has got 35 33 34 28 30 you know just so i noticed that she assumes i'm the you the optimistic one and john is the uh pessimistic one absolutely must be she's got his figures she has no idea what my qualifications are it's just yeah i think lynn had his hand in this and he was picking on me i didn't have anything to do with the numbers so we just kind of worked out how we could yeah compile everything it's a great example so yeah i had her make an example and she'll put the scores back in so basically what will happen is there will be a final score sheet with for each candidate with this on it that uh when you meet or eighth of june you'll just verify that all the numbers are correct and you'll make a recommendation on the top five candidates i'll say but the mayor can talk more about that okay and that's really all that we wanted to get you in here for so you kind of understood the process and how patty's going to try to handle it either done as expediently as possible on top of her regular day job appreciate all the extra effort she has she's doing for this yeah does anybody have any issues with the dates i know that's over memorial day that's gonna be my only question it's it's over the memorial day weekend yeah i think anybody's going out of town i may be going uptown i'm not sure yet it's a 12 what's the day 20 thursday the 26th is the thursday before through memorial day and the first is the wednesday afternoon and how many do we have to review right now it's 24. whoo okay i mean this score sheet that i will say that the mayor came up with he just went down the job description you can explain today yeah it's it's uh really not going to be that hard i think but it's definitely a little more overwhelming because we're dealing with a budget at the same time so what we're trying to do is we're trying to free up some of our time and weed out the ones that obviously don't fit um we've got a salary range if they are way out of that range immediately they're disqualified i wouldn't even waste my time on are they putting the salary range we haven't seen any of them the council hasn't seen seen them yet uh i had one guy that emailed me directly saying please hire me but other than that i in fact i still haven't even seen his resume and his qualifications uh but um let me just run through right quick how this works and it's pretty straightforward so if you uh i had patty actually email you the spreadsheet that i created this with within that spreadsheet there's formulas anywhere where you see score one [Music] even though there's three different ways that you can score you're only going to pick one and score with that one so let's pick on educations to start out with if they have a ba in public administration they score a five move on if they but if if they have a be a business administration score of five and move on but they can't get both they can only get one and if they have something other than that you feel like is worthy of giving them credit you see there's a zero three five so the most they could get in that in that first section would be five points but it could be all the way it could be one two three four five or nine um and so we moved down to experience you've got the same deal it says score one so whether a city manager boom five okay maybe not a city manager but how about a system boom five something comparable now you do the zero three four five the reason why everyone is doing this individually is because i want to see how everyone interprets this i don't think it's reaching a consensus in this case is the best medicine for picking the best candidate everyone's going to rank the candidates differently based upon qualifications of how they interpret their qualifications so you've got the job description you've got our list of qualifications and you've got our salary requirements and you're going to read through that and they're going to write something that sounds close okay does it is it actually something in government finance one person may say yes i believe it is and one person may say no that's fine i don't expect all of you to agree on how you're going to score this but at the end of it all patti's going to take your score for each candidate and add them up and then whenever she's finished and we've got them all we're going to rank them highest to lowest and we're immediately going to focus our attention on the top five if we don't see what we're looking for in the top five then we may we may forget get further down on the list of uh you know the ranking but uh where this is a big task and uh and it's very important and we value your opinion and honestly um not that we don't trust ourselves but we trust you so much that we feel like this is something we should share in the decision making and that's where your expertise and opinions will kick right in and help us to at least narrow it down so that now we've got a smaller group instead of 50 people so we have the process and we're now we're down to five and we're looking at it at what point do we take into consideration the um things like the background check and those other items such as social media okay so here's whenever we uh whenever we have what we consider the top five then the next step if you look through the the hiring process okay the next step will be background checks okay and um and then that may very well eliminate somebody and then we'll have to drop down and select the next candidate okay i just didn't want i'm glad it's at the top of at the head of the list right instead of getting all excited about something before phone interviews all that stuff will be done so you should weed yes and once we've we've narrowed it down to what what the council thinks are the top five then that's where we'll have a zoom interview and we'll get to know the candidates and then start trying to make a decision okay um so that's that's that's the uh thought process does anybody have any questions i i do have one the the background check not to skip totally ahead but is there a a third-party entity that you would use to do that like criminal check financial check i'm trying to remember the name of it oh yeah i don't need the name of it just to know pharma all right that qualified that you would just say well that means it's ba in public i would say that they probably um wasted their money based on the amount of money they're getting yeah and being a psychiatrist would help them immensely in this community but not anymore previously would have helped a lot dave would you say masters is preferred what's that you're in the javascript of our qualifications well um did say masters is preferred what we did was um actually based upon the original job listing it said aba was what they were looking for i didn't see a master's was preferred but it may have been added i don't think it was i don't i don't recall saying well the job summaries is this it says right in the first paragraph with qualification qualifications in the uh in the job district yeah five years progressive responsible experience a bachelor's degree public ad business ad related field master's preferred well we could always add that and that's why i'm presenting this to you if you want to change we still have plenty of time so i guess the question is is i mean is this is a public a va that would be a five you couldn't necessarily make road making a three or a four well um you know what the way that i originally designed it was it was a va or higher and so if you prefer to have a masters with a higher score then what we could do is we could always change these but the way that originally it was designed was if you get the ba you automatically get a five um in either business or public administration um in those categories in those categories correct if we want to as a team we want to change this a little bit right now it's an oddball score it's 40. if you want to make it 50 well what we could do could we put the other and have that big handling masters and give that a five we could probably do that and still here then you're not getting preference to the master so the way to do that no you can give it a six change that scoring as the other if you really want to prefer somebody with a master's if they have a masters in in public administration right yeah well so what i could do is i could actually go in here and see still have score one and add those two uh in those two categories and say if you've got a master's in either one you get a ten and then what that would do is that would give you it's pretty high waiting there for a children what's that yeah you're gonna get a lot of credit just to a degree in the degree and that's why i didn't do it that way so i think that you know if anything you want to make it a seven one to two points more could do that if i could if i could weigh in on that sure and i think rob would concur with what i'm about to say okay 24 years experience in the military some people are absolutely totally book smart don't ace a test right practical hands-on experience out there right you understand saying and then sometimes it can be the other way around and i've in my leadership roles i've seen it both ways i've seen people who get it hands-on but to sit down if you will and write the test or take the course they struggle to make a passing grade be considering so i would i would concur with i would give it more deployment yeah a couple of a couple of bonus points yeah um okay and that's if the council instead of master's degree is actually preferred otherwise we could just change yes what i can tell you is that the council did bless this yeah and what i would have to do is i would have to go back and present it to them in the next work session we have time because i have one yeah so this hasn't went anywhere and you have so this is because there's nowhere near the deadline this didn't go out with the application request for annotation we'll maybe just modify to take master preferred out okay let me let me take another stab at it and uh i'll present it to the council uh everybody agree that whatever the council agrees to that we move forward on it yeah okay correct and i would agree with ron if if the council wants to give an edge to a master's it's not more than a one or a two point okay right but again to your point about the phd there they may have wasted their money on the maps yeah i'm just saying so you may find someone and that's someone who has a master's degree but when it gets down to experience credit yeah exactly okay well did you see any other discrepancies so far can i go back to what was brought up earlier about the uh background checks on social media you're only going to do that for the ones that make the cut not everybody right and and it sounds like patty's doing a little bit of google searches she's doing some google stuff i've done some too i've already disqualified the guy that reached out to me well okay the question to at hand is as part of the screening process are we the committee at that next phase going to have access to those to continue or is that something just for council i think because you you ranked them all and the the timeline that we're on okay this may this may be the end of that journey okay okay obviously you'll see the outcome and you're welcome to come along and everything's public record um mainly this is we we feel like you're because you're ranking them all you're not just ranking the top five you're actually ranking them all so let's say one of the top fives that's thrown out because he's terrible um then the next uh number six will drop right into that place and you you still selected them uh and that's why while we're doing this exercise okay that's fine i understand okay my question about the background and the social media checks okay background checks what what is a discriminator felony any misdemeanor what what do you turn up to get somebody scratched we don't have that standard here within the city as an ordinance or anything i don't believe no they the the last background checks were pretty pretty detailed that that company yeah oh yeah you're going to get domestic abuse charges you're going to get everything i get my question because there's somebody who will ask the question you know what why did with this person get scratched from the list so you're going to have to establish a standard if they have a felony conviction you know if a guy got a dui 25 years ago is he disqualified so that's a good point because when when i do hiring and if i see something if i like the guy a lot or the woman a lot and i've vetted everything else and then it comes all of a sudden it pops up and comes back i'll talk to him about it and i'll say tell me why is this tell me the story behind this and i think you're right but i think there's going to be a little difference between what you're doing as a private hiring yeah maybe you're do you're hiring for a public position and then i would have the same question about what does the social media check look like what in if you look at my social media my facebook page what disqualifies me we're where's the standard incoming town attorney i happened to go through this process with the town of kenneth city last year we got down to three people there was one candidate who had pending criminal charges unresolved and the question came up of what about what are standards i mean this person is innocent until proven guilty under the law but they don't have an entitlement to be a candidate in our town under the law and they're not going to be able to claim i was discriminated against we could just say we don't like the cut of your jib and that's how we narrowed down the first 33 people or whatever and so in that particular case i contacted them i asked them for their exposition of it and we found it doing our own searches they had not disclosed it and um and they were one of the like three to four finalists and once i made it known to the council the council just said we've got three finalists that means there's still two other people or four finalists there's still three other people i'd just rather not proceed and i will tell you from a legal standpoint that's that that's not an arbitrary and capricious decision such that they're creating liabilities so i think you may wish to consider some flexibility in that regard i have a lot more concern for this community as it relates to the social media side because if somebody says oh well they're a staunch supporter of you know presidential candidate x or you know whatever and i don't like anybody who's on that side of the aisle and i think they're going to run our community into the town you're going to get much more into free speech issues free affiliation issues and have something there unless they're advocating like come to illegal drugs with me on saturday that's that's something different and you can make those determinations for yourself but i would say i would be far more cautious on the social media disqualifiers than the criminal charges and you can just and there's also just general guidance if it's a crime of what we would call the law crime of moral turpitude like okay you were issuing false checks seven years ago okay that's we don't want you to you know in charge of our municipal budget and taxpayer funds so you start looking at those sorts of things but failure to disclose as you just said yeah and it was one of those things where it hadn't been explicitly asked in the process um yeah that wasn't that wasn't a specific question through the process in part because the pace they were moving at but um there was a lot more urgency they had several vacancies but just i offered that as a case study in this community on something you might inform your decision making you may need i don't know do you when these requests went out for applicants didn't say anything about do you have to disclose any criminal convictions well here's those applications that's when they advocate okay yeah they'll what what happens after the consul shortlist we will paddy will send out and it's on here and he'll send out the short list applications for them to return by the 16th of june right now and the reason for that is the fact that we've got to get some authorization from them to allow us to do that background check absolutely and that's on our application they have to sign yeah yeah because just because they submitted a resume that doesn't authorize it no it doesn't matter and it clearly states the act that was placed that um drug screening background check yeah you get a physical background check drug screening so i mean i so i guess my recommendation is that dave i think you and the council are going to talk a little bit especially on the social media thing what is the standard we're going to apply here and that's that's where randy will come in and give us a pep talk and and help us through that i think that that's in our best interest to do that because now i will tell you all next america and this is a time country what are you doing so nobody said you're convicted of anything we just don't want to hire you right yeah okay uh any other questions about the no today i preach so this this kind of makes it very quantitative this is you know science um right all right you have no subjectivity you know this is you know we'll just look at the facts and then the arts going to be the art of the hiring process comes accountable that's right in the interview and you know you know just you know when i hired for a new uh uh person to to to lead a public entity in tampa you know i think the best question i asked was do you leave bodies in your wake exactly it was interesting to get people's response to that question absolutely so uh other than that uh is there anything that doesn't seem straightforward i know i think this question just works i had two questions about first about the interviews how does that you said zoom interviews when the council comes down interviewing folks are you all going to be on the call or is it each individual council member going to do interviews with each of the five athletes the way that it's going to work is we're going to have a public zoom meeting and interview all the candidates one by one it was that the the plan we discussed um but i think right now we're leaning towards picking a couple of council members just to ask the questions and uh and see how that goes we'll know as soon as we do the first one whether we like the process or not or we may tweak it as we interview others but if all goes well they'll all be lined up the same night and i think as long as no one is speaking i believe that you guys can are more than welcome to watch it as long as you're not chiming in and talking to each other during that you know i think you guys would just control the zoom and whose bike's working right so let me have a little better understanding of that process as it applies to what we're doing by recording their answers on their their history of work so if i was interviewing someone and i looked and i saw that they were given mostly fives for one of these particular behavioral traits or abilities and other other candidates were also put rated at the same way are they going to be asked the same questions i'm not real sure again i haven't seen any of the applications or the resumes but once we have the top five from you we're going to go through and heavily scrutinize those we're going to read them know them inside out backwards and forth everyone here has been involved in hiring processes sometime in their lives we know when you see you know that's it's true uh and so that's a legal term it is and so what you're going to do is you're going to pick past by the way you're going to pick um you know one of these areas that you know they're weak on and or we are and we're going to ask them about it right but um that's that that's the process we're going to go through and then once we've interviewed everyone i'm sure we'll have a discussion and we'll uh we'll uh we'll vote on our favorite mark i think the challenge that you we're all going to face that are used to running these interviews ourselves is we're just going to be looking at a piece of paper i don't know i know we're looking at a resume and seeing which box is checked worse normally we like to ask those questions right it's going to be difficult for me to look at how they responded to the questions that were asked in the application and relate that to the number without having any interaction i guess what we're going to get is potentially a cover letter of why i'm qualified for this job and a resume and that's about all we're going to have yeah anything is googling she's going to okay with their application okay anything that she's found and that's how i found uh the the guy that reached out to me that he had been fired from his uh previous job so well there's a couple here in town that have had their times in the time of the times and then you know uh you know just going through this process i've looked on the east coast and i see there's some people that like getting in the press over on the east coast as well so especially when we're looking at you know i had a question dave as i was going through it under prior experience location in florida question mark coastal or beach and and i struggled but then i get it now like somebody from louisiana or south carolina that's on a coastal city we'll give them five points for being in a coastal city but the floor experience that's going to be a detriment and that's where you see it says score all under that category instead of one it's all so you they can get a maximum of 10 because they had florida and coastal community but if they only had coastal in louisiana well then they can only score five so that's going to be that's that's you but i think having that florida experience is absolutely kept for how our state works especially if you've worked with the florida legislature or other governing bodies you have the experience yeah and and the reason why we included coastal uh by itself even though they may not be from florida is because there are federal rules that they haven't to adhere to and so it's definitely a bonus even if you're not from florida sure but what we're really hoping for is you get both and they get a 10. you know and you could be even more specific and say gulf coast experience would be more important than say the pacific coast because of the issues with hurricanes and things that you face here that you wouldn't out there they would have other regions i could throw that out to the council too or is it too grand you typically see someone's going to be in the southeast that's applying versus a national school no it's all over the place yoga candidates from michigan new york colorado oh michigan you gotta go for them right yeah i i will tell you just in your current marketplace there are a lot of vacancies in the state of florida and for those of us watching trends we've seen a lot of people from northern states through covet or otherwise relocating here and this is a community like this is attractive to people who are saying i can come in here get a good seven to ten years get my foot hold in florida and you know right off into the sunset um so you will see candidates with likely a lot of experience and likely from very diverse states not just you're not just going to get florida i'll add also that if they say chicago beach that doesn't count chicago you like michigan on the on the west side mr mayor of lake michigan you cannot see the other side so it's just like an ocean they have ice issues that's a little bit there is one from there i would not doubt it we even got one from minnesota well any other questions my only other question was um you know we would have in the military a right seat ride meaning that the person taking the job would come in and spend a week with the person leaving the job right right along with them in the right seat type that's the example to learn all those little things that you don't get by reading the sops and reading all the background stuff so lynn is going can we talk the current city manager into something like that i i told the council i would help them out but you know i'm going to be here and there well because you know better than anybody else what it takes yeah yeah and you have a pretty good sense of human behavior and your input would be valuable so what what lynn is saying is yeah he's probably going to give the guy a month's worth of experience which is what what i asked for recently was hang out for a month he said no anyway uh he's he's lynn has uh agreed to work with us for about a year and uh it won't be all at one time it'll be spotty here and there as needed but um i believe that any time that the new uh city manager needs some assistance he will be in touch with lynn that's great thank you thank you very much and uh he's not doing it for free i know but in his bracket he doesn't need any more he's going to make it it was three months when he made the year yeah for is is lynn going to have some input into the uh background of these of the you don't want to yeah it's best not okay no no that's just not yeah that's fine and um and we'll just see how it goes because okay i don't have anything else i believe that pretty much covers everything uh it's just very appreciate you go through the scoring sheet if we have questions we know where to find you yeah in fact uh i have a new city phone so i want to give everyone a reward with my number so you can call me directly if you do have it you want me to pass these out yes please okay does that mean the old number doesn't work anymore oh the old number works i'm just trying to calm it down yeah segregation duties [Music] the maximum for each one is one point correct so yeah it's very yeah demonstrated abilities maximum 10 so if we don't think they have government finance experience it's a zero that's correct once it's one yeah okay so we will be reading the uh the job history and the application for that information yes you'll be getting a resume not the application the resume yeah is the application we won't have anyone fill out until they show up afterwards okay yeah okay but did we give them a format for the president no so we're going to have to that's what i'm going to have to read we're going to have to interpret patty give us also the the advertisement yeah just never do that just so that we know definitely you want to see that and that way you can look through it and go oh look it falls almost in the same order he wrote this not really but yeah you'll see just about every single thing that's on there because this is so linear and the other is so subjective right that's going to be the rub for us to to well i think he meant this hence the interpretation yeah but we're we're up for the challenge okay so let's see i know in the job description we put nims certification and then you put fema on here so maybe just do fema nationals because isn't that what it's asking for well then uh it's a little of both you know the original there there's some requirements to have uh i think it's up to 800 nim's courses city managers public works have to have a certain level of them they're like 100 200 300 or 800 so there's some training there i would doubt that very few people are going to have that and i don't think it was a list that only happened that's posted right now so demonstration of continuing education courses within the scope of what the job responsibilities are is that going to be asked or are we just going to try to get that from the application from the resume i think you'd get that from the resume if you haven't asked that because we would want them to put certifications i haven't really spent any time looking at them patty will say well we have another one okay okay and i'll flip through a couple pages the the a lot of them that have some people have said they have news courses some don't but that's an emergency management thing that you know you're it's kind of a requirement you're supposed to do and it's for emergency operations and some of those courses because they're more than one day they're actually taught by the county or somewhere in the area and then some of the courses you do online they're the uh what's it the incident what is that called emergency management institute in uh black and where that place is at hemisphere yeah but some of them are on life the council has to do it uh different different courses and i'm sure the royal city manager has to do the same thing if not a lot more so uh yeah they require that so you can get uh your femur when you have to deal with females you're supposed to have a lot of that stuff just all the things you went through getting reimbursed and making sure following all the proper recipes yeah and that that's important yeah yeah fema stuff because you have a hurricane you want to try to get as much like last time we spent about 120 and we got 110 of 120 because you did it right now and you had documentation i kept the documentation that's the whole key to it right here yeah pictures oh yeah lots of pictures they're still on the computer yeah the waste guys to get reimbursed or pick it up it had to be picked up with the right type of equipment but the right type of caller if it wasn't and take it to the right kind of place with a receipt for dumping yeah and you've got to tag all that stuff exactly great anybody have any questions on the timeline so it looks like uh 26 we'll get packages we'll turn them to paddy on june 1st and then we'll get together um sometime between either the 6th or the 8th i guess to review and make sure our short list is is accurate and then we'll send them to the council and then they'll yeah and i i think the council dave you can say but i i think the discussion has been these dates could flex a little bit yes because we can't you know eddie's going to have a big chore scoring them uh and you're going to have a big shorts chore scoring them to give them to patty so you know if it i think we'll figure that out if we need to if this gives me on our anticipated deadline then uh we already expect kyle to be the interim city manager and uh and then of course lynn is sort of held on retainer yeah so so we're not we're good there truly under the wise mentor is everyone's availability yes yes yes if you get them off the golf course yeah good luck with that part of the time i'm going to be on a terminal lead you know what that is right back and forth unreachable all right gentlemen well i appreciate everything that you're about to do for us and uh it's it's going to definitely definitely help the council uh too so we can stay focused on getting the budget done and and continue moving forward i think so far it's uh it's moving efficiently and uh i'm looking forward to seeing what you can do great right all right thanks man so any back to the calendar anybody have any questions on the calendar timeline okay i think we're good um any other general business to review quick question or if i may um and if the mayor will hold for a minute lynn i asked you after the council meeting the other night about the contract for uh 12th and 13th street how long that contract price was good for did you get an answer back fourth of june fourth of june okay um we're going to discuss that monday okay my comment was after the conversation with with through the council the other night at the meeting was i understood their concern and mine as a taxpayer about the price on this and how much that contract was going to eat into american rescue plan money i know you're looking for a uh excess of going into capital projects or whatever there i wanted to suggest that the committee recommend or urge going forward that when you table items especially significant ones like this know the drop dead date of the current contract so that if in this like this example here is prime you have a short timeline you get a work session hammer it out and if need be i don't know what the cost is involved in that have a special counsel meeting to get it done before those numbers go up i mean yeah and if you if you've noticed i have uh one of the things that i've been trying to push is expediting all these projects right understanding and trying trying to get them knocked out however whenever a council member motions for a table no i get it yeah i i can't stop it everybody no no no no i get that i'm i'm no parliamentary yeah they'll get the engineers going to come to the meeting okay they'll get some feedback okay uh i actually uh gave uh councilmember roberts a phone number speak to the engineer directly if you want okay do you have a can you share your immediate opinion on which way you think we should go well the engineer basically my opinion is you're going to have to move forward there there's a alternate option i guess you could do is gamble on the pipes but the issue is the pipes are at the end of their useful life that's that's the issue and your you know the comment was made about slip lining well the slip lining cost is more than the cost of digging the pipe up it's 210 dollars a linear foot to slip on now for the the outfalls that go in between houses that's all you can do you can't go dig up between two houses because what do you got you got your foundation 10 feet and 10 feet and then you got every buried line and cable and sewer line and you can't do that so with those when we need to do that you're going to have to spend the money to slip line those but what you can do in the street yeah yeah it makes no sense to spend good money after bad and then you got to go back at some point in the future and fix it anyway and fix it do it right you know do it right the second time and if you're if you're plowing up the street for resurfacing just go ahead okay no i appreciate you you kind of brings up just something that's been stewing on the back of my mind you know as far as part of our exercise here in the council is do we sit down and look at the the budget of what's needed to fix all the storm water and recommend you know do we do a bond issue because costs are only going up and you know this has paid off in three years but yeah yeah we've got you know some potential bandwidth and we take some of the reserves and take some debt does it make sense to preserve you know what more it could cost or yeah or any of us have a crystal ball that says concrete's coming down and steel's coming down and so i don't expect it to come down so it's just something i've been thinking that probably as it counts we should probably you know i'll get together and put some math homework together and just think it through and i'd like to have that conversation with you yeah just because uh i everything's going up and we're not really making anything on our money so let's use some of it and then replenish it later well we might get a percent now because oh yeah so dave this number for calls and texts yes i never actually tried it i finally put all my contacts in it so at least i know whether i want to ignore you or not okay [Music] expediting and nothing about the potential for a bond issue in a future date okay so let's do some homework before we even absolutely okay official business may i ask i think and it's my my lack of knowledge maybe about this beach renourishment that patty said something about sent a document from what i understood to be a citizen that came in presented it to the council yeah is it i'd love to get some background on that what's this is she's arguing that they can take their beach back or they should be able to is that what you read out of that yeah i i don't think it it would go anywhere but uh i think we have much bigger fish to fry and i am i'm beginning to make a stink about it but it's it's not i'm not bashing people or anything like that i'm just asking for help from from everyone because uh charlie crist doesn't seem to do anything and they've backed him they've bagged him and the county seems to think that charlie crist is the the missing link that's going to to get our beach nourishment and i just don't believe that's the case on the other hand don't hold your breath on the other hand all these people signed easements and they're not getting anything for their money and and um that document that i read which uh did you send that did you send that to me i i've got it in my inbox the 25 page document oh i don't know how big it is it's in my i got something this is the one where they were uh saying if you've already signed the easement you screwed up and here's why and um and and uh it was circulated by a couple of attorneys you probably know who they are down in indian shores and uh and it was to discourage future easement signers um i don't know how much of that is true that's one reason why i wanted you to take a look at it also and tell me so i know the facts but right now pinellas county is sitting on the largest reserve they've ever had and why what do they what they need all this money for um it's a small percentage to fix the beaches compared to what they're holding and um if if the fed's not going to do it and they're they're not going to require they're going to require these easements permanently to continue doing this well maybe we need to go back to dallas county and say hey you know this is this is how we make our money we all benefit from tourism and you're you're always saying you're green and you're wanting to protect the turtles and the birds and everything else but you're willing to let our beaches wash out into the ocean and go down to madeira beach and that's where all our sand is by the way it's in madeira beach right now you have to drive a mile out almost to get around the sandbar it is so bad backed up right now so i'm beginning to lean towards turning it back on the county and saying we don't need the fed for this i know why the county is doing it and it's it's in there financially it's in their best interest to do it but at the end of the day if they don't if the fed doesn't do it then the county has to because eventually we're not going to have a beach and no tours and no tourists market values decline too of course absolutely well we've lost 50 percent roughly based on what the width of the beach was it was about 180 90 feet and we're 90 feet from the back of the dune not from the opposite side i'm talking yeah and i uh i got with all the big city mayors uh and charlie justice and had cliff cliff gibbons write up a very nice letter because he's a he's a washington lobbyist and he knows exactly how to do it so i had him draw it all up i sent it to the county the county uh charlie justice wanted it slightly modified it wasn't exactly what i was asking for but it was much better than nothing and and i had every mayor up and down the beach even those that were not impacted because you go south of john's past and they're getting their nourishment but they went ahead and signed anyway because they were all in they wanted us to get this and so um chris got it rubio got it scott got it no reply nothing crickets and you would think all these mayors sending you a letter in a red label envelope somebody ripped it open it would get some nothing absolutely nothing which tells me they don't care they don't care um so that's uh that's where we are right now i'm still chris chris is more concerned about becoming governor again yeah and he and i have had to go around i i called him out seriously several months ago about his voting and he basically responded to me we can agree to disagree so he was telling me to go jump off him well there he is all right so any other business if not can i get a motion to adjourn so moved same second all in favor aye"
