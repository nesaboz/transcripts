questions may have you know how your report lags up behind and all that but nothing popped off the page when I read it the first time but I don't know if anybody has specific questions or any concerns that we going I can address while I'm here Council yes um it came to my attention is past weekend I'm sorry I can um I think right around the same time Mr Robert Shaw that you saw rescued person around that time there was attempted rape in Indian Rocks Beach are you aware of that it was in the I looked it up it was in the paper too yeah there was um there was a female that was joging on the beach there was a transient none neither of them live on the beaches um they visit the area but um there was a transient that begin falling her there's a battery occurred um thankfully wasn't a sexually battery um but the guy took off she was on with 911 whole bunch of charges came out of it what the end of it all was she was okay at the end um and we were able to apprehend the person we had K9 and flight out here and they tracked and caught him thankfully not of him from the area but yeah it was uh wasn't a good tring to be in the area so to speak well I can't begin to thank you guys for all service you guys do put yourself in the line of fire every day you guys are excellent you're blessed to have you and you're and you're all under my we we appreciate that thank you so much any other questions or comments one great one the motor vehicle effect uh did that occur in somebody's driveway or on the street do we know I don't I can get the answer for you get about the C just specifically was the motor vehicle Pro that excuse me yeah I'll give the information get to you thank you yes sir I have a question uh I was out of town over the weekend and I heard that there was traffic accident where a car overturned down around 12 13 near that Island I think that's is that the P the palm tree yes we um yes so I believe I believe that one was a Under the Influence one right yeah so typically what we'll do is I'll send the stuff in the morning to the city manager just distributor if you all the questions when you ask him he'll have it in this case the deputy actually sent it um it was a it was a driving Under the Influence related thing I can I can't tell you the number of times somebody said a pine or a palm tree out here or something on your medians and every single time they've been in talk you and I've been doing this seven years in this role so they just always seem to hit the medians and they seem to hit the countes um this time I need as much damage to I think they scraped it the last time they hit Indian Rocks I took the whole thing out it's just luckily no pedestrians or injured or anything like that even in this case the driver wasn't heavily injured type stuff but it was a DUI every they crash with an overturn car do you know about how fast he was I didn't I haven't seen any prelims on on the investigation so I couldn't answer but when I get the answer regarding the motor vehicle for that I'll get you that answer as well I appreciate it any other questions coms thank you app always a pleasure all right now we're up to the monthly code enforcement report good evening sir Deputy Richard Trump I apologize I'm not in uniform tonight got little private business going on right just after we leave here I'm just glad you're here thank you sir very much I appreciate it so uh it's actually slowed down down a little bit for the uh last month as far as code enforcements we uh have been doing a lot of patrols a lot of area checks and trying to make sure that everybody is uh staying in check here um we actually just 18% of the time has been unpermitted remodels and uh that uh has to do a lot with some of the follow-ups and everything else and but we found a couple of houses that were getting some solar just as an example um um it was a good company that was installing the solar but unfortunately they got a little overzealous and they started getting things installed before all the permits and everything else were in place they eventually did get all those permits and the stop work orders and everything were lifted off of those houses so everything went back and got closed then we had one other house that has a stop order on it again for the same permits it was just for some uh slight remodel so other than that uh things have actually been slow down a little bit um you'll see in the chart the other enforcement we added that that's a new category that I asked pile to add that was just so more that I can document like my extra patrols uh my beach patrols that I'm doing on the Polaris cuz I'm trying to get out there to watch for ordinance violations and everything um as far as the beaches also so that's a new category but I've been spending a lot of time as far as the area checks and everything so other than that with the weather a little bit but things seem to be kind of slow down and people are hopefully getting the idea that you know just do it right get your permits like you're supposed to I'm sure the word is out we're we're trying to do that any uh questions or comments for the day all right thank you very much sir thank you sir and enjoy your party no taking my wife out for lunch that's all right we are on to item number five presentation from the pel Sun Coast fire and rescue District I'm kind of disappointed that depy Trump and all his bunnies left because I just wanted to congratulate the other one and how good he felt being a fireman for a day when he was actually say heard my name I said Deputy Rich Show I just wanted to congratulate him on being a fireman for the day making a rescue and saving somebody I would make sure no good things and I know our chief is involved and like you said you guys are lucky and we're all lucky to have the deputies that we do in this area they are certainly topnotch um on behalf of the fire department I'm here this evening again Chief Davidson is uh getting some annual training for one of the certifications that he holds uh so therefore I am in his place once again but I always enjoy coming down here uh so to be quick and give you the updates um training hours for January we're starting to ramp back up I think I mentioned before towards the end of the year things kind of tail off as people are on vacation but we're getting back in the groove of things uh so far this year our men and women have put in 710 hours of fire training uh 160 hours of Medical Training uh for a combined total of approximately 170 hours of the train when it comes to my area of expertise fire inspections uh we performed in January 127 annual inspections 232 reinspection and in our Indian Rocks area performed 18 short-term rental inspections uh public education we were down here again uh my counterart Stacy was down here with a couple Folks at the health and wellness Fair she said it was a great turnout um we discussed ball prevention with the folks that came I I was not in attendance I believe I was at a hockey game until my son but um they said he give or take 50 people maybe showed up um they passed out some stuff uh we had multiple fire stations tour tours given um at Station 27 28 and I believe the beach cleanup was down here too the bridge cleanup I'm sorry was down here we set crew down here um so our guys and GS pitched in for that beach cleaner or Bridge cleaner like confusing the two um we want to pass along our special thanks to you folks for allowing us to utilize your great space here to um hold our district Chief uh promotional process I believe that went pretty well and we will also be back here again on Tuesday to uh perform the other portion which is the lieutenant promotional exam it's a little more in depth than the uh District Chief one this is more uh we'll say scenario and tactical based uh for the men and women that who are on excuse me in charge of the apparatus for the day uh operationally Chief Davidson and chief carpent are continuing to work with the county on obtaining a transport Gable rescue to put in service which I believe we're also working with Kyle on looking for a home during these that this unit will be in service at First it's not going to be a 78 we 24hour thing uh we'll slowly phase it in and I believe one unit or another will be located here in the meantime until we get that other station constructed in Ro the M Rocks Beach um as far as the calls were concerned we had there was a total of 11 calls for service in val Beach there were four motor vehicle crashes one I believe that he alluded to two water rescues again one of which uh the gentleman obtain reward for and three medical calls there was also during one of the storms I believe there was electrical Hazard and one firearm and a residential structure that's all I have for you this evening either excuse me any of you folks have any questions anyone have questions just really thank you thank your guys for coming out that bridge I mean uh put it on the website now we a bunch of kids from high schools we certainly appreciate the partnership that we have with you folks and I appreciate you having me out this evening all right now we are up to item six which is the city attorney's report Mr Mo uh thank you Mr Mayor I don't have any uh significant report apart from the agenda items tonight to answer any questions you might have um we we are forging ahead with the legislative session of course that concludes March 8th so we're just about at the halfway point of the legislative session um for those of you who are tracking um Lega City circulates uh Publications and we periodically update you memoranda some of the Bills moving through right now one that could preempt local jurisdictions on short-term rentals um they're looking there's been some traction on the bills to increase Homestead exemptions which of course effect cities and revenue streams and the like but um if you have any specific questions I'm happy to answer any questions Council all right Mr I'm sure we'll be discussing more short now we're up to item seven the city manager report Mr reer thank you mayor uh just to run through the project quickly the uh Golf Boulevard undergrounded project um the latest from duke is the uh utility consultant of Florida our project management um Consultants that are working with us they need to go and uh request each uh property um that Duke is wanting to put equipment um to see if they would consider signing off on an easement um given the size of the RightWay on golf Bard um you feel like property owners are not going to want to sign that e both we are in the process of um check it with each property owner to see if it's something they will have to consider otherwise the plan will go back to the original request which was to put the uh switch boxes in the uh in the U can't think the name of it the uh whatever the other I'm trying to think um I can't transform is okay yeah the Transformers is on the RightWay because on Golf Boulevard you you have about 8 ft to the sidewalk and then you have another 8 ft after that that goes to the property line so there's plenty of room um for some reason um Duke is insisting that we request easements to put it on the property um we did so on the south portion and we couldn't get them all so they ended up moving it back to the right way just say keep you in the look of what's going on I I suspect that you know it'll irritate some residents to have this request but um it's part of the process right now to to go through this um storm water Improvement project uh we have it on the agenda for the award uh along with the storm water pump system design which is discussed in the work session so that are two items coming up on the agenda the code review service we had the introduction by Lou Cerna um and he went over kind of the process that we're going to be going through we're going to divide up the chapters that he mentioned um into different groups the first group is going to be on February 19th work session and the chapters that are going to be covered are chapter 10 22 30 and 50 so chapter 10 is building and building regul regulations chapter 22 is environment Chapter 30 Marine structures activities and facilities and chapter 50 is Street sidewalks and other public ways and the RFP for auditing Services next month's meeting we are going to have salt marsh our contractor for our audit come in and present the draft act for which is the uh the uh annual copy of financial report um then the draft will go to the audit committee who will meet and at that time we will go over a selection criteria for the RFP so we can move forward on next year's audit contractor and that's all I have any questions yes Kyle so the gold Boulevard undergrounding what what streets does this particular phase address so this is going to be North for cos Boulevard um and they're breaking is phase two um which we've talked about in the planning process phase one was South C bevard Phase 2 is north but the breaking phase two into two parts from um Causeway to 22nd Street and then 22nd Street to the marina okay so this is the causeway to 22nd Street days um what's both they're they're they just got to go down the line to each each spot where they designed to put equip and ask um if if the property owner is willing to Grant an easement um for this um naturally there's push back because people look at their yard they go wow there's a lot of space why do I need to put the equipment on my private proper okay thank you that's what we're timeline timeline oh we're they're completely done um and the equipment is covered on the south end so that's we have all the materials in the marina that should be happening in a matter of months for phase one for phase two um optimistically hoping that we could get um rolling with utility Consultants of Florida's part of the job which is installing the conduit 3 to four months um throughout this project they they move through everything we need to do and then we can't wait for for decisions to be made and if you can't get the easements what's what's the uh what's the backup plan backup plan is we just put in in the right away any questions thank you Mr reer appreciate thank you all right we are on to the city clerk report I include Ed my monthly summary in the agenda packet and I don't have anything of significance to report it looks like business as usual yes any questions or comments I wanted to thank you very much for the completeness of the agenda excuse me the U the minutes of meetings where you actually do more than just record the votes but a little bit about the discussion I find that very helpful sure anyone else thank you appreciate it now we're on to consent agenda items 9 and 10 this is for approval of the January 8th 2024 city council meeting minutes and approval of the January 29th 2024 city council work session minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve as written and presented motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second Elliot also all in favor I any oppos agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 11 this is for consideration of appointment to the board of adjustments current alternate member Mark Mariano if Mr Mariano is here would he like to introduce himself to the counc well I guess he's not here would anyone like to any citizen like to uh comment on this appointment see did outo Drive Mr Mar has been an alternate member and so he's a great fit for him to De slide to a voting member thank you all right uh Council I'm going to need a motion to appoint Mariano to the board of adjustments Mo motion is made by Frank again do I have second goes to lyd Roberts Mr Banker do you have the floor uh he's already in alternate as gentleman said it's just a slide position take vote all right let's do a roll call vote council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis hi so it's unanimous congratulations go out Mr Marano and thank you for serving our city all right now we're up to item number 12 this is for consideration of awarding project bid B 23-01 for Street grage improvements from Street to Morgan Drive placed on the agenda by city manager Reaper Mr Reaper you have the floor thank you mayor um to recap this project is uh to wrap up the rest of the uh stormw m master plan it spans from the uh 9th Street in the South to Morgan drive all the way north um most of this is uh necessary uh maintenance and um repair for our aging storm water system um quickly there's uh about 26,000 square yards of milling and resurfacing for the streets 21,000 M ft of curb replac and 1,700 uh Cure place pipelining the uh there was two bids um that came in on demand star where we advertised and they were cinga and Ru voits Incorporated and harbor Contracting LLC and harbor Contracting came in lowest um significantly by close to $500,000 and uh we uh checked on their projects checked on their work experience um checked on how they feel about getting the project complete in our timeline and everything came back great um they have active jobs with our neighboring City to the south at new rock speach um and they uh speak highly of Harvard Contracting so um it is my recommendation that we award the uh B 23-01 um storm water Improvement project to the Lois better Harbor Contracting LLC okay before we go to council comments and debate would any citizen like to comment on awarding this project to haror contract yes sir please come up John hanser 22nd Street I understand the city manager to say this is primarily maintenance and repair so if somebody can refresh my memory is my understanding that the remaining storm water system was supposed to be camera to determine whether or not new pipe needed to be done so I'm based on what you just said assuming no pipe is going to be replaced is that that that's correct only only cure and place lining for repair okay the other thing I want I I'm in favor of this I mean the citizens advisory committee worked on this very very hard while Lynn was still the uh city manager and we came up to try to cost reduce this to where once we started we would finish it all the way at one time instead of in phases moving equipment off site and then bringing it back because of the expense I'm assuming that's what this contractor is going to do to save the city money so I stand here in favor of this being approved we're into February hurricane season is going to start in a few months it'd be nice to get the majority of this done before hurricane season we've already had two storms in recent months that have created havoc and it only going to get worse if we something hits us again so y'all need to vote on this and get going on it thank you thank you Mr would any other citizens like to comment on this topic right citizen comments are closed Council I'm going to need a motion to award project bid b2301 to Harvard Contracting LLC were you making a motion yes Roberts second Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you mayor we discussed this um obviously the last meeting at which point it did not pass so there's been a lot of information available for this project the benefits why the city needs it uh I think that the uh city manager did a great job of explaining the details and the cost it's time to move on this and get it done other comments from the council yes um while I voted no last month I'm going to support this this month because during a work session where some people think don't get done we actually made an agreement and I want to thank my colleague here uh up with an idea and a study pumps which would affect her neighor but the whole city so I just want to say I think that's the way government should work work things out come to an agreement and benefits every that's it I'm very happy to support this measure than and I'm very happy uh to support both measures GL we were able to work through this uh so uh if there are no other comments I'm going to ask Rene to do a roll well council member bankard yes council member Roberts hi council member Shaw Elliot yes and mayor gtis I so it passes unanimously the contract is awarded to Harbor Contracting LLC and thank everyone for working for this all right we are up to item number 13 this is for consideration of ordinance 24-1 this is a first reading C the attorney Mo would you please read the ordinance happily Mr Mayor this is ordinance 20241 an ordinance of the city council the city of b beach amending chapter 2 Administration Article 2 city council division one generally to create section 2-31 of the city's code of ordinances entitled compensation of council to establish an annual salary for members of the city council and guidelines governing reimbursement providing for the imple implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance 20241 by title only on first reading council members this is a direct this ordinance was uh produced in direct response to um at least uh potential consensus Direction at the work session last week um I drafted this based on the discussion you have as we are on first reading I want to underscore if this is not what you have in mind pleas let me know we can revise then as appropriate um the numbers used the the mayor during the work session provided um backup materials on what other communities compensate their council members I believe the sample that was recommended be used for this draft were the numbers from Indian Harbor Beach um and so those are the numbers that you see reflected here that's where those numbers came from in terms of the 350 uh for the mayor and the 250 for uh individual council members there was a somewhat lengthy discussion about expenses and a general understanding and agreement I think this is in line with your current practices that where you for example to go to the leading City's annual conference the registrations and things like that are typically handled by the city this memorializes that I would suggest that there was a discussion at one point that um perhaps in of or as an alternative to a salary perhaps having reimbursed expenses that are directly associated with the office such as prep preparation um and completion of financial disclosure forms be accounted for that is not explicitly provided for here if that is something that you intend to provide for I would suggest that you make That explicit so that there can be no misunderstanding and there's not a question on trying to fit some you know the square the proverbial square peg in the round hole but since that had been disced discussed as an alternative to a salary and this uh and the proposed measure was a salary I did not include that here nor do I is it my opinion that that would fall broadly within this I would prefer that if you intend to make something that distinct that you do so explicitly uh to avoid any any issues but that's the ordinance you have before you as far as the effective date you will see here because of your Charter it the ordinance shall become effective immediately upon enactment by the city council that's the ordinance itself but pursuant to section 2.03 of the city of Beller Beach's Charter the portion of this ordinance establishing a salary for Council Members shall become effective upon the date of commencement of the terms of council members elected at the second regular election following passage of this ordinance beginning first with the regular March 2024 election cycle so that would that says that the first of the two the first will be March Prov we have this adopted on the second and final reading before thank you Mr MOA before we go to the councel would any citizen like to comment on this proposed ordinance all right citizen comments are closed Council need a motion to approve ordinance 24-1 someone motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second seconded by Elliot Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor personally I couldn't care less about receiving the salary my comments at the workshop were the following if this minimal salary that we're going to give out if it's approved would assist any of our citizens that were interested in being on our Council and the one thing that may have been holding them back would be the cost Associated for them with regards to the form six by having to hire someone to assist them and that varies depending on the complexity of U the financial situation of some of our citizens but if that if this one item will help people feel like they're more comfortable in running for a Council seat than I'm in favor of it and that's why I'm supporting it thank you Mr Roberts else like to make a comment I would EO those remarks that's the only reason why I would support this um I think that um as Mr Banker explained at the meeting it is an honor to serve on this committee we're not looking for salaries or for salaries for future people but just trying to find a means to help fill this board with qu five people and and and try to eliminate any barriers that they might have thank you any other comments um I'm I'm dead against this but to work with you Mr Mayor going to both for um I don't $250 a month $300 $350 a month it's going to make anybody's decision change the one for Council or not I totally believe this is an honor to serve your people Val Beach I think this is one great community and one of the reasons is because it's so much volunteerism and while I'm going to vote for it I'm also going to V because this doesn't go early into effect 2027 it's earliest the earliest and and the just for for the benefit of all when I say at the earliest that depends in part on how your election Cycles May flush out following the charter votes the election and it can always be be repealed by the next Council every ordinance is subject to Amendment thank you all right and uh my reason for uh for bringing this to the council was um you see right now we have four we have a full council members uh it's bad enough that the State of Florida is bearing down on us forcing us to do this for six uh I don't I don't see it getting better I only see it getting worse and every time that I meet with other Mayors um and we trade stories they all they all say you know we're not in this for the money but whenever they hear that we're getting nothing for what we're going they they don't understand why we're doing it and I'm not going to say that anyone is is better or worse than than b beach everybody has their own set of values but what I will say is that this is a very very small in fact I think the lowest salary that I can find in all of pelis County to compare us to and so I matched that salary and instead of thinking about it as a salary it's more of an appreciation pay for what we have to go through every day in the city um so that's why I propose this and that's that's uh I'm hoping in the future we're not going to be where we're at right now but we have full Council and we have people that are willing to step up and uh and join us and this fight to keep our city what it is and that's all I have to say any other comments before I call for a no all right Renee would you please call the RO council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis hi and the first reading of ordinance 24-1 passes and we will vote on this again next mon thank you once again to all my fellow council members all right now we're up to item number 14 authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated for the investigation and design of a storm water pump system city manager reper you have thank you may okay so this is the uh Pump Station design project that we discussed in the last work session uh gini engineering has put together a scope of services um the beginning work of this project is to uh look at some of the existing surveys we have also get information on the Underground utilities throughout the area of 9 Street um do some geotechnical investigation and um explore what power is available to um run a pump that we're uh considering and um once this information is collected they're they're going to come up with a design um they've already can start started uh communicating with the pump company the Mi pumps that came to the presentation here in December and um they're going to uh find out give us a good estimate of of cost for the project and uh what to expect on how effective uh a feasibility study um would be to to install pump and what effect it'll have on the area of nin street so um that would be before we move forward with any uh actual construction so I built in um based on the timeline provided by Gemini engineering the they estimated about one to two months to gather this information and then uh we would have them come in do a presentation to the city council um to uh to explore if there's any revisions they want made or um just explain overall what they've discovered and um so that the council can make a decision on at that point um again the overall cost of the PO is 22,000 um but you know that'll be as we go throughout the project um how how be buil out so just wanted to lay that out um again I include the proposal that uh work with engineer Larry fluty and not designing for what we need so that is all thank you Mr let's go to the citizens for comment Mar be L Drive unless we do something like the Netherlands did to block any water from the ocean coming in but pumps out there when we have a an incident a few times during the year to me is not cost effective and it's a waste of money just my opinion eventually I think we could change name in the city in another 100 years none of us will be around probably call it elair Venice Beach because we're going to have flooding of every street and probably have gondolas going up and down the street it's just a matter of time thank you thank you Mr Mr H John H 22nd Street you know several meetings back when we had many more residents here and we discussed this issue of flooding a statement was made and reality is folks we're surrounded by water that's it's just like the previous resident you want to illuminate the water build a wall and even that isn't a guarantee uh yeah I understand people down at the South End of the city which is lower than where I'm at complain a little bit but we have these check valves I'm assuming they function the way they're intended to I'm an old US Navy engineer I know about bs big time I fixed them all the time in pumps so I don't get the point and the other thing is um the estimated cost of this um research is $22,000 uh when we went over the budget last year I don't know where it's going to come from it's not in the budget so somebody needs to Enlighten us as to where in the budget that money lies and I tend to concur I don't know that the pumps is the Wiest deal if everything else is working properly and in conjunction with that on a storm water system these receivers at the rain gutters if you will I can tell you that two or three of them there at Bay Shore in 22nd Street are two dad gum small Tre accept the amount of rain sometimes they're too small and we're not doing anything about that either so that's probably something else that should have been considered initially so I'm just bringing it up again I spent 24 years in the Navy on seven different ships I know about these things so appreciate it thank you thank you Mr Hansen would any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right citizen comments are closed to continue motion to authorize the execution of purchase order motion motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Kim Mr Banker do you have the floor well we did bring in one contractor uh back in December at the pumps um and I gave him a bunch of scenarios uh and it's true when the order breaks the wall it's going to consist the flooding the problem is on the south end of this island um we don't get rid of the water until the tide goes below 2.5 ft therefore back door nalia we had water in the street till 5:00 people have had it in their house uh National Guard didn't come down our street till I think 3: 4:00 in I movement vehicle because they couldn't get down any faster and the other thing is we just had a bad storm in December as mentioned which nobody evacuated it came in around midnight with 3 and2 to 4 feet of water in the street we don't really have any if someone had to get down these streets during an emergency ambulance or whatever you'd have to get a special unit to get down those streets so this is a matter of safety this is a matter of not doing the same thing we did 75 years ago by putting replacing pipes that never really worked um clearly as MWI pump Mr FY said if you had no water in the street before it breached the seaw wall even after it breached the seaw wall that would have would have been vacated through the pumps and it would have stayed being vacated for a long period of time uh yes he agreed that there might be water in the street it would be in the yard it would be in the driveway you go down to First Street up to even 14 15th Street it's a mess and we can do a lot better and just by repaving streets replacing pipes uh when we did by Street um 6 Street I believe the check vales are too low okay it don't open up until I think it's down to like 2.3 ft so that water just lays and accumulates for hours and it needs we need to correct thank you Mr Baker other comments it's my it's my pleasure to strongly support this measure and I'd like to emphasize that it is a feasibility study and I believe that it is our fiduciary duty as being uh the the trustees of the money in this community to evaluate all reasonable measures that are available to us and uh that's what this study is designed to do and um I support thank you Mr um like like the two citizens that spoke I think any time we have an opportunity to spend money to support our city we need to ask ourselves a few questions one of which would be a project that we're going to do does this support or Aid or help a majority of the citizens in our city so we have to ask that question we also have to ask you know the the amount of money we're going to spend for example if it doesn't support a majority of our citizens but it's a very small amount of money for the actual fix not not this particular study then then more than likely that would be something we would probably want to take on an expense if it's a large sum of money and it only really helps or supports a small portion of the city we don't like to say no to anybody that are having problems but we need to make smart decisions with the money we're spending we don't know right now what that cost is going to be for the potential repair so this is a feasibility study as was stated earlier I'm trying to approach this with an open mind because my gut tells me the solution is not going to be inexpensive in order to try to keep this water out of here and that's what we need to rethink about how we're doing it now there could be multiple ways to to pay for this it may not even be the city's money you know perhaps the residents that live in that area could take on some of that cost or all of that cost kind of like when part of our city put in underground um electrical stuff so they paid for that be in an assessment on their tax bills so things like that we need to consider so no citizen I'm sorry um we close citizen comments and we we don't do back and forth during these debates I apologize but uh that's that's our standard practice um are you so we did we did talk about this at length at the workshop and for this feasibility study so that we can at least have an answer as to what a solution potentially can be along with some Associated cost I would say sort of reluctantly I'm going to support this but I am going to support it so we can move forward all right and uh give you a little backstory if you didn't see uh the the last regular council meeting uh we're in a situation right now to where the only way anything can pass because of our Charter rules you have to have a minimum 4 yes votes everything has to be aned um this feasibility study was required for us to be able to pass the storm water grain project uh there was no no other way around around it it was killed by someone sitting up here and um this was through negotiations this is what we came up with this doesn't say that we're going to spend millions of dollars on pumps what it says is that we're going to do a feasibility study and see if it's even possible will it work and if so then we'll go forward from there and we'll have to V again uh but this is the way that sometimes in politics you have get things done and so uh I am all for this and I actually hope that we're able to do it I hope that it actually works out just one more I uh contacted the state and I'm also contacted the FED there are a lot of grants that support these studies okay um pump replacement pump installations it may cost us very minimum to do this as NWI pum said don't do it the whole city at one time do a couple of streets we got nth Street we're going to rip up let's do nth Street see what works take allers Tak some problems away from City Hall it doesn't work maybe it doesn't cost us that much money but know we do is study out we can do we have any other comments from counil all right going to do another another call just for the record this is to authorize the city manager uh for the execution of a purchase order for the investigation and design of a storm water pump system council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis hi Mr reer you are authorized toce thank you all right we are on to item number 15 which is consideration for Public Works pay increases this was placed on the agenda by city manager reer Mr reer you have a FL thank you mayor uh so this is a pay study that uh over the past couple months uh Public Works uh department head Community servic Services administrator has collected um some information from local municipalities um cities throughout pal County this um was brought on by the fact that we've been experiencing increase in costs um especially cost of living for um this area of Florida and uh we wanted to compare the uh the wages to what other municipalities were paying employees so once we uh gathered all the information I uh well the community services administator compiled it for me and then I evaluated I included a uh chart of the see nine municipalities that we were able to get job descriptions and varable um wages from Tri the arrange of order um that you could see uh in comparison we have two positions we have a service worker 3 which is a functions it's crew leader and we have two service worker two positions um when you go through other municipalities depending on the size um and what uh you know what work they do whether they have different utilities Parks um facilities it's um you know you have to kind of look at um the different job description class comparable um I laid them out uh one thing I tried to um focus on is that you know I'm looking at a position that has um like a lead responsibility for um service work which are in our city it actually spans across you know Parks maintenance utility maintenance storm um and actual facilities um so um in doing so I uh laid them all out I couldn't find some some cities didn't have exactly what I was looking for as for a comparable but when I did lay them out and average them I use that average um which is down at the bottom of the vers that I put together um to deter what a recommended minimum would be for each position that we have um the last piece of that is um we have two fairly new employees um that have not put in a year of service yet um so I believe that it is um you know recommended I recommend that they stay at the starting salary but we do have another position that has been in the in that specific um Ser service worker 3 position for over a year and I made an adjustment um based on that based on what we typically do for our annual um NR Bas so that's how I arrived at the recommended adjustment and to restate the uh I recommend that we increase the hourly wage for service worker 3 which is the crew leader um from $21 per hour to 2468 and the service work two position from $18 per hour to $20 per hour um and I also asked that if we do move forward with these wage increases that we started at the current pay period which um began on January 28th thank you Mr rer let's go to the citizens for comments on this topic yes sir please come John Hans at 22nd Street where in the budget are we going to get this extra money over and above Merit pay raises that were approved in the budget for fiscal year 24 so answer that question if this is approved um calculating out the Personnel cost it would for a full year um we're looking at an increase of uh $18,000 in the public works budget um because we're about onethird into the fiscal year um currently it's about a $112,000 increase um that can be a budget adjustment that we can make at the next regular meeting or um typically we could um see how the rest of the budget plays out with expenditures and find out if we if we need to even move that much any other comments from the citizens all right citizen comments are closed need a motion to proceed with Public Works pay increases Mo motion made by La Roberts seconded by Frank Banger Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor the short time that I've been here I know the city has had difficulty in replacing St St that have moved on for whatever reason and coupled with the fact that we have very small crews out there in the field when I first came here we had uh two service workers and obviously if one of those workers are sick or injured or go on vacation there's many tasks out there that can't be done by one person so it's imparative that you have from a safety standpoint and an efficiency standpoint at least two people there we have since then brought on one additional P person so we have three which is great but again I reiterate that the times that we have had one or two of those positions vacant it just took a long time for anybody to step up to the plate and apply first of all and a lot of it had to do with the salary so that was the I think it's a great idea that Kyle came up with to raise those to make them competitive with our other Beach communities down the street so that when and if we need to fill a position we'll at least be competitive and be able to fill them so that's why I'm supporting thank you Mr Roberts other comments U Mr manager if you can confirm for me please are we fully staffed or do we have any open positions we currently have admin assistant position open which is under the n departmental budget right this this department is fully staffed yeah correct it's been fully staffed since um the beginning of this C and I wanted to thank you for the charts and the comparison it made it made the data very easy to read and understand so thank you I'm good with the whole thing all right and based on what I've seen with our neighboring and and you know it's kind of hard to compare Apples to Apples because we do have employees that wear so many hats but um the last thing that I would want is someone to have an easier job and make more by traveling five miles away or two miles away to go to another community so I'm for this and I will be more than happy to vote on budget amendment whenever that time comes it's absolutely necessary we have any other coms Mr Robert you have last I say it's time to vote all right would you please call the RO council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis I Mr Reaper you are authorized to proceed please tell your staff that this Council greatly appreciates all their hard work yeah I do thank you sir item 16 consideration a second addendum to employment contract for the services of Kyle reer as city manager at the city of Belair Beach uh City attorney MOA is here thank you uh Mr Mayor again this was done um in response to discussion held at our last work session um the general discussion contemplated a potential um function salary renegotiation with the manager or additional um salary compensation what you have before you is a template um that reflects what it would look like were you to agree to a salary adjustment of proposed language and and in what that addendum would be the blanks are blanks because there was not a substantive discussion about the figure um as amounts to a negotiation of sorts um I did not want to put you at any one figure based on you know any idea of mine or any single council member and so um I believe this measure is is more better understood as Mr Banker's than mine as I believe he uh initially proposed it so with that I would yield except to state that you have language here that we would conform to whatever uh this Council agre should reach an agreement thank you mror let's go to the C for comment any like to com see there no citizens would like to comment on this we're going to clst Citizen comments and Council I need a motion to proceed with the second agenda motion motion made by Frank Banker May a second anyone like to Second this at this stage you're just seconding the discussion not not a second that uh to approve the final document right correct did I have a second okay second Mr Roberts Mr Baker do you have the floor well first of all I want to thank Rene for giving us all the work or the research that you did and I was alarmed a little bit when I saw any insurers currently offering an inter interm manager position at 13649 we only PID Kyle 11 15 I believe so Kyle's actually been doing this job in my opting for three years about March he's well underpaid and if I was him if I didn't get some kind of a buff I'd have my resume set that IND thean shes tonight so in order to be good business people and reward our city manager who dedicates 247 was I think at $138,000 salar is very acceptable Mr Banker could you repeat that please 138,000 138 uh just for the record we also budget $180,000 when we're out looking for a city manager so we're still well below that Mark and if you look at De Beach 140 and Rock Beach 159 uh we are still very very Council may I ask a point of order here in that I understand that the city manager's salary will be a public record but are the discussions normally held in public and certainly before the candidate yes short answer um all of this is not it is in fact public record it's a your question is well placed let me start from there your question is well placed but um salary discussions uh for even were I to come to you with a proposed amended contract for attorney terms um all of that is and all of that is uh takes place in the public because it's an official act uh which the Sunshine Law requires that any official Act of this body happen the public the added complicating layer here is uh the position of city manager regardless of whether it's talking about my Kyle or anybody else is a charter position there are three positions in the city that you folks directly supervise that's myself the clerk and the manager and so those discussions happen in the open and should we ever come to the unfortunate place where you desire to have those positions vacated uh that would also happen in the public um I think your Charter might have some procedure set forth but generally speaking all of that is in the public and and I can and I I appreciate that question and I want to make sure we keep an eye on questions like that um um with with all respect to Miss Rose as she's starting in this position she has Decades of experience as a clerk in another state and even as we've started to handle some of the public records requests coming in there's things that in Florida are open record and in other states are not and so navigating that um it's it's totally normal for it to sort of rub up against sensibilities but yes that happens in the public we don't have the ability to tell Kyle must leave um during that discussion or that he should be excluded from the public he than thank for that clarification I'm a little bit taken a back because we didn't talk about amounts before and I think all of us here are incredibly pleased with Kyle's performance and feel that he's IM qualified with his position and and very very impressed frankly with his the way he's navigating through this and the breath of his knowledge so all of that's very good I think the fact that Indian Shores may be an outlier in terms of the size of the community and the amount of the pay there um and I was just going to try to run a number and math is not my thing so my slow and pulling up my calc but it seems to be a fairly large increase in a single amount um and there were negotiations for this position initially um it was an agreeable point at that we're off schedu with that it's it's an acceleration of um a pay raise again fully support fund is a question of they thank Mr Roberts I think there's possibly two additional columns on this chart that that would help me and Randy talked about some scenarios with the city clerk but if I knew how much experience these existing city managers had with the city that they're currently the city manager in addition to how many years experience they've had as a city manager in total because they could have had 15 years different city albe it it could be different if they came from South Dakota because of the different rules and regulations there but it would still be they sat in a position and worked a position as a city manager somewhere else that type of thing prob brings a lot of value because he's been with the city not long in the city manager position but in a previous position where he's had an opportunity to learn about our city know our citizens and and know the things that are that have been challenges to our city so that's very Val but those those two additional columns would help me and I think K as well when we're seeing these numbers that somebody may have you know 185,000 and old that's a much bigger city Madera Beach 140,000 perhaps they've been in that position for 15 years I have no idea and maybe prior to that 10 years in another city but when we're just trying to bring it down to Apples to app any additional information like that I think helps us understand where ky's number needs to be yeah if my math is correct that's an 18% increase and Kim that did bring up another valid point which is we discussed this number uh way back when and it was agreed upon in the contract form and Frank also brought of the rout point there was another individual that we were willing to pay a significantly higher number um which means we do have money in the budget U for Kyle's scenario as well as some of those other positions that we talked about earlier so it's always a tough choice and decision Kyle's doing a great job I don't know what the magic number is well it seems to me that 18% is a one heck of a pay increase um at my family's company uh we did recognize that there was issues uh with with what we were paying U inflation housing fuel many factors that we looked at and for the good ones uh I think the largest salary we G an employe was a 10% raise in one year uh I I don't think I've ever given anyone an 18% raise in one wack um so I calculated at 10% the salary increase to uh to become 1265 that's what I calculated on but I'm uh open to other suggestions it's not this is just we're debating on if I can mention one thing belir Bluffs they took the I think it was 2020 they took the city clerk and advanced her into the city administrator manager or whatever uh gave her a b and I think she was underpaying it when she was a city clerk um so that's the lowest table on there at 126,000 everything else is well well above that um like I said we budgeted 180,000 I think Kyle's worth 180,000 we I should say shouldn't say I would never propose that because I think's worth it but whatever you want to you have a number Mr Mayor more well that was the number that that I was suggesting was 126.5 I can age with that so that's 10% 10% that's 10% and it puts it in line with B gloves um I our much smaller neighbor but oh no I'm sorry Bella L not B Shore Excuse me yes which is a community that has retail honors um which is something that we don't hear have here I think um a 10% raise um is competitive and certainly jus you agree yes all right Mr Bora on the contract the addendum it should State $16,500 and Mr Mayor members of the council um there is a second placeholder establishing when um that amount should take effect whether it is retroactive to a certain date or beginning on a certain date um you can see that in the parentheses and made be proceeding in 2024 at the end a how do you wish to I would imagine effective immediately all right I to confirm can you just restate one more time for the record the salary amount $126,500 understood Council all right so going have to take a roll call vote on this one I'm just going to keep it going all night this is to create a second addendum increasing the city manager's year yearly salary to $26,500 youe call the RO council member bankard I I'm sorry to interrupt just before we begin I want to be very clear procedurally this will't come back to you you've already seen the document so we will if this is approved we will memorialize it execute it without further thank you council member bankard yes council member Roberts I council member Shaw Elliot yes mayor gtis I congratulations Mr reer Mr MOA please proceed with second thank you thank you yes thank you count very well lunch is on fire tomorrow item number 17 authorization of a soul Source purchase of a wo was stock 24in valve for Street and drainage improvements Project B 23-01 Mr thank you mayor this is a uh Soul Source purchase it is a Lao uh check valve uh this is when we first started looking to check valves there are a lot of different models this is a newer more Innovative model than some of the ones that were done in the past if you remember the duck flap um or sorry the duck the duck mouth ones or the flap u u mechanisms that often would uh get jammed up and Clos back all the way so um these AR perfect but they seem to perform a lot better than some of the earlier designs and uh we've been using them throughout the city the uh currently have 14 install that we maintain monthly um but this this particular one we go to the Swale outfall uh at Bayside Park and the streets that it affects is uh Cedar and Spruce which runs through the retention Pond up to the inlet at the S both of those streets so um again this is just a a soul Source a soul Source purchase um that uh per our purchasing procedures I need approval from Council and it is part of the stor Water Project thank you Mr citizens for comments for comments right C comments are closed going to need a motion to authorize this purchase motion made by Frank Baker and seconded by Mr Banker do you have the FL I really think this should been included item number 12 but a separate item it just works both of work together that's all I thank you Mr Banker any other comments questions I think on this one we can uh we can just do a voice a Voice vote uh this is authorize city manager to purchase from a soulle source for a 24in valve for Street and drainage improvements Project B 23-01 all in favor I I oppose Mr reer you are authorized to proceed thank you number 18 authorization to purchase an xmart laser Z 48 in mower this is placed on the agenda by city manager reer you mayor this is uh another uh purchase that is off of a state contract um the uh lawnmower is part of our Capital Equipment uh replacement plan um we each year in the budget save uh 5,000 over time we build it up and uh right now we're due to replace our 48 in Coral it's a 2012 Z master um so this is a comparable mower um we uh Community Services administrator Aaron glance he reached out to a lot of the Public Works departments throughout the county and asked uh just personal their personal opinion on what um newer model mowers have been working well with minimal repairs and uh the xar lasers Z came back U with great great reviews so um again this is a state contract that provides uh that was public bid and provides a 20% discount on the MSRP and um you know we're looking to purchase this from chuch Cho La equipment who we've done business with in the past Mr reer citizen comments all right we're back to the council we need a motion to authorize this purchase motion made by council member Elliot do I have a second second second Mr Robert M ellott you have the flo this seems to be normal uh equipment purchases um things wear out we had a 20 plus year old mower let's replace it other comments I I just had one question about the uh the sole source uh or not Soul Source but the uh because it's a state contract is it automatically the lowest price I know it says 20% off MSRP but normally MSRP is doesn't mean anything so my question is is should we have at least checked around to make sure that what is the best price I believe that every uh authorized dealer of the x mark uses the state state contracts and they all agree to an MSRP it's a set set price Statewide it is um it it it gets adjusted yearly depending on inflation um and do not think that if we went to each other authorized deal state that we would get a different price they've agreed on to a to a market price and it's provided off that state contract Mr Roberts yeah typically if you look at the state contracts I haven't seen this one specifically typically the languages in there that prevents the bid winner from selling it to anyone for a price lower than the price that at state so you could feel comfortable normally that that's that's a great price all right any other questions or comments no all right this is to authorize the city manager to purchase an xmart laser c48 in motor all in favor I any oppos Mr rther you are authorized to proceive thank you number 19 unfinished business any unfinished business just as a point of comment just a quick Google search the lower uh list at 12,999 so that would be 20% off of that any other unfinished business all right now we are on to item 20 which is city council comments this month we'll begin with council member Elliot oh wow I think we've accomplished a great deal tonight and uh prior week and I thank everybody for their cooperation and I certainly I I know he's left for the night but I uh give my sincere congratulations to um officer uh Shaw Roberts Robert Shaw excuse me um and I and I must say that I have encountered him just in my da walks throughout the community and I think he represents exactly what good public servants do he makes an effort to connect with people he's kind uh he knows the area and he certainly uh gave us all on that day and we thank him again great all right uh Mr Banker you're up um I'm sure uh the traffic will start increasing in the next couple weeks with the spring trading coming down here and everything like that we'll probably have a lot of problems with citizens not being able to get out their street but I think it's something you just have to bear with and that much we can do it happy birthday Babe Ruth 129 tomorrow Mr Roberts yeah very happy that we were able to move the um Street and drainage project along the way so hopefully we'll get them started as quickly as they possibly can we are familiar obviously with the hurricane season on June 1 that doesn't mean sometimes we actually have main hurricanes prior to that so it can happen um we hope we don't have any until August but that may or may not be the case so happy that that's moving along and it'll be enjoyable to see the improvements made and I know our citizens will enjoy that thank you thank you Mr Roberts as always I'd like to thank everyone who was here tonight one who watch get home I'd also like to take this moment to thank this Council for hanging in there not let the state run you off they tried but it didn't work um I appreciate your your patience I appreciate uh your your ability to remain calm even whenever we don't agree and uh I appreciate everyone having an open mind and being able work here I still think this is one of the best councils in Allis County I'm proud of everyone of so with that do I have a motion to adjourn motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor all right good night everyone thank you"
