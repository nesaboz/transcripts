citizens with us today so we're on to item number four um park and rec survey since nora wasn't gonna be with us today and we've had like you know last month we had a lot of cold yucky rainy windy days i decided to extend it one month so we can do all the recaps together when she gets back so we're gonna skip that for this month hopefully you got that email from i know you're having email problems so hopefully you saw that from patty i think i did okay i don't know i hope you weren't rushing around this morning trying to finish your surveys and stuff no i did mine last week oh okay yeah she sent it out like a while ago last time we had a meeting you said something about the ramp area was you've got the new specs on that and it's going to be go out to bed soon can i get a copy of what that's going to look like before i mean i had a bunch of comments but if they're all you know plans for their aunt yeah oh they could all be fixed and you don't need to say your comments is that what you mean well yeah if i make comments here that it needs to be decided and it's already it's already done yeah that's a good point do you want me to get it right now no but you know for next meeting just because or do you want to look at it before the next meeting i'd like to look at it before the next meeting but we don't have to run out and get it now just remind them okay okay um so item number five on the agenda the april 30th find me to the moon i presented it to city council last monday and it passed seven to zero so we are on um yay the contract has been signed um and insurance thank you kyle for doing that for the music and then nicole has secured an italian affair it's an italian food truck obviously and um the menu is as follows it's exactly what we were looking for and i know nicole worked really hard to find someone and lock it down and it's actually perfect so very happy about that um i'm happy too yeah so the music is all good that's taken care of music is taken care of and then i'm just waiting on the updated coi thing yeah oh yeah so he'll send that back to me like as soon as he like gets it and the menu is as follows for pizza slices they're gonna sell cheese pepperoni the works pepperoni rolls ham and sausage rolls garlic nuts and then drinks i'm assuming like fountain drinks or water or whatever i'm not really sure hope and then we're just waiting for him to give us pricing and then we'll get something um we'll put something on the board to say like see website for menu or something like that and i thought maybe if we even like printed out like even something like this with the menu and the pricing we can hand it to people when they get a bottle of water or we can just you know like have noise kids like last year they were so cute walking around passing stuff out we can have them pass out the menus to people since we'll have garbage and recycling out unless he has like a chalkboard that's you know you can see very clearly but i would like the pricing so people know walking in that it's like the setup is going to be the same as last time on the back patio kind of thing exactly the same okay i just have to ask too if um i would think he would accept cards but i'll double check credit cards yeah because if he's cash only then we would need to know which i don't think he is but i'll confirm he probably has a square but yeah that would be that's a good point who knows people go either way now so yeah i'll ask him really um nice man so happy he's gonna do it yes so which leads me to the next point like kyle got pricing for those um bellar beach drawstring sports packs that we were gonna give away but they're over four dollars each or no they're mo it's like 400 plus dollars yeah so they're a little pricey and it puts us over our budget so i wanted to bring up a point i don't know if we want to vote on it um but i i don't even know if we could do it like it's something that lynn would have to approve because we're going over our budget so i wanted to see what you guys thought of because our um we can't get the italian ice vendor so i thought an option instead of giving away the backpacks we can get mini cannolis from publix we can place an order we can get 200 of them for like 187 and we can give dessert away as opposed to giving away the backpacks and then also kyle mentioned it in our last meeting where the last park and rec board kind of put together a vintage car show that didn't really happen there's all kinds of stuff in the storage room so there's these lights and some cleaners and some towels and between them we should be able to put at least like everyone would get a towel or a light because we don't have enough and then you know one of these items which is like glass cleaner and multi-purpose armor all entire foam so we would put like little gift bags together with these because these are nice to have everybody would like these and it would get them out of the storage room so we're still we're still having giveaways they just don't say bellar beach but i want to get your thoughts on it are we planning to give away well a hundred is what we did last time okay so i'm i would get 200 cannoli because we're hoping for a bigger crowd and then once obviously that's done that's done and then for these it's still good whenever we run out whenever we run out okay and i think we have enough to make 75 to 100 gift bags of these so you know what though like last time we gave everybody a koozie like it would really only be one per household for these like you don't need to give one to the husband and one to the wife if they're together like we did the koozies it would just be like one per family and they'll go further if that makes sense yes but i mean we i would love to have open discussion because um i don't know if we want to try to find another dessert vendor to sell or something else to give away i think the cannoli idea is a great idea okay what's the minimum of the bags like what is the minimum order has to be placed that's only a hundred that's the rate in a hundred and if you get less it goes up so you're getting less than you're still paying the same price i was just seeing like about like selling them but i guess not that i asked him about that um tote or something like you know like those fabric bags with the like embroidery that would go off the charts just saying no no how about after the tiles are gone yeah okay i mean that's fine maybe we do those for the fall event because they all have more time they're just like like cute and if the towels fit in there i don't know it's just an idea no i like it i know the merchandise but it's nice to have i'm not in all lynn's approval i know i'm just teasing um but if because i mean i don't i know it's not like next weekend but i feel like we're kind of close on this like if we're gonna order anything it has to be ordered like now so i just don't feel like we should like pressure if if everybody likes the cannoli idea and we're going to give away this stuff yeah yeah oh that's fine we've had there for a while yeah they've had this in the back for a couple of years so it would be nice to you know and people would like it you know they would yeah and then so that leads me to okay so if you look at the budget okay so the um the entertainment is 800 that's locked in the water and ice we have a hundred hundred for 200 people which you know hopefully we have that or more we can always run to publix and get more um the security is still the same okay so we can't have a 50 50 raffle and we already have the decor so i was wondering with that hundred dollars it won't cost this much but i saw these little like bags with music notes on it this stuff definitely won't fit in there but i just thought like little gift bags with handles we we could get that at like the dollar store or something to put this stuff in i mean i don't want to just be like here you go i would like to have it at least yeah a little bit nicer especially you know i just so if we could use that hundred dollars to get like plain they don't even have to be fancy just gift bags to put this in um what do you guys think of that yeah that's fine i mean it can't be rolling around the grass out there so yeah yeah something and it's i don't want to put it in a publix bag that's like cheesy like um i know what you're talking about and i think what i would check with i don't see i don't know because you need to do it i know you guys need to handle it but like maria orders two sizes of brown bags and she probably gets them in bulk and i could you know probably get them from her at a better price than even the dollar store maria maria is the person i run my skincare suite from but she's got boxes of the exact bags that i'm thinking of so i would just see like where she gets them and how much she pays that would be like a good indicator for like what we should be paying because i i mean if we could get them like for under 50 cents a piece or i don't i don't want to get them on amazon too okay yeah we'll we'll price them out and i know how much you're actually saving because yeah just depends yeah it's a big amount and yeah but if it's not that much so just kidding on amazon so we could put that the 50 50 i mean i don't think we still have all the decor from last year i and all of it's still good i don't know why we would go buy anything different yeah i forgot didn't you say you had some uh italian game decor because we've had italian themed parties but it's all there do we need anything to kind of really bring out the difference well you know what would be cute is like if we did red checkered tablecloths for the um but see like everything else though the signs that we already have made up the tents they're all in the bellar beach blue and pink so i don't know like maybe for the cannoli table we get a red and white checkered tablecloth like and that would be more we could use that for the water but like the little things add to the difference yeah no that's that's a good idea and um i'll look i'll do a little research and see what i can find that will pop and you know we might not want to use like we can still use the musical instruments for decor and the white but we probably don't want to use the black and the purple we would want to use red and green and white yeah so okay so i'll look at that too i probably have an italian party pack decorations for like 20 boxes so you get all these you guys are gonna dress up like that right like italian like mario luigi you know i have uh yeah i have like chef italian chef hats and aprons like when we did our um okay what was it called bring bring your own balls it was a meatball party and everybody made their own meatballs and like i had my judges literally dressed head to toe like italian chefs they were it was really cute and they had their clipboards and they were going around eating all the meatballs but i don't have anything at all yeah yeah i'm sorry um you know what though tim is going there maybe i'll see if he can bring some of the tablecloths back stuff that'll fit into his backpack he'll be appreciative of that um okay so and then the signage i know kyle you want to put together like a um and you know last time like when you did the halloween signs the orange you couldn't read it when you were driving so maybe stick to the black lettering yeah because the orange was it was cute i'll put something together and then it was hard but i'll stay away from colors that are harder to see okay like red you'll be able to see black you'll be able to see and you'll be able to do a cute italian theme i'm really bummed we can't use the the girl with the pizza slice well if i can find something similar it's just you know with the copyrights no i got you and then you want to sketch your own no and nicole if you can find out because it said drinks if you can find out what he has for drinks if he gives you pricing it'll say but i don't know if it's coke or pepsi or um yeah it's probably like cans yeah yeah let him know that we're going to be giving away water i mean he can have it if you know we run out but if we're giving it out people aren't going to buy it what'd we say the time was on this 4 30 to 7 30. and then like i'm gonna look through my notes but just off the top of my head like when i went back through okay after the jazz in the park we talked about okay what would we do different what would we do better and one was like make announcements and say thank yous and i don't have a problem doing that like but that day i just felt like we were running around with chickens with their heads cut off trying to decorate and do all that stuff like right before so it never even dawned on me so like we'll have something prepared in advance to say um even if it's just to say thank you to the food truck and to you know announce what they have or whatever the case may be announced the band maybe we will have our new mayor say a couple of words when the band takes a break um but we'll plan something because like that was one thing i thought we were missing last time and then my other question for you is did you like the merchandise table right up there was it loud i mean i know i was up there selling a couple times but like overall was it cramped or crowded or loud with the music or were you fine it was perfect right there yeah okay i'd rather be under the cover than like oh and deal with the music corralled in there locked in yeah and i had this stuff on the the benches so it was good too you had a nice little cubby and that was a good display that we had and like i'll get some you know how we had the the i got pink and colorful ones last time i'll get some red and green and i have a red green and white clips for like to show the um merch can anybody think of anything else that we um i bet you my notes are right in here but i'm not going to dig through this pile right now um things that we would do differently from the jazz fest to translate into we have two tents now so now you know we didn't have it at jaztime we have a tent for the um the water table and the community table so we'll probably give the cannoli away at the water table we'll just keep that together and um i don't know like the community where would they be at the entrance to the pen probably right remember last year we moved him like six times you may have gone left to go get donna we moved those tables so many times and i think where we landed was good and it's around the same time i know it's a different time of year so we might have to play with it but like the food truck was here if you remember the italian ice and the water and the community table were kind of right across and then the middle was open and that worked out well as long as we have like it's good that we have two tents this time because it was blazing hot like if you weren't under a tent i don't remember but i don't think the tents last time had any labels on or any signage or anything like that no because my neighbor bought that yeah like we didn't have any tents and she was boiling so they ran home and got it for us thank you scotty and land uh but this year you know we we bought them for they're about the color she had an umbrella i'm sorry we're just good oh i don't remember oh we bought them for the halloween thing yeah so we have two blue ones aren't they like the color of your shirt they're tense aren't they blue yeah so that they're we ordered them from amazon so they're definitely not logoed or anything um no i just well i don't know if do we want to put some signage on well we have a signage on the table that is underneath the tent so like we could possibly move the signage up if that would make it easier to read it might be easier just in general fasten fasten it to the tent close them or mess with the table things yeah probably work better yeah we can move the signage up to the tent i'm just trying to that's kind of the corrections for people oh oh there's the second steps yeah and you know i maybe a lot of times they would look up before they would look down so we'll definitely that's a good idea we'll move the signs but they're already made and we're going to use what we have and they match perfect so i know they're not italian theme but that's okay yeah they're generic they're good for everything yeah okay and and what was the resolution on the sign like the digital sign we're putting it on there or we're not putting it on there we are yeah yeah we're not gonna do the big banner we're gonna do put it on the side yeah keep it on the side like we do can you put it up like three weeks in advance yeah and then can you put something about um see bellar beach website for menu or something we'll have to figure out what we're gonna put up okay there's if you put it in space you don't wanna overload it yeah but we want to make sure we guide people where they can get more or maybe just yes see see our website for details yeah and then we'll lay it out on there okay yeah because they still want to make sure they know like you know they need to bring like their their chairs and their umbrellas and their coolers yeah all those little details look good on the website okay okay you try to kind of write up everything for the digital patty oh yeah yeah i'll let you um proof it and see if i need to add anything um the only thing that i um don't want to do and like last year it said because the name of the band is still the jazz fools but like they have a singer that wasn't there last time that does all of the frank sinatra rat pack so i don't want to put the sorry i don't want to put the band's name because then it sounds like it's a jazz band no yeah we're just going because we put it on everything last time we're not going to do that this time because i don't technically know if they change their name with a different singer but sure we're just going to leave it yeah they won't care um we have two more meetings before this event we're gonna have our next regular meeting which if we keep it where we normally have it will be wednesday april 13th at 2 o'clock and then we're going to do as we normally do before an event the friday before which is the 29th at 2 o'clock we'll come in here for setup and like last time i think wasn't there a wedding or something on friday so we couldn't put stuff up or did we not put it up because we were afraid it would blow away i can't remember blowing them away okay yeah yeah the only thing that was a pain i'll leave it up a whole night you know just because someone could mess with it anything could happen to her yeah the biggest pain was hanging those poof balls from the rafters and they were cute but like what stuck out were the music notes and maybe we just put something italian if we get some italian flags or whatever it is on the beams and then we don't need a ladder we're not dealing with string we're not trying to make it we're lucky to have we had to take it out for a while we're lucky to have help yeah and by the time it started we were all sweating and frazzled so it's like if we could make that go a little smoother because i think i ran up and down that hill about 150 times that day it's like boom boom boom boom boom so it's like yeah if we you know i think we may have learned a little bit so this one should be easier so but we do have two meetings beforehand and if you guys think of anything in the middle like you wake up in the middle of the night george and this great idea comes to you just email it to patty and she'll send it out to us so we can start working on it before call patty immediately call patty immediately disseminate the information at my age i'm up most of the night anyways just email it so the first meeting is going to be the 13th of april yeah if that's good for everybody i'm going to have her email it out like she normally does i expect to get a birthday card is that your birthday yeah oh nice how about a birthday cake i'm gonna be an old man i don't know man how would we be i think i 78 you don't know but somewhere around there um yeah so if you think of anything other than that that we've talked about or like you have a great idea for like something italian that would you know be easy um but make a pop and you want us you know to research pricing or if you have pricing just send it to patty and then she'll disseminate it out to all of us and um because you know we have a basically a month and a half um yeah look on amazon we found it pretty easy and cheap yeah and i might come in if anybody wants to you don't have to like the thursday before and put gift bags together because trying to put gift bags together and decorate and put the tables together on friday afternoon will be too much i think um like in the last time we did gift bags for halloween we it didn't take us any time at all i mean it was like we just laid out all the bags and shoved stuff in there and it was good so it shouldn't be too too long but um okay car wash bag sample signage and then we're still going to be cash only for the merchandise table okay it was more of a question and kyle shook his head yes okay perfect um all right does anybody have anything else to add to that topic all good okay next item merchandise inventory a new order so i took inventory before our meeting today we have one pink ladies t-shirt an extra large we have one large pink tank top and two medium pink tank tops and that's it for the women and then for men's we have nine light blue two xl's so i think i guess normal likes to excel see before we needed them and we didn't have them oh i guess we got them now so we'll see if who who pops up at the event but um so nicole and kyle are gonna figure out and go next week to mary mouse and put an order together and you guys do whatever you want like we don't need to we trust you do anything you know okay oh brother i mean if you want t-shirts or tank tops or um what color i mean it doesn't matter they all sell we've had like six or seven different colors and they all sold we had gray and dark blue and light blue and pink and yellow and peach and summer yeah that's why it's good she's going with you and then everything just has to be logo no date logo no date five times 105 and in writing and we shouldn't i mean nothing should be upcharged this time because we don't need any 2xl um we didn't get two xl's in women's right no it's only up to xsl i think but that would only be for like the tanks because the um but those women's fitted tank either t-shirts they're not very big yeah like they don't look like the men's 2xls they're like the fourth of the size of those t-shirts so it's like i like the shirt that i bought that remember like the green one yeah like because you guys saw the same shirt yeah it was like really soft although george i've never seen you wear yours but it's green so you can wear it to this and it will go with the theme i'm worried i've never seen you here around the house um okay that's fine yeah what's the budget for that do you have a budget no no well you have to order the minimum so there's no i mean oh 30 t-shirts so we were always getting like um 15 and 15 but like because we have four women's and nine men's you might skew a little bit more towards them yeah ladies yeah and obviously the men's you know you know it's like just get like maybe four mediums hardly no smalls and the rest in large large an extra large yeah and then the women's same thing like they're made real small and so we have some mediums and larges i mean just use your best judgment and vary it yeah and there's not a whole lot we can do because we don't know who's showing up yeah we gotta analyze the actual shirt we're buying this time yeah and make sure they have an inventory because that's usually a problem okay so whatever they have there i'll just pick out right off the show yeah so thank you in advance for doing that that's always fun you gotta make sure he has enough of the prince too because he ran out of those last times the other brother yeah i'm just kidding just give us bel air beach right across done i'm just kidding he doesn't have it so are we only going to have t-shirts and towels at this event to sell you don't want to get koozies or stickers or we have license plates too what about the hats yeah we got to sell the slices yeah you guys always had hats that wasn't us no i know what about like black and white black and white hats black hats with our logo on it would look really cute the white would be a lot of white but the black would be sharp where do they come from"
