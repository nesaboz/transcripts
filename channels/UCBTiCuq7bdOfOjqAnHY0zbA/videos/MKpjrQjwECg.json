    "transcript": "good evening good evening everyone today in June the 19th 2023 and is at the City Council budget workshop for the city recording in progress please uh arrives and told me in the Pledge of Allegiance thank you again um vice mayor Jody Shirley your mayor Dave gathers city manager Kyle riefler um Heather guadali yeah and council member of Belinda Livingstone was unable to attend she should come in on Zoom Right Center in relationship she was okay she whenever she shows up okay see that there's a box on the screen here I'm just going to walk over and get rid of it says got it are you going to do that thank you I didn't want it to be recorded period all right we have one agenda item started up like a 35 mayor Shirley we're chairing for the last week did a great job so that being said let's move right into item number one discussion and review of fiscal year 2023-2024 budget I hope everyone brought their draft budgets that were delivered to their homes will be before over to Mr replay thank you mayor so we're first budget workshop and the next question Workshop we're going to have is going into July 17th and at that budget Workshop was nowhere except the alternative military the the property values came back and estimated from the property appraiser that 10.64 percent increase in our current our current military of 2.034 10 so the revenues of one on page four there's one change I need to make from this graphics at the license and registration for the rental property registrations we dropped that down assuming that the statute of State bill was going to pass but it didn't so our rental registration be able to stay the same so that's what we can change Kyle can I ask you a favor right quick we're probably going to be jumping around a little bit and uh and just to help everyone here whenever you change page or change subject you let us know what page you're on just in case okay um and I met a lot of you individually and what I did um through all the uh the uh operating accounts in departments is really kind of getting closer to what we're spending and our exposures um and also on the revenue side of the general fund um I bumped things up quite a federal registration in the uh facility rentals for the weddings it came up today where I moved it on page five um we're we're making more money than we're budgeting so we pushed it up slightly but it could probably go a little high um it came up to the question of where we're at today on the rentals and right now for wedding rentals we're at about 21k [Music] um for the uh hello one second Miss Livingstone has joined the meeting thank you can you hear us okay I can hear you but for some reason my video is not working I apologize okay okay um [Music] so the total battles right now we're at about 35 000 um a year Revenue right now we're Bud hitting uh 24 000 so that could creep up a little bit more um and then uh like I said like when we go through the expenditures for the Departments um I got them all linear relied on them I'm tired to what we're spending and that was from all of mine from last year's budget and uh when I met with me individually we kind of went through each teach help plan um I'd like to get to one of the major points page 15 which is the sanitation department that is our Waste Management contract we have uh representative management seven dollars in the audience tonight and uh he's here to answer any questions um right now our contract is expiring um this September for the five-year term we have the option to renew but he's predicting higher increase in prices 25 percent is the number I was getting we have the option to renew with them under the new pricing or people at the RFP like we did in 2018 but that is uh that's something he came in to answer any questions you have Council first question is going to be we have a four percent Gap what up Mr wrinkler this is something that we've done um addendums every year on the contract there is a four percent cap last year we had to go out more than that uh based on an operating crisis the their labor their material cost um something that we've we've adjusted every year I think it'd be a good idea and buy Mr Bowers up to the podium and uh and that way the council can just ask questions correctly okay thank you for joining us Bishop hours thank you good evening mayor vice mayor council members I'm Tim Bowers the governmental Affair manager for Waste Management I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening please allow me to begin by thanking all of you for your support we've had a long solid relationship with Bel Air Beach over the last 20 years things are going on the salt waste industry is experiencing Market reset as are other Industries labor operating costs continue to rise and are out producing price adjustments I think we've all seen inflationary pressures whether it's buying groceries gas Municipal Services garbage trucks Rising costs and the impact on the solid waste industry is affecting everyone and everyone in our industry but things were receiving drastic increases in the price of steel steel is used to make trucks deals used to make the containers that we use the metal containers from my labor costs the labor costs are up and we've had to raise our wages we also had to raise our benefits and we've also had to hire additional HR resources to keep prospecting for new folks that that we need in the operation again fuel cost everybody knows what's happened with gas prices and fuel on diesel fuel and then maintenance and truck parts to keep the trucks running we've had to increase our rates now and due to these unforeseen unprecedented market conditions which the city were Waste Management could not anticipate at the time of our contract uh what was executed in 2018 and the continuation of these employees inflationary pressures we will have to make that ask for a price increase a significant price increase Waste Management estimates that are contract renewable rates will increase markedly to better keep Pace with the operating cost and critical services in your community we're estimating a price increase not necessarily a price increase but a new contract price for a contract renewal estimated 25 percent I know that that's that's a lot that's tough and that's why I'm here to talk to you folks about it let me know this is where this is where waste management is we would welcome the opportunity to discuss exercising a renewal option with our current event uh Mr reefer uh we can explore options that may reduce costs we'd have to talk to find out what there might be again we welcome that opportunity um there are intentional benefits of renewing the contract with Waste Management here in Bel Air we're a North American company the largest provider in North America with 4 500 employees and 17 000 trucks and we have global resources throughout the United States but we're local here we're in Clearwater that's where our trucks come out of we appreciate your business and hope to continue our partnership I'd like to thank you for considering our request here I'd be willing to take any questions if we have uh yes uh first of all Kyle is deic 24.5 increase is that factoring in the uh the letter from Waste Management yes that is it's our last contract uh it was at a 330 000 so that's today at 25 increase in Freedom of the 413 000. okay so now the question is going to go right to the we have a franchise agreement with a four percent cap when does that agreement expire do you have an option to renew for five years foreign the coming years no we have to negotiate that okay thank you Mr Banker probably um I figure we get about 100 pickups a year because we get to pick up one Monday Thursday we get just about every holiday unless the land because it was close I think last year we got 100. knock that down because I'm figuring the pickups that you're charging us right now or three thousand three hundred fifty four dollars approximately a pickup it's going to be increased with that 41.77 4200 on the holidays I'm sure you're paying your guys double time triple time um okay plus a holiday or just my mom a holiday shirt yeah plus the holiday too so what I'm saying is that figure now goes to six thousand sixty five hundred if we not go off like six of those holidays that would bring a single about 36 000 savings is that correct enough well we we would take a look at it but uh we could put a pencil to it one time one time a week collection what time a week I'm just saying eliminate the holidays we get a hundred I think we had one maybe two not pickups because the way if it was closed I think January 1st this year traveling the money is going to pick up so we had to pick up on Thursday so we got credit on that I don't know if there was another one so I'll just calculate about a hundred whether you're about another four to six holidays that we also get picked up because uh not picking up in those days just a reminder too is we have Wednesday through cycle day so that's another so we have really ever get the service three days and I'm just curious how everyone feels about producing their coverage I've always been amazed that that we did we had garbage makeup on holidays and I always thought that that was kind of weird at times I was grateful how many cargo was in the house after that this morning but uh but still I I was always a little amazed that we were offered that service I will come in Waste Management [Music] um you've got us a phenomenal you pick up just about anything your guys are friendly they do a great job I don't see later scattered around the cans whenever they're emptying them I think they're phenomenal so I hope that we can Encompass some sort of an agreement and continue the using your services it doesn't work out it doesn't work out but I will say that you guys do a great job I realize I realize this is a big ass we put the pencil to it we're under all these pressures of inflation and everything going on buying all of the things the supplies and messes that there are things that we need and that's why I wanted just to come and talk to you today to let you know that we're looking at that's a ballpark figure because we realize that you couldn't go out the bin if you want to go out for bid but kind of want to engage whether you wanted to continue to negotiate if you were thinking about you know doing it Council Mr table brief question maybe out of it what was your annual profit last year I think probably 18 20 somewhere in there I'm talking Millions right how many millions were a 20 billion dollar Corporation yeah and you're we're getting at 25 hit that's a big ask okay you guys own the landfill that we do no we eat everything we take goes to Pinellas County Mr Roberts if you have a question I do for uh Kyle so Kyle you said 2018 and 2019 that time frame is when we initiated the current contract that we're under correct yes 18 okay at that time did we go out to bid yeah we did okay and that was pre-covered correct yes okay so so this four percent uh cap that was placed we had no idea what the market was going to do I would say that that is probably fair to ask for an increase but I don't know if 25 is uh is in our wheelhouse but I'm also wondering if it's negotiable on the cap going forward um Americans are starting to cool some and uh and maybe if we were to swallow some of this and say okay here's our new rate but maybe our camp is a little bit lower than where it is now um we can talk about other things other things to consider I think um probably is is a fair statement say we'd like to see you sharpen your pencil and as noted the mayor said of course they're coming down last year the diesel fuel close to six months ago and now it's 4 25. this material if you have a question just the comment I would be in favor of negotiating with Waste Management in the city and waste management giving what they can give they've been a wonderful service to us for years I would like to keep any other questions or comments of hours I have one additional question you indicated that there were maybe some cost savings approaches was that just to cut service is that a family way to save costs is there something else that you have actually did that was that was one but we could also look at you know if there's a possibility of doing something with with the routing of the idea of the holidays came up that we could we would entertain too so there might be once we start to set down the clock there may be some other opportunities there that could work out the deal okay uh I guess um I mean I don't think we could first of all want to agree with everything the mayor said I've only been here four years and the service that you guys provide is often sharp the staff that you have that work for you are amazing that being said I think from our perspective I would have a difficult time answering the questions somebody confronted me constituated and said well gee whiz why didn't we put this out of a bit that doesn't mean we're necessarily constrained to take a little bit I hope you have a lot of experience and knowledge of what you guys have done for the city but I think at the same time it would be in the city's best interests if we did go out the bed and received how many bids how many companies bid the last time I was curious we're about five okay so we would have an opportunity to review those and evaluate again I've been involved before with kids and you don't always select the lowest bid I mean I take this from my own projects at my house I don't always pick a little spit there's a lot of other factors that melt into that I think it would be a good test to see where the market is sure just the insanity channel right I would still Kyle win when do we need to make this decision whether we move forward or putting out for bed uh pretty soon because if you don't want to at least be stab advertise for a month um so I had to be able to put together and get it in the paper it would be in the next council meeting the next regular council meeting or is it that would be okay yeah okay all right well um my recommendation would be to um I would like to give Mr Bowers the opportunity just to see what Wiki something that we can look at as uh maybe a middle of the road kind of thing and if we don't like it or we feel like maybe we would probably need to do with Bishop Roberts suggested and put it out for basically I would I'd still like to give a waste management Waste Management the opportunity to stay on if possible everybody okay with that yes Mr Reaper yes thank you very much Mr Bowers I appreciate you coming out thank you I'm going to get back to I don't really make contracts we have a law enforcement contract um increase [Music] Tyler um [Music] we're not ready to move on okay this is uh I know I asked this question earlier and I even went pretty up with voicemail from here but what is the cost for services per month per resident container they have but what is it currently and what would it be at the 25 increase because I think you said that we're charging a little more than what yeah so um right now pretty cool I think they charge 48 airports situation to give that number and right now with our brand new um our actual personal Revenue sort or Garbage Collection is 342 000. so it's higher than what the 330 or 325 that our current contract is a [Music] so I'll buy monthly for residents for a single family home our fan 48 dollars myself okay please continue thank you okay so the law enforcement contracts is going up by the 7.94 bridge okay and then the code enforcement contract that hourly rate is going off the southern so when I budgeted it was the four percent the lowering the hours of dollars per week which was at 33 000. it'll be more closer to 34700. 750 dollars but I think since the last year we budgeted 20 hours per week we started off the whole election year and 15 hours he was working three five-hour days and I feel that um he could work three to four hour days a minute okay so come sorry so back back to the law enforcement real quick what would they just did 23 24b so if you look at the departmental for that there's ten thousand dollars for additional um d so um this year's contract was 549 000 and if this year we'll go up to 592 000 and change plus to 10 000 so you didn't use any of that this year but that would be if you if you did something [Music] um some kind of specials until or just in trap or something where we requested an extra service or an extra.e working okay thank you um could you repeat what you said 592 yes 586. yeah so that that is um that's the first group that's a draft of the budget before I got the actual number so that's it for five percent increase plus the 10 000 for the additional um supplemental policy so the next time you see a draft of the budget we'll have the the 592.50 any questions on the law enforcement or code of the first one word dial or the proposal is to dial back and services so the number of hours you were reducing by Kyle that we talked about this morning okay yeah so last year's budget would be at 20 hours per week we didn't use that this year or I'll propose to become all the way down to 12 hours a week okay okay got a lower hourly to come out in Code Enforcement relates to the full-time position in the non-departmental for the admin assistant for the proposing and that would be we had it in there for a part-time 20-hour release position 18 per hour and what you'll see on Facebook there's like what it would cost for eighteen dollars per hour for full time I like the point now we change 21 in the United States projects that is the replacement police got an increase when you're at 3 500 per year I increase service just stay on track with the replacement on page 23 that draft shows the computer hardware software continuing to be saved [Music] proposing that with the 13 positive that we have for a good um where we don't need the years [Music] getting into the capital for all this um page 38. that street resurfacing then it shows the the note the one who got into this year 526 200 is a portion of the Loom is going to say the street or service saying then we're spending it in the top in 2024 that's 617 and you'll see the same relation for these worksheets for in the storm water but in Starbucks [Music] and it's just each portion of the low and we estimated that both better I emailed it all of you an analysis of the issues we're headed to program a percentages in how we're going to attract interest s and then Capital fund page 45 replaced in Sea walls the next email is going to be replaces in South Park but in this current Year's budget in 2025 I wrote I raised the rate of 20 if [Music] pull them back there that's not the immersion um starts on page 47. go to California we're currently from our Sopranos we increase the rain current of the resolution that we passed a couple of years back our current stuff that we always protected thousand if someone Improvement plan project is for the doc improvements we currently have and that's Facebook if you want we currently have 52 000 standard dub and we've been saving at a rate of 7 500 per year um with the the 50 of the islands in the Miranda look and um going through miles a bit to replace they came back in seventy thousand dollar Mark um we don't quite have that same yet but I propose that we at least raise it up for 10 000 per year to stay a little bit more aggressively before replacement page 55 in the solar water fun again that is the valley curve you know see the capital of no revenue and then the projects before and then same same type of situation in the store water improvements because with our loan yeah um we got our Capital [Music] um and then for all the projects will be done in 2024. thank you generally touches on all the main changes coming up is there any questions on what I talked about Council questions regarding storm water currently we have we're charging a maintenance fee to the residents can we get some look at what that looks like and does that feeding need to be adjusted any for the out years you know as we continue to we do all these improvements but do we have the budget to maintain forward yeah um right now we're current unit so her combo unit per single family home whether our assessment is 15 dollars so thirty dollars by monthly and that the actual that comes in is that 177 000 um historical water assessments the if you look at our [Music] with our stormwater projects um the Valley curtain replacements much lower than what the is needed to balance that but one thing that keeps going on every year is the fair size 38 46 fresh 460 the installing the rate of repairs motor maintenance that increased because if you look in the budget in last year's budget I worked at least spending much more and then that's when we go and we get a Barnacle oyster build up with a pipes you have to clean the chip back them out and also open the pipes started failing and we have to line them some of some of these problems people get taken care of as we move through with our projects in the different streets that we're doing but there's also going to be um you know a lot of types of Bayshore cleaned out on a regular basis only 12 inches they tend to accumulate an article sprinkly um so that's the price I mean I've noticed it just the years I've been here with some little stuff in that company that we use but their pricing is all kind of increased sort of everything else so would it be fair to ask for a budget at least for the Barnacle removal what that looks like for a big city staff does that and then I don't know how often you have to hire an outside service to do additional work but at least see what that looks like for City staff and make sure that we're we're at least getting enough to offset those costs so the city staff goes through and they're building out it's on a monthly basis they go through to each one of those one-way check valves and they you know go down the street from articles often so they continue to function anything that gets accumulated in the pipes which is more on pipes that cannot have valves on them because the environment is still into them that has to be contracted out um for you know the truck and the blades the blessing out we'll talk about understanding partly you just want to you want to explore the idea of making sure that the storm water assessment revenue is enough to cover that ongoing repair and maintenance the maintenance yeah because obviously you can see that the 170 775 a year is not going to pay for your big project that's why I had to take on all that debt right right surprise is the cleaning of the valves is that that's basically in the operating expense is that correct yeah that gets broken up the way it works is the Public Works employees by 85 percent of their personal services is in the public works department and then 15 of it it's moved over to the storm water fund [Music] okay so right now that's something we said when we started the assessment the number of 15 of their time who's dedicated to the storm water so that's like that's a ratio any other questions just a general question where is the line item that shows our our mortgage payment for this foreign costs it's on page 30. I know we've discussed this before this is my fault so do we have an exact if we continue to pay we have a prepayment in this building yeah yes okay so if we extrapolate this out to pay any of it what is the date that will be paid off like December 2025 around the time period or the person we get you're talking about um [Music] we're gonna stop okay we analyzed paying off it didn't make sense so I mean that's great news is 20 . here tomorrow I just brought that up this year basically four more years [Music] of 40 000. 60 years experience Bernie has a mortgage okay thanks I don't know what month yeah so this is a medium maker so it's on her calendar that day right so there's a the full payments go 425 and then there's only a 40 000 and 26 so that December of 26th December 26th foreign was there anything else that was really stuck out [Music] um we also had to make contracts under the control uh they talked about that additional one of the full-time position that was an increase everything else and I really there were some things that came up that increased Sunday because you're spending more but a lot I try to to reduce child so it would be in closer reaction to spending and insurance there's less you know like excess money left over each year Heather you heard a comment sorry Kyle the insurance you didn't talk about that tonight he had um [Music] the insurance um and it's better to go to the detail s a non-departmental that's what it was success because all your Muslims and the highest increase is the property insurance and thoroughly the city's totally plan on a 75 increase in the property insurance um we won't see those numbers until closer like well I guess time period I have another Municipal insurance company that's going to provide numbers to us to compare property um property you'll see 75 because what it was estimated to plan on everything else they told me to put on increasing reliability um when the workers come you know who's 10. okay I I don't see where it's Mark yeah it's a supplemental page yes if was there any claims that we made yeah [Music] we're paying for uh all the damage down so well that's what it wins overall damage I think maybe this general liability property should have gone up that much have we had any claims in the last few years the structure well he they told him 75 for the property and then the other one's ten percent the only claim we ever agree on recently as the um the sign that was several years ago for property insurance but they said it's going up based on everything else that's happened in the state and uh if you've had any luck with the uh the quote from another company I'm waiting on that they had told me so we can prepare for more than another company I think we can get slammed he's the first thing the answer to any claims in the last three to five years if I have maybe some companies aren't even quoting you are so right Farmers nope what's your zip code yeah I don't know what happens whenever you you hit this point where you're uninsurable and you have a yeah what happens what happens when you have a mortgage yeah I think it is and then they really need you yeah ability to find yeah and this is Scott sometimes yeah good luck all right I know this uh meeting is ran very short I actually am sorry that we're not moving into the works of regular work session next but it's scheduled for Wednesday so um does anyone have any other questions for Kyle at this point yeah this is just really tangential small stuff we just appointed two new people to the Pinellas County uh was a floodboard Frank something like that I just want to make sure that they got money the budget for them has increased I guess for travel and whatever they do that's all I mean it's really good news okay I just want to make sure you're okay yeah it's all it's all right appreciate it it's a hard one I'll say for the most part this was one of the easier budgets to read laid out properly I guess I didn't have a lot of questions whenever I was reviewing it of course it helped having Kyle a couple hours with me but everything looked for the most part and uh really there's not a whole lot to ask about it garbage collection problem resolved and I also hope that our we can come up with a better course in what we're getting right now on the insurance last chance uh former councilman Clinton if you have any questions yesterday and we put together a question and we all can understand excellent job Kyle yep okay yeah it's all there is and I can hold this until break time how about slideshow family stories are you looking for emotions to ask any questions or talk about the budgeting initially again a great job Kyle and Heather appreciate it um I have emotional great motion to insertion all right second yep all in favor aye foreign"
