    "transcript": "thank you hello everyone and welcome to the emergency city council meeting with Monday August 28th 2023 at 10 30 a.m uh this meeting will now come to order please would you please call the road council member Frank Banker council member Leslie Notaro here council member Mike zable mayor Dave Gattis city manager Kyle riesler here and City attorney Randy Mora president and council member Livingstone and Roberts and vice mayor Shirley are not in attendance yet and for the record we do have more all right uh before I ask for approval of the agenda I think it would be fitting to flip items two and three current state so would you would like to make a motion to win the agenda so I have a second all in favor aye opposed all right the agenda is committed now we need to approve the agenda do I have a motion Leslie material secretary Frank Baker all in favor aye any opposed all right the amended agenda is approved so we'll go right to item number two which is Emergency Management update by city manager refluence thank you mayor so as you probably heard over the weekend the National Hurricane Center has been reporting that tropical compression number 10 has turned into the tropical storm idolia and it is still on path for the Florida West Coast including Pinellas County area the last situation report from the county right now is still projecting heavy rains starting later tonight the prediction is six to eight inches so we can be erased as soon as tonight into tomorrow um six to eight inches is a significant amount especially at Dollar Beach um so we need to be aware with the tides that we're going to experience this week we're looking at 3.6 relatively around noon um so with that alone with our with our check valves that we have throughout the city that they won't be able to empty midday we forget a large amounts of rain we're going to expect fresh water flooding in the streets um on top of that we're expecting tropical Force store tropical force winds as early as 7 pm on Tuesday night um then a hurricane force winds as late as for as early as excuse me as early as uh Tuesday night and that could be up to a cat three at this point is projected the surge warning right now is the timing is looking to be Wednesday morning which is beneficial uh based on the way the tides are coming into the in this area it won't be during one of those Peak High Tides but they are predicting as in the last report storm surge of four to seven feet which is significant um regardless of what the tide is at that will affect residents of the other Beach um there's slight risk as always with hurricanes for water spots tornadoes the EOC for the county will be in full activation starting tomorrow morning level one it may be sooner depending if they have an executive policy group meeting at noon today I expect that there'll be decisions made shortly after um as of right now we started posting information on the website and sending out a constant contact for the residence about our sandbag station activation started at 7 30 a.m this morning planning to go to at least 6 p.m we have two 20-yard loads scheduled to be delivered should be coming late this morning uh right now they're calling me when delivery for when the truck leaves uh one will go to start another pile of sand and replenish the sand game over at Bayside Park and depending on when that second loan is timed and where our lines are at considering going to a load in the marina right now we have three uh operational staff our public work staff working in the sandbag um station I will have to break off one if we do decide to go to an alternate location of the city marina and thank you for buying and the you know the demand goes up high enough it'll be beneficial to have two locations working um depending how fast that sand goes I plan on ordering more sand but there will be a point because the storm is moving fast and we're looking at Tropical force winds by 7 pm tomorrow the city staff will eat you been in the sand station just leave it open for residents to get sand leave the bags start locking down and securing you know City buildings parks so just that's something where I have to play by here um if we if our level any evacuation starts um the storm begins to move as quickly as it is then we're going to have to start you know fuel um getting fuel and the equipment and moving the equipment and securing them the building and uh starting today when we started last week but I have Debbie klatka and you will be going around to the construction sites to get the most secure we have limited hurricane reentry passes right now I spoke to Deputy Valley with Pinellas County Sheriff's Department he is bringing more passes early this afternoon currently the city could use volunteers at sandbag stations and um possibly with the re-entry passes we tend to have people come in that have had them and they're registered they just don't know where the pass is so right now with the limited amount we're doing one per household Deputy felony is supposed to at least give me 200 more but depending I'm probably going to stick to just the one per household right now so we don't run out I imagine it's going to be the same situation if not everybody has a pass there's going to be alternate means it doesn't get back on the iron like they did for you so just uh just to keep in mind as a recap it's still coming it's coming fast uh we're good we're already going to be at high tide levels we're definitely going to get rain we should expect fresh water flooding and then right after watching it and determine after it gets passed the store gets past Cuba we'll have a good idea of what it's doing but we have to plan for the worst and for the best at this point can you give us an update on what the county has done so far so so far the county just had a commissioner Board of accounting commissioner's meeting at 10 A.M they've declared a state of local emergency and they like I said they're going to have another policy meeting at 12 or at noon they're supposed to give us updates and there's daylight hours to do a level a evacuation gives about 72 so I think they're gonna have to make a call soon on that so there will be an update we have a city managers meeting with the County Administrator at 1pm and then there is a Rock which a Rock Hall which is only emergency Personnel in the area at 3 pm Council question the re-entry passes don't expire do they yeah okay any other questions for Mr Reaper no all right thank you for that update uh I would like to add all of that there are certain areas in our community that already flood without a storm like this I would advise everyone in those areas employees and make serious preparations uh whether they have a mandatory evacuation or not patient care for the worst and start thinking about the best way to see shelter and Higher Ground also if you have are non-public remote please check also and make sure that they have a way out also that's why I do expect some of these homes in the first three nights area to have more so let's all think about our neighbors and remember that we are Miller Beach so any other questions or comments we'll see no all right so we will now move on to item three which is consideration of resolution 23-05 just for more information would you mind reading the resolution Mr Mayor this is resolution 2023-05 a resolution of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida declaring the state of global emergency in Miller Beach due to Tropical Storm The Dahlia slash hurricane Dalia and potential bit of harm to the city to the residents of property and cities and other nations and a reading of resolution 2023-05 thank you Mr Mora before we move forward let's go to the citizens for conference would like to make an eye can we see anyone remotely just check that real quick I got no hands uh councilmember Roberts texted me but I told that I asked him on mute he hasn't unmuted so if he unmute he'll speak through I guess Mr Roberts can you hear us unmuted Mr Roberts would you like to uh can you hear us all right but we'll just move forward all right I'm going to close this and comments and uh now I'm going to need a lotion to move forward with this resolution pollution made by Frank Baker do I have a second second second by I might say so before we do that we're getting Council would like to make sure all right hey would you please call Mayor do we include council member Roberts or no we can we can put him on record if he's able to vote okay council member Banker council member Notaro council member Roberts shake your hands up and down if you would okay yes thank you thank you council members Abel yes mayor goddess yes ma'am vice mayor Shirley also says yes okay all right please she texted me she's listening so is that a vote yes thank you sir okay thank you all right so the resolution passage unanimously that concludes this meeting with someone like to uh um uh yes and and they have you have the ability to make that Proclamation without the need for a meeting and then ratify and after the fact retroactively which is also done in other communities so if that's something we can we can make sure isn't specifically or if it's on already okay the motion is for you so we would we would have to modify that just procedurally we've already done it and now so we're good for now right um as far as going in the future we get a resolution ordinance in our code and make that clear so we don't in as much as its desire I think it's clear that's desired and I can make that an action item okay but we don't need emotion all right thank you so much"
