sir please come up to the podium and give us your name your address how you doing Randy leavitts 13th Street uh first of all I'd like to say kudos to Mike zabel in all my years of following politics locally he's the most proactive local official I've ever seen between the newsletters emails office hours everything else I mean it's just it's terrific I mean we have access now direct access constantly that we can get in touch with our community leaders okay I think you've given everyone something to Aspire to I really say thank you uh getting to the points I want to bring up few years ago a couple years two three years ago I came here and I complained about the benches on 12th Street access okay we used to have six then they upgraded the benches with these new Resident Ventures where they're nice but we went down to three okay and they put a garbage can right where one of the benches was on the left-hand side and they built a big Sand Dune up on the left-hand side towards the shower so really if you want to go with your wife or somebody and sit on the bench you're going to be looking through a hunk of sand with weeds okay we need we need more benches up there some nice just very crowded and we end up standing you know behind the benches and everything I don't know why you can't get three three more benches up there and I brought it up at that time there's six benches sitting out here I never see anybody on the Pokemon on the side right here so steal three of these and put them up there if it costs for lunch okay um you need a bike rack or something up here uh perhaps in the very very first space on the right hand side little bike rack people come biking up to the easement and they take their pipes and they chain them to the back of the benches with a handlebars sticking over into the bench area so of the three that are there and the two of them you could only see you can't really have the time to sit there because there's bicycles leaning up against it or maybe there should be something to do with a simple white rack that would hold on okay um two three years ago I came to a meeting and there was a big presentation here about adding one of these I guess ad Forum taxes or something and the fire department from Indian Rocks Beach was here in mass and the chief was here and it made this big spiel about you know instead of to help us out with paramedics and whatever over on our side instead of taking 10 or 15 minutes to dispatch somebody from Indian Rocks Beach and bring them up here you know they were going to raise our taxes and they were going to buy this building on the corner down here every time I go by there all I see is Hispanic guys they're loading grass and weeds and stuff in the back of trade which looks like there's a running a long surface out of there I I really want to know did we ever buy that building was that building ever broad as a it was only a substation I think they called it and then the big screen was if you get a heart attack on 13th or 14th they're a minute away instead of coming all the way from Indian Rocks Beach so they raised our taxes and I don't see any any fruits of our investment then what happened with that building did we did we ever buy that building thank you Mr Levitz um we generally do not respond directly to uh citizen comments this will give us time to think about you okay that's fine too later or at the end of the meeting that that's fine okay uh my other I'm sorry sir you're out of time thank you very much that's it okay they're doing it again okay you're doing it again you should be aware of that raising the taxes and we're not going to get anything out of it all right you know we're on to item number three which is the law enforcement report from and Alice in Canada good evening Mr mayor council member staff citizens Deputy Steve clackett for the record uh first off I want to apologize I do not have a report for the Sheriff's Office activity I thought there was going to be a sergeant here in the city but I will double check on that and get it back to you all as far as a code enforcement again another busy model keeping busy with a lot of violations and and the nice thing is that people are now really confined in a short period of time getting things completed one of the other things that Kyle's going to be bringing up we've met with commissioner Roberts my supervisor Sergeant Jason stibbert Laura I saw for a little meeting dealing with the code enforcement issues I think it went very well I think Kyle's going to speak about that later on this evening other than that um everything's going well ahead uh I will tell you that my my messages on my phone have pretty much stopped so evidently we must be doing something out there correctly because we're not getting any too many complaints out there so that's my report and I'll stand for any questions Council yes Vice America how's it going today good how are you I looked at the monthly code enforcement report 6 out of 28 milligrams 21 of them reference Corinthians 22-3 typically in one View event and there's no explanation there I added all your code to look it up and see exactly my case just for the application of the people in our viewers and the council could you just specify what that is and why the focus and what you're seeing that basically yes that deals with mainly Landscaping brush trees if I get a again we have a lot of vacant Lots here that are overgrown so what I will do is I'll get with either Laura or Kyle and find out who the property owner is and then the local leaders will make a notification to them to have those those issues taken care of even though you were done pretty quickly we do have a couple little issues of one is out on I believe it's six three where there's a house that is vacant it's in Probate the homeowner had passed and trying to get a hold of somebody in the family to take care of some vegetation mainly trees growing over onto the properties next door that that um at one location um and it does take a little bit of time because again trying to get a hold of a contact or or actually Taco family member in this particular case I have left two messages with the daughter of the mom who owned that house and she has to return my phone calls so our next step is we're just going to show violation and then cite cycle home over and then go from there other issues that we're seeing is the I'll give you an example if I'm done Auto I have one house up there that has crutch or bushes a taller knee feet trying to get them again most of these people are out of state try to make contact either with the property manager or whoever's handling that property and trying to help you take care of those those issues but all in all it's been pretty successful and some of those those complaints have been ruined over that any other questions yeah um pull back a hurricane we had some power outages how I think it was what fifth or sixth grade dance some or because there is a family entry probably the largest tree in Delaware Beach and basically has surrounded encapsulated uh power lines going through there that thing has to be cut period coming from Maryland you have to do proactive cutting this tree has caused power outages before you it's got to be stopping you got to stop the tree before it does it again right um do you know about this this giant baby tree oh no I do not but I can look into it but I will tell you with Duke Energy there was one house up on 15th we had the same problem where they cleared out a lot uh the people are actually clearing the lot had to stop because I had to get a permit from Duke Energy before they perceive any further because of the the actual trees growing into the lines itself and I will tell you that that's been going on for a month and it's still from what I understand the permit has not been approved by Defender this one's going to be stopped uh you got that plus you got line power lines that are about 10 foot off the ground I mean everybody got photos on Sunday so we kind of got to get a game plan to adjust this before we have the presidency is it in the evening you can read I don't know which one then they'll come out and they'll assess the tree will determine yeah it just went really got to be cut back and then Danny you're talking on these days before it's it's huge huge and I believe the property that's on has Runners on it you know this will perplex me but I'm sure we can do it yeah because there was one that there was a Australian kind that we finally had to take it out and that took a little bit of time you're a legend with that one yeah yeah okay so pretty much uh but yeah we'll look into it sir appreciate it removed yes for what reason uh two reasons number one there was a nuisance because those Australian fines the yields come off uh it was actually on approximately owner's side and uh because of the needles that were following it was going through somebody else's Screen through their pool and she had that taken care of within about two weeks well I mean excuse my French bitching about an Australian or north of the pine for at least four months now on 8-0 I think it's five Hardwood Drive got to be at least at least 80 life being told and it has done damage to a neighbor's uh full screen three neighbors have complained about one of them just moved the mayor's been out on that site it's leaning there was an arborist out on that site it's it's been waiting to happen I don't see any any uh saving or issue with that okay and what was the address on that I believe it's eight o'clock it's a big new line there was a house there they tore the house down probably five years ago council member Community I'll address this this is uh the 805 Harbor so that so with the Australian pine uh we acted out in that immediately because I thought an obnoxious weed list with the state um so further code it was in violation um I did speak with Duke Energy about the claim that they were going to remove that tree that's not accurate apparently a resident call took energy out to assess a tree that was in the evening behind their house and then we made another report to assess that tree but given that it's on private property it's not something that they're going to address so I did clarify that it's it's Duke's not interesting so we kind of heard that there was a letter sent um we still have any hard ordinance a nuisance tree citation or viable code that we could say that without it so the area that we discussed now as I'm getting a proposal to kind of do a hazardous jury Suite in the city fair and assess all those trees as you already know well God thank you for bypassing us on that storm a week ago but uh that storm would have came up here at tree would have been in somebody's house any other comments from the council okay thank you very much yes that's nice I can see we have someone from from the sheriff's department are you prepared to address the Council on a report I decided to pass it anyway and he's coming in okay all right thank you very much I'm sorry we don't we don't address the citizens do not address the the guest speakers thank you thank you all right and well I'm assuming you you receive these reports you're the first one that gets this report yes in the event that the sergeant wasn't here we would be able to address the Council on this report yes okay would you like to get started and then we'll pass the forge so this is the report that covers the month of August for law enforcement contract just going to summarize what we had reported here um as you can see and one of the bloggers we have one more Vehicles put out I don't have any background now okay Sergeant would you like to come up and address the council where we'd like to hear your report do you need a copy of it what they're looking at you want my coffee oh sorry for being late indie usually this movie is on the first one the other one we also have an assignment with Bel Air flops on their City to be there at six o'clock for a city plate for me we'll give you a pass thank you very much sir for the August report for Bellaire Beach there was one motor vehicle theft on the first page there's no other UCR Prime stats for that page the second page here at 9rs or total of 12 charges on individuals in Butler Beach during the month of August on the third page there's 940 events requiring 1070 uh Deputy units responding to those events the final pager is one crash during the month of August in your city and a combination of 214 citations of an organization thank you I'm curious about the auto theft because if this person will leave their keys in their car I won't have to look that up and get back to you and I do not know about this meeting until the shortcut okay on those Council questions thank you very much thank you sir all right next we have a presentation from the Florida latest cities council members Jody Shirley and my table please join me again before all right on behalf of the Florida legacies I am pleased to award in the certificate for completion of The Institute of the Lincoln Municipal officials too and that happened in Fort Myers on September of the 16th and 17th 2022. up first member Judy Shirley the Mexican council member Mike said foreign all right we are on to item number five uh that is the quarterly board Rewards we have a report from the board of adjustments please come up and state your name and uh that's here good evening Mr Mayor Mike Kelly I'm the chairman of the board of adjustment and I got three quick things to talk about this past quarter and we had a resignation from the board in May and debate and you folks replaced that person so we are now a full Board of seven and replace them with David Gardella a month of July month of August we had a hearing a member of the board who accused himself that was the applicant on Donato Drive had to bring up we had to come before us for variance regarding on on what we all consider a bad ordinance a bad code aborted the actual issue regarding the hype that was swimming pool above the crown of the road Jonah Hill and I and several of the people talk about this not long enough when we did show division a couple years ago and we want to bring it back to council but it was work session first it's an issue that could bring other people into requirement for the variants on forthcoming rules the third issue is coming up Thursday we have a hearing we're going to be helping out the interim city manager with an issue where a person has appealed one of his decisions so we have administrative hearing coming up not for a very exibility for an appeal so that's it recording adjustment this quarter thank you very much Mr Kelly Council any questions any comments Vice all right just for the audience could you just quickly review what the appeal is for you know the person wants to tear down an existing home on 22nd Street and put up a three-story home which is not permitted in our city it's even written in the actual ordinance that you can't even ask for a variance for that and the interim city manager has made made a decision and presumably Kyle if the man is asking where do I go from here and we are going to hear his case on Thursday night the issue is that the structure has is proposing three habitable floors where we're allowed to about a garage or adjacent to a garage but not three he wants 55 foot tall homeless three storage cabinet floors I'm curious new homes two stories to limit new homes you build a garage you're allowed to build habitable a story on the ground we were still allowed to do that it's written above the garage yeah you have to be above the BFD or you you know said you can have a garage and you have to have all the floors above it um you can also have a travel floor to Jason if you're above the PHD Mayors as this board member is going to be at the hearing on Thursday and to create that process like requests that we're not getting any more depth discussing that particular code thank you very much one question um what was the outcome of that the variance was granted um this particular code was written in revised in 2014 at the time of that revision there was a lot of controversy about it I remember physically being here with our city engineer and with the mayor at that time who stipulated but he only wanted it 18 inches above Crown the road which we all thought was wrong should have been higher and the way it's written any new pool especially in these new homes are being built these pools are going to be built way higher the 18 inches above the crown of the road and every single case will have to be reviewed at the city level fund management city manager and we think that campus should look at it we should all discuss it again because when you and I are on that code we're at least skipped over we talked about it but we didn't have enough discussion at that time thank you you know comment your questions thank you very much all right next up is the citizen advisory committee good evening mayor roster David we owe it once this month we've been on September 21st to discuss uh potential need for a lot of credit for the Emergency Management purposes of the committee agree to follow up and do some homework regarding that so Federal city manager uh before and I have been talking with uh the last banks that we did support issues with as well as the last Fallout Council so Gathering costs fees and options so that's where we are in the world we could be the committee we have further discussion great councilman thank you very much Mr Speaker all right do we have a report from the parks and rec board so

Bellar Beach logo items for sale in this event in time for Christmas and then last but not least the health and wellness fair is January 14th from 10 a.m to 2 P.M the third thing that we worked on this last quarter I kind of call it our areas of need checklist was put together by our board member surveys of our Parks and Rec parks and Beach accesses this continues to be reviewed and updated and thank you to the city staff for all their help and getting this done the fourth item that we will review is the easement survey questions procedure and example you guys all have rough draft number one in front of you in your packet so I know you tasked the parking record at a work session to try to get feelers out in the city and Kyle and I met on this and we were thinking the best way to do it to get a well-rounded survey is to hang door surveys at everyone's house now we were not interrupting them we're not knocking on doors we're not mailing something and then if they truly want their room to be known they will definitely answer the survey so they can drop it off at City Hall during business hours or they can drop it in the mail slot in the back Black Box by the entryway near the parking lot so what I would like to do is just briefly I don't know if you guys get a chance to read this yet but I want to make sure that all of the council agrees if these questions are clear and succinct and that you think we're going to get a well-rounded survey because we don't want to pass out the survey and then have it you know these weren't good questions or I'd rather have your sample approval before we do it and then you guys are all happy and it's just the results are what they are so it's just four questions number one are you aware of the 10-foot grass easement that runs from 2nd Street to 18th Street in Beller Beach you will be shocked at how many people do not know that it exists would you be interested in the city Paving the easement at a cost of 200 to 250 000 oh these are all yes no um number three if no would you like to see the easement improved by some other means um for example shell geocell ground Grizz Etc yes or no number four would you like to see the easement left as is yes or no and then there's a comment section and like just if you're talking to people about this in general people bring up things all the time that like I never thought of so I thought it would be a good idea if they could just put a one or two liner especially if they feel very strongly about it but they don't certainly want to come to a council meeting it's a way for them to do something other than yes no and then just their address so you know and then if we wanted to get an address not so much a name but an address so we make sure that we don't have deeper kits so they just have to put 97 Harbor Drive and then um and then at the oh and then it has instructions at the bottom please submit your survey for December 31st at the Bellar Beach Community Center after hours submit through the March outgoing mail slot on the back pedestal mailbox at the back at the back entrance of the building thank you um Beller beach park and rec board in the city of Bellaire Beach and then at the bottom of that I did a little perforated line because of course we've got to get our our info in which is some save the days that they can cut off the bottom I figure if we're walking door to door for every single residence I would like for like to get a little info about our events so anyway I would love your input and if you don't want to do it right now maybe you can email Kyle or text me or email me but what do you guys think so far councilman is there any way we could do electronic ballot through our website we only hit about 300 people so we can um but we talked about that we don't hit nearly enough people well we have that signed now um we're going to sign you know about the agency because I I agree with you a lot of people don't even know he's just right we talked about putting it on the sign we took to talked about putting on the city website we just don't get enough people I mean we could do it at the beach cleanup we could assign you know randomly we could stop stand out on the bridge but then there's no way to ensure that we don't have duplicates there's no way to ensure that we get a good play you know if you go in specific sections of the city you can get all yeses or all knows and that's what I wanted to avoid I wanted it to be like a good representation of the entire city if we could get it and believe me I would love to do this electronically we don't particularly want to go door to door and hang these I mean it's not something that we typically do but you guys task us with this and we want to do a good job and we want to get all the information that we can council members Abel uh yeah I really like what you've done here and uh tell you what behind this I got a list of I said that an email to over 611 people back every two weeks you know through the hurricane et cetera but I'll send out your service to them have you considered uh possibly taking a survey or polling at your event we can but you know typically we have um 20 people if we have like 50 to 100 if the kids you know what I mean it'll just be the parents at the Halloween event we were not sure of the numbers of the chili cook-off we're hoping it's very well attended but we just don't know we can but then we have to make sure that we don't do duplicates if we do the hangers on the door so if you guys don't like the hangers on the door if Mike zagel's email list can hit 611 residents it's more it's a bigger number than I've heard in the past with the constant contact like the three whatever it was with the last update I had but that's about what it was a path the residence for three 300 or something three years no my yeah mine is at least yeah yours no no I counted mine today 611. and there are no duplicates like the husband the wife on separate emails or anything like that that's something you really can't tell because of everybody's behind at hotmail.com you know good luck but I would say the majority of those are you know it's up to you guys I mean door-to-door we're gonna have to enlist as many volunteers as we can because the park and rec board it will take a month for us to hit every single house walking up and down we're going to kind of do it like the smokes do with the flags and try to get that many and sign everybody two or three streets and then it'll go in like 20 minutes I don't think that there's a single council member here who hasn't hog something on the floor you'll find plenty of Volunteers in this group okay are you guys good with the questions do you think it's a fair and like we're really getting I didn't want Lincoln's questions no it's a very good respect and you got the note section and you got the address to eliminate the dude so like Floyd Roberts the only thing I was thinking about as one of those people that really didn't know there was an easement there would there be any value anything in letting the people know on the door hanger as to what some of our citizens use that easement for you know it may help them to think well why would we want to pay two hundred thousand dollars to improve it not better with be in favor of that but just something and you guys are probably way more aware of and I'm sure it's used for jogging bicycling football games whatever people are using that he's been for if we could maybe list that and say well here's some of the things the easement is currently being used for on our citizens if anything well this is just my opinion and we've kind of talked about it a little bit but I think that's kind of leaning because like on the flip side that I could also list well leaving it as it is now it's the only place where I can walk my dog where they won't put in their paws when it's 110 degrees out and it's on the concrete or so we don't have sidewalks but you're not walking them on so if I listed all the the good things for having it I would have to list all the good things for not having it does that make sense it does at least in my head like so I I felt like if I we the first list of questions that I wrote some of them I felt were kind of bleeding like um so whoever's writing the survey their opinion should not be known in the survey and I feel like if we put all of the things that it would be good for them being leading no we're on here does it say it's a walking movement and clearly it's a walking easy been called that for the city for years oh I can end up yeah back to your point because it just sounds like we just have an easement of some sort that randomly runs through the city right yeah I'll put that in the title like walking the easement survey that's another another suggestion might be obviously there's blank space on the back it might be a map of where it's at yeah everyone needs to be aware that they're not aware of these where's it at yeah that's a good idea we can do that so you want to you can focus on maybe he's an important that you're going to say about it and show the entirety that people are oblivious a lot of people don't know it's there you know if they don't live near it or even I know people that live on like the streets or they have I think yeah if you're updated you have my email and uh phone number just call me share over and then I can set up when you're ready well do you think that we should do both so people have the option to either email it back in through you or drop it off at the city because then they will definitely the people that you have 600 will get it twice because we don't know like a direct and things like no absolutely another kill you to work there but please you know vote regardless and then to vote you can drop it by yeah I think that's great yeah yeah it's hard because if um as they were during the day I mean they can drop it off in the mail slot but honestly I had no clue where that mailbox was and I've been here yeah we're going to work for the hurricane truck and I sent out those emails so it should work very well for this purpose okay is there a comments from the council um that number 200 250 000. is that a pretty conservative number um because that's like twelve thousand dollars a block and you know that's just the last number I heard and I could put more I could put a bigger number I just put I mean I could put whatever number you guys want me to put in there it's more on a conservative side I just wanted to make sure that we were doing an accurate number to cover the cost yeah I'm just saying the oil's up to another ten dollars a barrel in a week uh blacktop as well yeah anyone else thank you very much so we're good to proceed with this okay perfect thank you okay I just have two more things okay number five um as the Bel Air Beach Community Foundation board has been working on the non-profit launch we have been discussing and giving our input to the interim city manager Kyle reflert on the group program discussed later in the agenda we spent quite a bit of time on that in the last two months of meetings and I would just like to say a quick thank you to Kyle riefler from both the park and rec Ward and the Bellaire Beach Community Foundation for his time and attention with everything we were trying to accomplish he put a very understandably told us that he didn't have time as he is doing two jobs and managing so many manners that are higher on the priority list he's doing an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate everything he's doing for our city thank you does anybody have any other questions for me just we had a citizen talking about benches needed at it and by the beach access is I'm not sure that really is able to place mentions but would that be something maybe the foundation could look into selling benches and having them placed were needed throughout the city and see if it was if we can place them on the beach access yes um yeah all that's on there so there'll be benches bike racks of when he was speaking I thought you know the official launch of the foundation will be at the November city council meeting so we'll have a table at the Halloween event we're going to have a table at um and we're going to be participating in the the chili cook-off will be sponsoring the dessert table and we're going to be doing a raffle so yes absolutely so that's the thing we could have launched a month ago but we've been working on the website to make sure we get as many programs like that as possible um and then that's some of the things that we've been working on with Kyle to make sure that the city is up to standards on everything that you guys have already approved so but um for share more information on it next okay anything else no I'm good if you guys aren't you thank you very much okay thank you all right and uh this quarter we did not have a report from planning and just wondering all right iron shapes city attorney's report Mr Mora that you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor it's been quite a busy month this last month work with the entry manager on a number of matters and many of which are on the agenda this evening one of the things that you should expect to follow up to our last meeting I do have almost a complete draft of the proposed sign code before circulated to you I want to have an opportunity to speak to the interim manager about its content format make sure it aligns with the general name of the community before I circulated and if there's any particulars that can be taken into account and resolved on the front end especially with the realities of the ground otherwise excuse me this community did an excellent job in preparing and responding to the hurricane preparedness I will tell you you know for the benefit of the residents that both the manager and the mayor were in contact with me immediately Monday morning following the counties uh just um Declaration of an emergency on the Saturday so that we were prepared to mobilize any necessary resolutions resources and otherwise so just a well done on that one otherwise I have nothing to add but I am happy to answer any questions you may also um yes Mr Laura have you been able to take a look at that email disclaimer suggestion I brought up to be put on all of our city emails uh yes I have I I will tell you that I'm trying to balance as each of you are are committed public servants and I'm also mindful of a lot of the direction you gave me as I started this position on doing work for the collective as opposed to individuals I did receive your request I did I did forward draft options to enter manager refler he and I as we discussed it he suggested depending on the Bevy of things that were being put on the agenda tonight that maybe that would be something that would be addressed tonight but I do have options I can prepare to speak to that if that is the will of the body to that same end the last meeting and I would address it in my report but I want to make sure since it has been added as an agenda item I have had some contacts with the senior advisor program and can substantively when we get to thank you other questions from the council thank you very much Mr Moore thank you item seven interim city manager to report Mr reefer thank you mayor and Council started off we got the 2017 Street project that was scheduled to start on September 26th the hurricane Ian put us back a week and actually started October 3rd since breaking ground I didn't down to some of the actual utilities we've discovered some some utility complex and um so we uh we were working around a couple laterals we discovered a foreign but so there's a workaround offset line item in the uh in the contract which we can utilize to get around that one one thing that was not in the contract is um we can't work around campus at the sewer line uh Forest like this directly behind that um in this case we're going to have to get the procedures working on a proposal from the contractor to have a change order for the conflict box so I hope to have that put together this week and to address not sure if we're going to schedule my remote session index in one day a special meeting to address that [Music] um another thing that we ran into is we discovered on the North side 12th Street between the easternmost Inland there is a pipe that did not the surveyors didn't pick up so we discovered 112 feet of 15-inch RCP when it was discovered I got the camera crew in there to analyze the plug because I knew it was something we're going to add to our line out of 15-ish RCP that we want to know the condition of it we did go in there having the camera footage and Report which I'll send the audience view but it was very much so um probably even worse than the rest of the RCP but just so you can see what your own eyes did send it to the engineering firm they recommended that it gets replaced in that case it's going to be 112 foot overrun which we do have a line item for which is a 120 dollars per linear foot so that that cost of looking at about 13 13 and a half thousand additional for teenage RCP which that will come out of our 10 built-in contingencies which is at 65 000. so just to kind of keep in mind what's overkillment on that project I will have all these numbers to present you um change order should hopefully be next Monday as far as the young adult full of our underground project currently utility consultants in Florida or out there through Court preliminary conversations with the residents like about the boulevard for probably now go all of our Duke Energy is required in easements for the Transformers for the undergrading to take place so it's a 10 by 10 foot easement again utility Consultants are providing residents preliminary information that you have legal contracts at this point but we are giving them information and providing pictures to give them an idea of what they're expecting to come um the 7th Street and 16th Street Seawall and 7th Street boat ramp renovation project that that's moving along nicely now that we have started and we received at a permanently coming here with Vietnam so they are driving viral sheet piling in at 70 anchors at both sites and uh and having to be a meeting with contractor and the engineer assignment um they are actually going to work with us at the end pull out the checkout that we've recently replaced it's on the street where they extend that pipe out they're going to fit it in it actually build an extension over that valve itself sort of a nice Titan bit that they're going to do the same at the 16th Street Seawall which we did not have about in that place so we'll after this project we will have valve in place and we'll be doing it for us but let me go nicely as far as the 17th and 18th Street stormwater project still in the design phase I did receive a proposal from Dual Associates recently we've had resident inquiry into the stormwater timeline it inspired me to kind of update it and show everybody where we're at that's why I sent that out to you just to give you an idea of a little bit of history of the projects that have taken place and where the budgets were adjusted and where we're at now I've contacted a bosomatic with an assistance advisory committee about that timeline and unless you discussed further because as part of what they were charged and they was looking into options into flooding projects and possibly lines of public things along for the city wanted to kind of get his opinion possible options for moving along in our Capital project system Electronics we plan on meeting this to be and uh just as a start if you look at that timeline work we're funded uh not only for 17th and 18th Street but also for the next Friday which is going to be 19 20th and 9th Street so the funding is actually in there in budget and um I'm feeling I already started talking with dual Associates at suddenly under engineering performance because I think it's like a better pricing uh already talking about the intervention proposal for the first project and the proposal for two project systems um our code enforcement analysis project we've been on September 6th I went very well I think we were in there for probably three and a half hours during the project and we got a lot of insight from Steve's uh protocol to Steve pluckus Sergeant Sergeant sticker uh the first time I met him but he was actually he was a lot and so he's going to want a background in community policing he was very helpful to have a meeting so from that meeting we talked a lot about the ins and outs of Code Enforcement a lot of challenges that are faced to different communities and we thought our next step was going to be to feel out of our residents and sense that we've got to put together a a survey that we're planning on setting up this week via the constant contact UM got a couple more tweaks I'd like to make to it proposal technology but send that out with a deadline for the end of the month to get some some solid feedback on what's important to the residents and hopefully maybe identify the different geological geographical areas of the city and and see maybe what's important in one area is differs from another and then from there we're going to reconvene in the talk strategy and how we're going to reach what being the proposal or meeting the expectations of the president the City Hall Seymour Seawall project I now that we have the funding in the budget I sent via the thirty thousand dollars into the capital projects code I want to go out back out and get a preliminary estimate from I think I'm going to try to Enterprise my radio to the sea wall there on the Bell aisle to just kind of feel around if we're in the correct fall part before going out to it just to make sure you know if it's going to come back higher um kind of reassess it look where we're going to be able to go out there maybe we'll let the numbers here will be um children's playground is still on back order some other projects that we have coming up with this new budget here we have the new admin assistant I am in the process of taking all the admin assistant job descriptions and coming up with our current description of what we're going to use and advertise um another project that is fully funded as of October one is the community center generator I was going to check back with that contractor and make sure the numbers are still online but I also like to bring this um as an overall Emergency Management item and a work session to consider some of the needs we have as a city for Emergency Management agency if it's money best spent and on this backup generator or if there's something that's more beneficial to our resident Center needs for an emergency and if you could possibly use that money for it first of all Kyle to menu on the excellent job he did preparing the city for this storm people saying you're doing two jobs this man actually was doing three jobs the last two days he was physically filming sandbags loading them in people's cars we were so blessed with the staff that we have including this woman right there and the women that work in that office um I really believe all you deserve a bonus for giving up in our Sundays last year he gave up uh July 4th of the weekend our field staff doesn't live here so a lot of Chris called and said that said you know I got my own house to prepare but they didn't paint me came here and they did an excellent job I was here I guess those 6 30 uh Monday night didn't look good and everybody got sandbags we had plenty of sand left um I think when we left I think we still had like 15 bags to build ready to go but um did I hear you correctly that there's a 112 feet of reinforced concrete pipe on that project over there that didn't come up on the original survey and correct and that that job just got I think what I think we uh voted for three to pass that I commend you Mr Mayor because you pushed it ahead and I'm never into patchy uh construction sites um 80 year old place needed to be replaced is there any chance on that set of three dial when you go in there can you raise that about 60 inches to a foot or would that just throw off the holes uh float you know the criteria flow on that because that valve is too low right now and there's still water comes into the street it does close but I understand that I believe that would be a completely at this point changes code for the variety if I could not I can ask an engineer if anything you know I don't know about the Integrity of the other bike that would be you know it would be it would be beneficial to be a degree too and there was an email sent out on October 4th by a resident about a sign on the beach Victoria Miss uh the more properties uh if you got it yeah they said it was on the public beach portion no trespassing time I I'm I'm a little bit leery of any signs on the beaches um there's two down at 28th or First Street in Bel Air Shores get a good winch tomorrow who knows where they're going do they have to be permitted by the county that is the state's territory space territories okay so when I when I first was aware of that assigned in contact with the fdep they told me it was a lot of further standards it was allowed with a single pulse design thank you question again two two things the first one is we talked about the emergency generator so take 30 seconds here and set the stage for what the alternatives are interested some of the things I've been looking at is um are standing for seniors but this last storm really tested us um we had to put out a little more sandbags in a short shorter amount of time than we ever had since I've been here I've never heard of it two of our standards index we went through about 5 000 bags in a matter of two weeks and um it seemed like we you know we were backed up we tried to regulate the traffic it would definitely be something to improve on finding better needs and I did some research on them they do make a stand bag of manufacturing tools and they also make attachments to uh that would fit on our tractor to make 20 sandbags at a time um I think this is something that we should look into the prices on them or anywhere the attachment being about ten thousand dollars um and then some some really nice uh cinematic tools uh processing where you scoop a bucket and put the salmon in the top and it pretty much produces sandbags that that runs a little bit higher up 20 25 000. but just options to consider what works best for us another uh idea it would just be if we get a way to more easily make sand that to to build some kind of shed storage facility somewhere on property where we can palletize Santa Max and have them available for residents who wouldn't need and I think so many of our production levels and our ability to hand out send or access to handouts denim banks will be demand is high he might solve a lot of a lot of the problems that we're facing just this last event my second thing is you've got some big projects in playing here if you're doing a great job you're running at 120 on a lot of these things so my question is you're wearing two hats right now so you know my observation is anything you can touch you do it in 120 you don't back off on anything if anything your maximum Focus my concern is you're trying to cover two jobs right now your plane is running over give me some idea of what your concerns are that you're not capable of giving to your full attention one of those things that could fall off the player that you're concerned um thank you for asking by tonight primary concern would be my um my attention and supervision that I can give to Republic works now that's recently been taking on the additional responsibilities I feel like they uh I I I do try to communicate with them and as much as I possibly can but I would like to be more involved at some of the things that they're doing and also um the training I feel like a I could be doing more training with them just after I had the time to be developing up with my um it's just concerned that it's not it's it's not sustainable over a long period of time I was just we're getting by um and they're doing a great job to really picking up the slide in every way possible and I commend them for that they typically don't it's a lot of other way to to ask something let's say to have something important that they need to know another concern of mine is just the overall uh project management we're trying to move things along we're trying to do projects going but find any time to get out in the field and um just monitor what's going on whether price is a concern and uh what I hope it's been apparent to the council but whatever tried to do is not just keep the city afloat and hold on I'm trying to keep us moving forward or trying to accomplish uh yeah I before I go to further um I want to thank you for everything you've done but I want to point out uh councilman Baker I want to thank you I mean we're both out there multiple days shoveling a whole heck of a lot of sand um but that brings up something I guess I showed you the list of these things is what it could be recommended here in the short-term feature is taking that sandbaged filling station out of that area because it was just a one-way Street pilot and that's not fair to the citizens we have a perfectly good Marina that we can use increased at 83 stations you could Snape the traffic in there and it doesn't hurt the citizens more importantly if you haven't looked around lately we're not a really young Community we don't have a bunch of weightlifters out there um I know about Captain Banker myself we had we were delivered to other people but we don't have a list of senior citizens and they can determine firm that can't do their own sandbags and what I'd like to do is the local code later is we get together kind of a quarter of some citizens that can actually get a list of people that need the sandbag Services we come out first time get a take them deliver them and then install them for the people but uh don't give you some points a little later like today you've already seen some of the basis of it so some thoughts from the same day situation going forward I guess um Kyle so you mentioned the 15-inch I guess it was elliptical concrete mine yes that they came across where approximately was that located okay so the um we're at the corner of 12th and Bay you have uh in Seattle this CDs unit on the south corner and then if you go to the last driller I didn't like yeah and that's where all the piping is on the planet but if you take that Inlet and you go across the street to the north side there's a magic Inlet that would cross pipe underneath from that Inlet to the last on the north side of 12th Street for the first two inlets there is 112 be connecting 15 inch RCP okay it kind of completes a big circle right they did not know that I was there yeah actually I think I did have a conversation with the engineer on that particular drawing and pointed out that it did not make a lot perspective times and it didn't show up mine and he goes he finally agreed yes there should have been something shown there but more importantly said you said that you felt like when they video that time it was not in good condition was it the pipe itself or was it more of the joints again it was the pipe itself this time there was a lot of cracking and leaking and vertical cracking okay um but I will provide that to you okay that'd be great but I took a look at it I'm not an engineer but I I thought it was a little worse than the other yeah yeah I did actually stop there I think Sunday evenings and I saw some of the five-day Advent taking pictures and um it was late in the afternoon I'd lost a few football games had some beverages like it's in pretty good shape that particular stuff that was filed there but probably most importantly typically an engineering firm will have errors and emissions insurance so we need to definitely look into that because it should have been their responsibility to identify that and have that in the plans and that's what that insurance is for so the contract is going to come back now and say change order city of villa Beach you owe us money which we're going to have to come up with but if it falls underneath the category of errors and omissions from the design engineering firm that's what they have at insurance for so we need to make sure we ask them about that and their insurance could cover our additional costs to where we don't have to pay that that's a good point you know really I'm surprised if we don't have accurate maps of our airless structure it's it's a little shocking to me actually because we're old but we're not that old so I I guess as we move forward maybe we should have those drawings updated and have more engineering at least something Americans because it really sounds to me like we completely drop the balls somewhere in our history on that one particular pie the next thing I would like to come commend everyone who participated in Magnus and however I will say that this is 2022 and there are alternatives to regular old stockings I don't know the cost yet but I want to share a product maybe that that I came across and those were my sad facts in fact where you just take the black flat bag out of a box that's tall soak in water and it becomes a water or barrier for the water and you can store literally a thousands of those on a very small place again I don't know what the cost is but when you look at the amount of Labor and the critical nature and so the fact that as Mr Banker described there are people out there that are unable to help themselves so this would be a faster way to get those sandbags out without having to actually go out and date Sam so I'll share that with you and we'll see if it's something that it may be a solution for Hillary School board great great job a great rapport any other comments yes well I've been here eight years I'm not sure how long you've been here but eight years ago we used to have a lot of men or former city manager said it was I guess landscape contractors come in stealing some of the sand so that's why you lock it up but maybe from like May 15 to October 13th we could have one day a week now I'm sure no one will probably use it you know because everyone rushes until you know wait until the hurricane comes where they where they can save them maybe one day a week they could come over just fill up Sam if they wanted you know I was over there one night this year a few months and says you know something that we don't know and I'm just getting prepared you know but um the other thing this really works used dad and um like you probably know it the quick stuff you put the drum barrier around it when Hurricane Sandy came up they ran out of sandbags in New Jersey but once they had dad and the dad comes all easy and pushed up never does but no it completely sealed uh supplements they had no drug damage yeah I agree with that quick stuff I'm still scraping up I can't get rid of it any other questions or comments for the interim State manager all right let's move on to number eight the city clerks report Mr Gentry do you have report Ed um mine was just the hurricane we were surprised at how much we had to pack and move and get up high and then cover for it it came in from up top and and then we were here the very next day and unpacking and putting everything back in place everything has we move so that that was good and then the next thing is the board of adjustment hearing that chairman Kelly talked about so we'll be having that and then last time we talked about the leads that have been file and so those three that are listed have been paid and the only one that we haven't heard back on yet is uh the 16th Street one so we should get that back any day now great Council before okay just thank you Patty for staying late there's nights and I'd like to thank you for uh for getting these uh these minutes I think that's a lot of work anyone else thank you very much all right we are up to the consent agenda discovering items 9 through 14. this is for approval the July 19 2022 special city council city manager search meeting minutes approval of July 28 2022 special city council city manager search for meeting minutes approval of August 1st of 2022 special city council manager search meeting minutes approval of September 7th 2022 city council meeting minutes approval of September 19th 2022 city council work session minutes and for authorization to execute the intervocable agreement between Pinellas County and the City of Bellar Beach providing four joint control of pollutants within Pinellas County that being said do I have a motion for approval of the consent agenda motion second to make a motion Judy Shirley and the second was thank Bakers all in favor aye any opposed all right the consent agenda Passage foreign consideration of ordinance 22-04 first reading Mr Moore would you please read the summary happy Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 22-04 an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending the city's code of ordinances to repeal Provisions establishing the Gulf of Mexico safety zone in order to conform to applicable state laws and regulations establishing a vessel exclusion Zone designated as a public bathing Beach restricted to manually propelled vessels only providing for the installation of regulatory markers establishing violations relating to the public bathing Beach establishing the means of enforcement providing for the incorporation of recitals providing administrative direction to implement this ordinance providing for severability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading ordinance number 22-04 by title only I spoke with uh Andrew I'd take lead on just presenting the Staffing on this hopefully this ordinance should not come as a surprise to muyu this is the product of a series of attempts at other and other drafts that did not best serve this community's needs and desires that is the legislative process and totally fine we also had a workshop on this on this issue and specifically with this draft in mind to discuss it where this body considered alternative options what this does is it conforms the city's code to the modern state of the law on vessel exclusion zones and the city is given the leeway under Florida law and Florida administrative code to establish vessel exclusion zones one of the categories that the city can establish is a public bathing Beach and we have elected to establish a public bathing Beach as a community the term public banking reach is not specifically defined in Florida statute of the Florida Administrative Code though many other forms of vessel exclusion zones are that leaves that that leaves that matter in our honorable powers to Define as appropriate and in Conformity with the other Administrative Code provisions and that's what we've done here so the proposed the Gulf of Mexico safety zone as you know it or to some the existing area within the buoys as we've known those movies in this community would now be a public beta Beach where you are allowed to operate manually powered vessels so if you have a sale if the sale is down and hopefully impossible rotors up you and you're manually operating it you can come in paddle boards kayaks canoes all manually powered all permissible within this Zone this does not allow for um excuse me this does not allowed for combustible engines to come in even if briefly as that or under a low weight that is not a term a approach that we could count on this while in keeping in harmony with the existing definitions in the code statute so this truck this is an organ ordinance attempting to reconcile the Equitable interest of this community as articulated by the commission or the council rather that balancing the interests of your recreating public with your Beach going public and and public bathers and children and all the things that have been raised in the various hearings ultimately this is importance which makes it a policy decision all policies voting policies are founded by some legal requirements But ultimately this is your your decision to make as a system thank you Mr Moore before we have discussions on this I'm going to need a motion to approve I'd like to make a motion to approve second Mike single and Frank Baker uh Mike Sable if you had before uh We've obviously discussed it thoroughly and then also you're not allowed to use a sale a sale board a kite sale in one of those high-speed applications um just it comes down to really one thing look not everyone's going to be very happy about it but this protects everyone thank you other comments Frank Baker I believe this ordinance action applies with uh section 30-144 section three motorized grants not allowed to be in the beach areas of the Bel Air Beach and has been on the boat for 20 some years and I always held this one back because anyone knows me uh I've been complaining about buoys from Bel Air Shores up at Bellar Beach but um I I was in comical at some time to find out that you know people wanted to Anchor their votes and they've been anchored their votes which was completely prohibited for 20 years so hey I'm glad to see the movies you're staying thank you Mr Baker yes Floyd Roberts I did have one question Mr Moore under definitions so number three is going to get a visual in my own mind where it talks about Tesla's equipped with sales for mechanical means of propulsion and you enter the marked area of only of the sales of mechanical mean to propulsions on use mechanical name what are we trying to convey there I just want to make sure we're clearing that mechanical meaning what because later on it talks about here it says and if possible to do so the mechanical means the propulsion is tilted or raised out of the water so we would be giving those the ordinary meeting the ordinary meaning the chemical typically applies in an artificial mechanism powering and not not simply a pedal connected to a Spoke that's not mechanical means as this is constructed in context okay um what you'd be talking about is the engine or a the sailed down the engine up you know in some especially in little Skiffs and things that you get in the shower or water you can tilt that up so it doesn't scrape the bottom or things of the like and so that's what it is referring to the mechanical needs to be the combustible engine the um that sort of uh construct okay so I just want to compare that's that's what I thought so assembly did have a combustible engine but they were outside our boobies and they said okay I'm going to shut it off you're going to paddle into Shore that's permissible I mean under this because the mechanical means are no longer I've engaged you're in use then there are functionally from from a velocity standpoint which are one of the concerns right um that we were trying to harmonize from a velocity standpoint at that point they are though they are maybe larger than Mass all right you can't paddle a 28 foot yard nor can you get to the shorter um at that depth but your your velocity is indistinguishable from paddle board okay I just want to mention yeah thank you other questions comments Mr Moore I'd like to thank you first off for taking the time to tolerate us throughout this painful topic it's uh it's uh you definitely have more patience than most of those well I want to I want to take the time to commend this body I want I I think it's important to recognize that frustrating though it may have been this is how the legislative process is supposed to work and I think ultimately over the course of our three and four drafts we got to a better word product and and that's the goal the goal is ultimately to balance the interest and get a better work product so often and forgive me but I'm going to take the opportunity the opportunity to use the soapbox so often that division that we're seeing that we saw in this process is characterized as um you know stalemate and this person's in intransigent we can't get anywhere nobody's getting anything done this is the process it's very frustrating inherently our Democratic process is frustrating and it is slow and it is inefficient um perhaps lower than the middle but it is the process it's designed with that in mind and I want to thank you for your patience with me as we work through that product as I got to that understanding I do I do know um as between the workshop and now and on this first drop there may be one slight difference in the second reading harmonizing some of the elements that remember Notaro raised before on the prohibited activities being specifically called out and insured that those are harmonized with this draft and we don't believe anything lingering or at least stating anything that is in conflict is is superseded I meant to address that between publication to you and I did not that will be addressed and has noticed to the public that will be addressed more light most likely in your second draft unless we decide that we just want to do that bicep thank you and I'd also let the community councilman material for calling into your attention um let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to maybe not on this topic okay all right back to the council and we will give Mike today the final word yeah it's uh definitely agreement here it's taking a long process but I also want to join this more rides also been a very good chance for us to work together and learn our working Styles he said as when you first start a job it's difficult you don't know how people will work how they will react and it's really proven that this new city council really does work quite well together including you know the interim city manager and the City attorney so closing I recommend uh you know oh yes go forward with this thank you very much all right so now we're going to take a vote and this is to approve the first breeding of ordinance 2204 Ms Gentry would you please call the law council member Baker yes council member Notaro yes yes council member Roberts aye council member Shirley I'm council members Naval I am vice mayor Dunn aye mayor Davis Hi so it passes unanimously and we will do this again all right we are on to number 16. consideration of resolution 2022-07 Mr Moore would you please read the summary Mr Mayor resolution 22 2022-07 a resolution of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida ratifying the state of local emergency in Bellaire Beach declared by the mayor due to tropical depression nine tropical storm Ian hurricane Ian and its potential threat to form to the residents and property of the city of Beller Beach and providing for an effective date and termination date this has been a a first reading of resolution 2022-07 person only reading there thank you do I have a motion to approve resolution 2022-07 ocean Boot made by Joey Shirley and I believe Frank Baker all right and for sure you have the employer so this is just receivable or something that you said yeah time to clean up the resolution from Hurricane any more after that hey any other comments from the council all right let's go to the citizens on this any comments yes John Hanson John Hansen 22nd Street first of once again please Mr Mayor will the city council members put the microphones in front of their faces when they speak there are two of them I could hardly hear thank you on the resolution I don't believe I have heard anything from the state that Governor DeSantis has terminated State local emergency so my question would be um do you do U.S mayor have discretion determinated prior to his declaration or does that work I would normally we don't respond to questions but I will own this one if you would like Mr Moore to address this yes yes and the question is well placed and I can you know I I first want to begin by stating um this this resolution in no way suggests that the events to the south of this County are somehow fake news are unreal and nor are you suggesting that my folks are in Cape Coral and I'm very much aware of what that looks like this is uh Falls within our whole world powers to recognize that it would likely be insincere to suggest we're making emergency purchases at this time because we don't have the means time or resources to go through the ordinary channels and so through our home rule Powers we can recognize we don't have that need any longer though that need May otherwise exist in the state and so for purposes of this declaration it's recognizing that for we are return to business as usual and we are not going to invoke emergency powers and good faith we are prepared to turn thank you sir thank you Mr hanser any other questions or comments from the citizens okay all right let's bring it back to the council with council member Shirley Haddon the last word all right so let's take a vote I think we can just do this on a voice quote this is to approve resolution 2022-07 all in favor any opposed yeah um could we do a roll call on this please we sure do thank you all right in that case uh please stay for them council member Baker yes councilmember lotero yes council member Roberts I'm council member Shirley aye Captain America hi Samir gun aye mayor gatherings aye and surprisingly we come up with a second answer all right resolution 2022-07 passes okay all right on to item number 17. this is for consideration of resolution 2022-08 Mr Mora you're uh thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2022-08 a resolution of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach delegating to the city manager the administrative authority to authorize the use of the city seal under certain conditions making related findings providing for separability and providing for an effective date this is a first and single reading of resolution 2022-08 by title 11. do I have a motion to approve resolution 2022-08 Leslie tutorial for a second second to be surely Leslie you have before other comments from the council um I just wanted to make it clear why you are wanting to have this authorization so uh I had a conversation with an attorney Laura of a situation where where we need to approve the use of the seal obviously in a positive life for the city and I asked them what they uh procedure would be to do so and then he presented another it was actually a county resolution as an example though it's done and I thought that you know given the guidelines it was it was something good about my place kind of help with the procedural things that may be in the way through the process of using this ACL I understand and was there something that came up where there's no medium name for that uh in consideration for the Community Foundation programs okay I just wanted everyone to hear it any other comments from the council he said CEO of registered trademark foreign office has done trademark and and intellectual property registration of city um intellectual property I'm coming into this I haven't been asked that question yet we can certainly look into whether it is and if we desire to do that I will tell you that in some communities first and foremost putting aside uh Federal copyright law it is a it is a crime of the State of Florida to use the city seal without authorization which is the the Genesis of this resolution to ensure there is no misunderstanding and to make very clear the conditions under which the the manager would assume that the way this dialogue actually started um approached me with the idea of extending this to the city sealer logo and as we had that discussion we realized there is no logo to the extent some for no nothing beyond the city seal there's the term is sort of used interchangeably and we don't want to dilute its protection by characterizing it as a logo but in communities like and just as an example the city of Dunedin where they have the official seal and then they have that sort of primary colors labeled Dunedin that they use as a local those are registered and if we want to go to Alternative designs that may have an expanded use where we say we're good with the local being used but not the seal and sort of tier or brand those uses that is an option for us and we can look into that at this stage I'm not I haven't seen as manager reflu is not aware whether this is registered but I do think it's worthwhile to make all that known to answer that question I was just wondering if it's not registered is the resolution really valid yes it is it is valid it is this is this is legally customary and again within our powers to to do that both based on your mark statue I understand all that way would a federal judge appointed and you know it's it's a license so yeah a federal judge ultimately it's our intellectual property whether it's registered or not it's still you write it if I draw a picture here that's not Mickey Mouse that is some random creation it actually is entitled to copyright protections right there it's just an unregistered copyright we may have diluted protections this has a city seal and an official legal document what we would be granting is a revocable license so the legal framework for that exists thank you for explaining that voice America I was going to say this whole thing Resurrection some painful memories of the city of Miller of each one years ago people tried to use this symbol behind us for not for are you shared a meeting or anything like that we just would say hey are these things are going on in the city of Venice Beach so you know it was debated local seal whatever the thing that came out is that is not the symbol that appears on our city seal that we stamp a Doctrine in the city still that's not the statement that's why so I'm saying I guess we need to really hear our arms around this thing because you know we just kind of reinvent this thing every 45 years or maybe it's time according to your code of ordinances this is in fact your official City seal um your and the resolution of Flagstaff um that citation if it is not your city seal that is you know I'm ongoing based on the legal documents I have access to um if there's in that many whether or not that logo is used on what the clerk uses as a stamp may be something else and that can be looked into whether those can be harmonized but according to your code of ordinances in that specific depiction appears and is officially designated as the city seal well that's that that warnings was a result of this whole painful development I'm not quite sure it was given us all of the theory yes no I appreciate it just basically kind of went down the road and that's what began to help you to basically drive all over the position of the City attorney understood I agree well maybe we're doing it over here Christian Johnson actually educating me now with with better the table this and get it right because I didn't know there was two we just you just educate me this is a resolution and not an ordinance so we're not changing and aborted we're we're authorizing you are authorizing the authorization here is specific in its scope um you can just I'm not I'm not suggesting to you what you should do ultimately that's your decision as a body you have the ability to table a resolution in the same manner you have an ordinance because it's still a policy document of the body if you are not comfortable with this content you have that ability again I I was aware that that ordinance was passed and I believe it's 2018 and so that would comport with what you're describing them a few years ago this was a topic of discussion um and so if there is if there are miscoming misgivings misunderstandings or we feel due diligence needs to be done we can address that if this this specifically as written the resolution specifically identifies this document as it sealed and or this image as the sealed and the image that a revocable license could be granted for if that's not the image that this body recognizes as a seal that would be information to me that would be relevant like smear gun then I will put this issue to one time was getting done I removed motion my motion that would table this until we can provide any for the easy way for the signature instructor we have a motion to table on the consideration of resolution 2022-08 padding I think we're going to need to do a roll call boom on the table pretty good council member Baker yes table councilman otera no council member Roberts no council member Shirley yes council members Abel no vice mayor Dunn all right mayor Gardens no so the motion of table fails we need to move forward on voting for this resolution however we have not yet taken any comments from the citizens would anyone like to speak on this topic nope all right back to the council and a bit of pledge can I say something I would say that with this moving forward we need to have a plan putting that position because it has been an issue that's worth it's had a few times and it was ugly to the point that Council was wanting to prosecute one of our citizens for innocently placing this on piece of communication that they generated so it's a it's can lead to Serious ramifications and I do understand that my reasoning for moving forward this is because we still have the the community right so we need to need to give them something to work with and in the meantime we should start working towards correcting this problem there we go so we're back to uh taking a vote on this we're going to have to take a roll call councilman Baker no councilmember Notaro yes councilman Roberts yes councilman Shirley no council members Abel yes vice mayor Gunn aye mayor goddess all right so the resolution passes five to twos and we will revisit this in the near future all right we are on to item number 18. this is to nominate and elect the advice mayor following the resignation of Glenn Gunn for the vice americanizations before we get started do I have a motion to nominate and elect a new vice mayor motion made by vice mayor do I have a second second all right Terry Shirley has a second so far the council members who have expressed interest are Leslie Notaro Jody Shirley and Mike Sable since the motion was made by vice mayor Gunn I'll give you the opportunity to make the first nomination this Council membership is comprised of people bringing many attributes to the accountancy among those things or long-term residents and you've seen the good side of Miller Beach they've seen the bad side the evolution of Bel-Air Beach for people with the tremendous business Acumen you have a lot of expertise and codes in contract and they bring a lot of different aspects to the business side of running the city people bring assertiveness to this job they they've stepped forward they take a leadership role in this thing to get things done people bringing corporate history to this job what things are we reinvented here what have we tried before the day in word what we tried before that works and rather than waste time revealing the wheel that's continue to move forward out of state most importantly voting on and doing what's best for the residents in the city of Dillard Beach there's only one person that comes to my mind that has all of these attributes term residents they've seen the evolution of another Beach good in good and bad tremendous business in our community contract includes assertiveness taking a leadership role and most importantly the corporate history so we just talked about some of these things with the use of the city to move overseeing or wherever we're going to call it but most of all this person always always votes their mind of what's best for the residents what's the best for the city of Miller Beach personal and James's side first help healing Society what is best for the residents and city of Dillard Beach and that person Jody Shirley and that's the person I nominate because that person because of all those attributes in one person should be sitting front and center on this desk alongside the mirror in helping shape where this community goes so my endorsement and nomination is for German Shepherd thank you thank you Mr Gunn uh I will I'll take other nominations it's kind of hard to follow that I don't know how many of my soul all right Mike's Abel any other nominations here major project s daily and amazing and so on thank you very much any other nominations right I know that we just heard from political that I would like to actually hear from each candidate is like speaking and address the Council of the citizens what it's here now Joey Sherwood well I've been a resident of Bellaire Beach since 2000 I have a lot of history here I'm actually not some concern I have a lot of history here I've seen um many councils come and go I understand why we have a place and one of the things we have in place I am I consistently move forward on new ideas and new projects and stay stay consistent with keeping our infrastructure top on the list and not getting cotton Weeds on a lot of the small items that um that will affect citizens but in the end if we don't have infrastructure and a good running management team none of those other items matter um I would love to work out the rest of the term as a as the vice mayor but whatever we will decide is best I'm fine with and will support our team where I use it thank you for Shirley now let's go to my example of this economy yeah first and foremost I've attended every meeting here actually early and uh in person I feel that's critical you really have to be here to work and most notably by you know leading from the front within the community I mean just on the last few days you know out there sandbagging uh having somebody out there personally but you know amongst all is I've reached out the community like I said I got over twice the number of people on my email list that I reach up to regularly and I don't think anybody have an award actually any other council member has reached out to that many with hurricane Preps uh would keep them in part of what's going on with the city I think you'll look further there's actually 35 items I'm proposing to get them that will save the city uh you know considerable money and uh no other candidate has done that thing I'll get frankly he's like look if you're a previous Council on every previous mayor if you failed to do it at that time why should we be elect you this time that's all I got thank you thank you very much Mr Sable Ms Montero turn your microphone on okay um been a full-time resident here since 2002 um moved down the beach originally got involved on the beach regourishment when we first moved here I caught a small hammerhead shark standing on my Seawall which is not a good thing but worked with the state and with the county to get that done it worked with very many of the people here in the town and Bellar Beach is a unique Community um it's hard and hard to describe to people that you know we're residential we don't have any bars here or anything like that but I think it's important that we maintain that Ambiance that sense of community that we have here and I would like to continue doing that in the position of nice man thank you would any other council members like to make in a comment oh all right let's go to the citizens of any of the citizens like to comment on these three candidates that's what Tom has it John music on 22nd Street first off let me say I'm not biased because we both served in the Navy however the fact that since councilman zabel has come on to this commission his Council and even prior to the hurricane he has lived from you've got some excellent ideas I've read his emails that's the man that should be the vice mayor and I just have to say again even though I did it in private bravosu will be happening that's the man that should be vice mayor thank you any other comments from the citizens yes sir hi Kelly I've worked with Jody Leslie for 20 years each one of them done an outstanding job I don't doubt that Mike will do a terrific job now in the future um I think this is your decision Council we're not voting who you are you've got great counties and each one of you has to vote your heart so whoever you think you should support you should I'll never forget the phone call from a stranger named Joey Shirley who called me one days when I was mayor and said I don't know you and you must be doing a hell of a job as a guy in the newspaper really hates you if there's anything I can do let me know and she and her children walk the street for me at re-election time so I endorsed Jody I love you Leslie but it's your oh Council thank you thank you any other citizen comments yes sir again my name is Randy leavitts um longevity in office to me doesn't mean much I mean you could look at the current president Who's involved in politics for 40 years and doesn't impress me but I just want to say it keeps going back to the proactiveness that Mike Sable takes each and every day I see emails or notices or updates on the storm and everything else and in the last 14 years or whatever that I've lived here I've never got any reaction from any people that never sat on this body like this and this guy just he seems energized he seems like he wants to do so much for the community so I would encourage you to give him the knock thank you thank you anyone else right so we're back to the council I'd like to hear from each of you that would like to be able to find Frank Baker for coming Miss motero nothing else Mr Roberts my example nothing else vice mayor Gunn all right let's take it to a vote uh you have a ballot each of you have a ballot already there are two they're two uh two blanks one of them is name and the other one is signature brought in your choice for candidate under name and then under signature just sign it yes council member Baker voted for council member Notaro council member Notaro voters or council member Notaro councilman Roberts voted for council member Shirley councilman Shirley voted for council member Shirley council member Samuel voted for council member stable vice mayor Dunn voted for council member Shirley and mayor datas voted for council member Shirley thank you so we have uh Terry Shirley Cole Mike say for one when I was playing Ontario two congratulations Jerry Shirley you are now the lifestyle [Music] um foreign now we are on to item number 19. consideration of appointment with Park and Recreation board alternative member to regular members this was supposed to be their the cosmo however Patty informed me that Mr Cosimo has decided to remain as an alternate member therefore I'm requesting that we withhold any motions on this island thank you all right now we are up to number 20. this is for consideration of an agreement between the Baylor Beach Community Foundation and the City of Miller beach boarding great great program this was added to the agenda by interim city manager Reedley before we begin discussion do I have a motion to approve absolutely that would be Leslie patero and you will have a second that was Judy Shirley right um I'm going to peer this over to Mr Reaper and let him explain what we're trying to do here thank you mayor so um just to start out this is the first agenda item number I I started listing the Strategic plan um as I brought up in the last meeting and I feel this one falls under the aspectives in the community security I need you to speak up a little bit sorry I'm getting some feedback on this Mike okay there's a little better um so uh what I was trying to say is that as far as lying this uh this item up with the Strategic plan under this represents goal Aesthetics and Community um and uh what this is is it's an agreement works on my attorney Laura for the the dollar Community Foundation the great great program this agreement some key points of it like so let me just give a little history of the Builder Beach Community Foundation that was it's a newly foreign public charity [Music] um their mission their mission is the BBC has commissions to foster a healthy beautiful and thriving environment through good works Community Improvement projects and social Gatherings to enhance the lives of the residents some background of we brought this up in our Parks everybody Recreation Advisory Board they like the idea just to kind of run a biome we came up with two possible locations for this took it to later and I included as attachments so the agreement itself is um it uh it places the BBC up in uh in charge of selling or receiving funds for referring tax maintaining records of funds and maintenance of the bricks so the BBC Optical manage every aspect of the grade prayer program with the exception of the initial installation of the brakes now responsibility one other point is that the city is agreeing to install the brakes they had a minimum of six breaks and not the bbcf will not request the city to install all the breaks more than one time per six months I also included the ABC after Gradebook program order form um as well as the suggested locations at the park and recreational have came up with the key element to these locations are visibility and feeling the signal property was one of the most visible properties in the city thank you very much councilman maybe for Mr Mora a foundation she's also chairman of the parks and rec board does that cause any issues I think the question that you were asking is a dual off holding I can't tell if it's Dual office holding or if it's an Ethics question in as much as the in the as I understand BCF is an entity entirely separate and distinct from the city so you don't have a dual office holding element because it's not a public office in as much as your question is a member of the parks and rec board is a member of the a member of the Foundation this non-profit organization I'd have to know more about what their salary is and how that's remunerated but in As I understood to the extent this question had been raised in the broadest terms possible this is an independent non-profit entity looking to partner with the city this that parks and record director doesn't have the ability to independently direct the city's funds and resources that's done by the council so that's not that's not really a power I don't see an issue as it's presented based on the facts I know thank you other questions or comments uh Frank Baker um under the rich child's establishing a great work program to recognize and honor persons organizations defense related to the city of Bellar Beach and it's just something more like the Indian Rocks Museum where what way you go in there because you know you work with people's names to the events they have it botanical gardens has the same grip wall there's a lot or is it just going to be like you have to have you have to do something for the same or recognize the cities and pass bangers or something like that or who they who's going to pay for these breaks is what I'm saying and who's going there to say this is a lot of non-line so the uh people who fill out the application they're paying for the brakes right and it's a form of raising money from the foundation to in turn positively affect the city um and then the determination is the dollarbridge Community Foundation they will um I believe we put in here it's something of a positive tomorrow's newest he would have to screw it okay it's not just a few minutes we'll perform a due diligence background investigation versus organizations so yeah it's a they're they're solely in charge of of um approving the Rex taxi crackers it has to be something that's approved for funded by the city and they would have the approval not the city itself or the foundation I'll give you an example I want to buy it where God plus power exactly improved or the way to the farm are we not allowed to use the word god although excessive evidence for me and that the only exception is that you've been convicted of a felony and you want to put your name on it I'm just trying to get some clarity because I I reports down in IRB they weren't I believe it's the same Foundation that authorizes it is not the same Foundation as much as developer Community Foundation is not partnered with that City to my knowledge it may be a similar model I'm not familiar with how that program specifically operates I would tell you guys relates to the agreement that is before you the way it's drafted is the initial there is a section called vertex exclusions which remember Shirley called out but the way it's written bbcf has initial um editor's license if you will if somebody says I don't think bbcf has made the right decision here or I shouldn't be allowed notwithstanding bbcfs position that does provide a dispute mechanism where they could appeal the decision um to bbcf and bbcf representatives would meet with the city to review the original request and render a final decision on the appeal which will be forwarded to the donor so there is an element where if somebody says I want this and bbcs says no I'm sorry I say fell at Beller Beach Community Foundation and they say no that person has an opportunity to say hey I want the city to weigh in on this as part of the process that's how it's designed so we don't have to pay for the appeal or anything like that the city right that sounds like it would be much more of an administrative hearing that the manager perhaps sitting with a designated representative of BBC upsa explain it to me let's go through there's nothing in here that contemplates a quasi-judicial hearing before a city body it's not a city program the city's just making its resources available to enhance the beautification of Aesthetics but it's reserving a right to participate in the process so that and that and that is a sort of a contemplated check and balance if they are being arbitrary courageous and aren't actually discriminating oh well it says this and we just don't like that they're going to have in that person says I still want this the city is going to have an opportunity to say no you can't do that all right thank you other questions or comments from the council Roberts no Kyle so do you need a decision or do we even get involved in which of the two placement options or is that something you guys are just going to handle I wanted to get an idea from you know what what you thought was a better location okay perfect that's why I included those if you want that AI uh yeah okay if you guys feel one way or the other as you are stupid you know and ultimately what what manager Rico is looking for is authorization enter into the agreement sure so as we look at this having listened to the dialogue if we need to make changes in that appeal language may be one that we revisit to make a little more specific how that's resolved um we can do that so they'd be seeking authorization to move forward with the agreement in substantially the same form and perhaps that that design choice that you just raised so if it is if we do approve this I think it's a good good program of choice um of those two options and I did a 10 I think one or both of those particularly we can talk about different things my personal preference is the actual sidewalk we did talk about you know if we wanted to go ahead you could actually remove one of the rectangular portions of the sidewalks there and potentially fill them in with on scribe grips and then as people buy them you know we can take that out and place it in there we would always have that one rectangular section number of grips in our possession and we could move forward like that I think when people when you walk over it you know people you actually see it better than on the perimeter of the cyborg that's just my personal opinion other questions or comments really good you know let's uh go to the citizen for a quick concerning the polar Beach Community Foundation and the agreement to place Sports all right when we're back to the council and this material you have the final word so um this is to approve the agreement between the Bellar Beach Community Foundation and the City of Bellaire beach for a great great program I was originally just going to do a Voice vote Patty are you satisfied with that yes okay all in favor all right any opposed all right the agreement passes Mr reefer you are all for us to receive thank you now we are all to agenda item number 21. for authorization to approve uh proposed a proposal for plan review Services placed on the agenda by interim city manager Regional this is a request authorizations to contract with Madrid cpwg services to the new building plans for compliance with city codes before we get started do I have a motion so very surely do I have a second second Floyd Roberts all right vice mayor Shirley yeah this is necessary that we have a reliable engineering firm to review these plans in a timely fashion if you go to any municipality they give you a time frame of which your plans will be reviewed and as we stand right now we can't do that so tile needs some support from a reliable firm and I think you can realize that he doesn't want you to do that more thank you um who else other comments vice mayor Ben the council member thank you yeah I had a discussion with the Kyle earlier about this this is the corporate memory thing we dealt with this organization here in the industry project at BBI and we had some issues so just want to read some reassurance that we want to accept the responsibility to in a timely current environment I agree with the question back there we can meet this people don't need to do the contractor necessary and Mike Taylor well this is full source I mean there's any other firms being considered evaluated a little bit of History this came from the irq in 2019 um after receiving eight submittals for that we decided on the top five that we signed agreements with the agreements were pretty broad here for miscellaneous services and plan review from that point this former city management reason I write those firms we found that Larry through the ESG was the best choice given his history and on his flat rates and there anyone he had to bring to the table um Larry worked all of us for a couple years after that about I think everyone here at unforeseen circumstance so he was no longer able to work with us so at that point we moved to dual Associates who was a firm that's been in this area for some time and they accepted to him the plan review for an hourly rate um and then since then um you know they've been purchased by Stephanie engineering and uh from in my working with them it's been taking a little bit longer do you have plans to turn around for review um the head of this uh approval of this proposal is just to reach out to another firm that was on that RIT we can provide another option that we could use but after having a discussion with the former Meister Gunn I think the best in the best interest of the city it's about time that we've been out for another RFQ and at that point we formalized more detailed agreements expectations as far as timelines for thanks for the plan to get oh absolutely it should win after the RSU rather than going to this because it seems like there's no due diligence going into this person yes very dangerous yes it is 2019 based on whatever information was back there here we are asking it sign off because I trust this company I don't know this company I guess this is uh what do you say a temporary enemy to try and get things moving along quicker into the business yeah but we should do it right the first time other comments what minor comment on the agreement page two creating service 3.1 it would probably enter the recipe of a fully School executed copy briefly I think it's difficult spell check fixture even received foreign so um I guess my concern is I'm trying to find a solution on when we can continue doing engineering firm there's some frustration with the turnaround of the site plan review they're being full of grades to continue doing it but I did have a conversation with them today about opening up another option and they were on board with that day the main engineer that I work with Al um I'm carrier he uh he said that they did something similar church around with the background confirm that will catch up so I I do agree with you that riq is is necessary the situation I am for the for the time period of just trying to move things through a frustrating man and I have not or I have actually heard complaints about the time of this of uh of the process um I do agree that we need to do a form of RFA however I have no problem authorizing this as a temporary solution to help you in this time of Crisis and any other comments from the council yes also in order to the temporary standards event if we put a Time framework 68 million days or 20 minutes yeah polka currents were there you know write one checks here you know timeline no we're going to stop that there must be a timeline exactly I agree we need something interim as a Band-Aid stop getting bigger but so let's just put in timer if I may um I would that that feedback is well taken I think what what might be the better way is prioritizing the RFQ process rather than putting a expiration date on having additional resources this is sort of the to to try to reason my analogy a lot this is sort of buying a second wrench to keep in the toolbox and you can use either one I wouldn't advise that you handicapped Yourself by saying well we're only going to go back to that one wrench that's kind of working for us by date certain if for example we're really working on our RFQ process and we're trying to fine tune those terms and now we've got oh this is coming to an expiration date I think that becomes a better reflection of how you folks prioritize your workflow going forward on this and and holding the manager and administration accountable where are we on getting that RFQ out ultimately again that's your decision but I would suggest rather than limit the number of resources in their availability to you that that would be limited better by your next action rather than this action is a product and timeline or so so you've got to put one together just kind of go through the process it's gonna be advertised you got to review it and that so I mean which is why I'm saying we should you shouldn't say like oh we're going to do this for 90 days and then find the Dr Q process takes you 120 and now you're back to only one resource for those last 30 days yeah so so the RFQ process can give us a timeline right yeah so how long would we need for another key process to run um [Music] for the RFQ process that I'm saying 90 days is very uncomfortable with that you're comfortable with that I could be doing a 60 drafting writing yeah 90 days 90 days my table yes okay but that's uh that's not on this so this is something where we just have to raise your consensus on that we're going to fall into that actually I'd prefer not to afford on this I'll make a motion to table this second okay we have a motion in the table let's take a look at this question no once we do a motion the table I'll discussion stops ready calculus sorry council member Baker that's the table council member gun I take councilmember Notaro known to table councilman Roberts no council member staple yes the table vice mayor Shirley no Merrick Adams no I said an emotional table fails now we need to go back to the original motion we've had our discussion uh anything else before I go to this is almost citizens I'd like to speak all right we are back to the council with vice mayor Shirley having the last word oh yes Vice America Mr gun feeling so I'd like to amend this thing to bring any day time limit on the authorization for this temporary Phil thinking RFQ for full time I'm hearing a motion to amend second a second so now this is for authorization to approve a proposal for plan review services with a time limit of 90 days uh let's see I guess we need to go back to the citizens here just just to clarify what I was saying in the 90-day time period I was I was agreeing to uh the RFQ and receiving results from it and then uh scoring and qualifying those firms um after that a uh agreements would be need to be drafted I would request a little more time to to get the correct agreements in place and uh and get the firm sign up on it we currently have a motion on the table to amend with 90 days but you'd like to retract that patient move forward [Music] I think it's given any Services agreement there's a termination of convenience and either part is been terminated on 30 days notice so I don't think we need to put say it's only good for 90 days you know it's it's covered I think what what Mr Gunn is trying to do is trying to make sure that we actually do what we say we're going to do now that said we can always do we can always do another um I had another agenda item another resolution move forward the next meeting before we can just go ahead and come into with a woman I'll always stick with it and then to put a 120 days temporary cpwg assistance the motion makers amending the is is electing to amend the motion from a motion to amend for 90 days to emotional events or seconds for 120-day limitation I believe it was or I forget who it was I think it was going to remember who seconded a member because of the individual second interview of an old attacks okay so now we are working on authorization to improve a proposal for plan review services with a 120 day limit um we have a a motion and we have a second and uh now we're open for discussions I just want to confirm child you're comfortable with 120 or would like another 180 be six months to be a better time period because what makes you get comfortable with it if I prioritizing I can get it done every morning okay another comments from the council let's go to the citizens activity Council vice mayor Gunn all right this is Stu this is for your uh yes sir it's no longer right there oh yeah again it's a hard habit to break all right uh well that's good all right so uh let's uh take a vote we're we're going to take a vote this is to authorize uh the approval I'm sorry authorization to approve proposal for plan review services with a limit of 120 days Patty council member Baker yes council member Gunn all right Captain under Otero no council member Roberts aye council members able aye vice mayor Shirley I am Eric Adams hi and uh thank you I'd like to thank everyone for uh for asking this um I think it's going to benefit Kyle a great one all right we have our own after getting there we're on to item number 22. the moment that Victor has been waiting for this for consideration to execute service agreement with Victor Reaver help me out Victor murienna Briana of course city council meeting video recordings this was placed on the agenda by in our own city manager briefly pertaining to continue video recording services with current contractor before we have a discussion do I have an emotion motion motion by Frank Banker do I have a second I'm going to give that one to Lloyd Roberts on Mr Baker you hit the floor well the memorandum speaks for itself I think he's done an excellent job and I think we should retain it to other comments from the council no comments let's go to the citizens we would like to speak on this this agenda Island nope all right we're back to the council again with Frank Baker having the last word the last word all right since this is another contract Patty would you please call the roll council member Baker yes council member gun I councilman Otero I'm council member Roberts hi council members Abel hi vice mayor Shirley hi mayor goddess I when it passes unanimously 7-0 congratulations in the picture and Mr Rayford you may receive all right now we are moving on to number 23. this is consideration of council members Abel's proposed communication procedures this was placed on the agenda by council members Abel before I call for a motion I would like to address Mr zabel on this just because there's several items in one single my recommendation is to either withdraw the this agenda item or have the council make no motion on it as it stands now I don't think every item will pass on a single vote however I do believe we can move forward on some of these just by General consensus in the next work session these are only my suggestions that the council prefers to move forward with this now we can receive so do I have a motion to move forward with council member stables for post communication procedures oh all right now the motion dies and uh what I would recommend is that we bring this up that's actually not allowed to die but the antenna Iowa did not move forward I recommend that in our next work session and uh Mr reefer he'll go ahead and add it to the next agenda that we take these bullet points and we discussed we have to name his mirror on that there's actually not just those bullet points it's actually very advised and they're very cash so if you put those in a working session in fact I'd really prefer to go with the enrollment session there's a lot here that the council's never attempted before I have a lot of work to go on that works for me and I appreciate all of your hard work and uh taking the time to put some sort of a directional list for us well yeah the idea is you don't come to you with a problem to come up with a solution to it all right now we are on to the added agenda item number 24 which is uh concerning the city manager search um there's really nothing to vote on this it's going to be a discussion item just to kind of roll this end up on a finished basis this was a problem forth by vice mayor Shirley and I just by way of update at the last meeting I was tasked with reaching out to the FLC and its resources replace the phone tag and lead up to Ian and had a communication breakdown as far as online as far as follow-up through Ian I remember Shirley the student he followed up with me earlier today I spoke with the representative from the senior advisor program that is his current moniker if you've heard Road Rangers or Council advisors in the past the new brand is senior advisor we're talking about the same payment program um I I worked with their local representative is Pam ricacho um in other communities and I had a call with her this afternoon or late morning in speaking with her I explained the current state of the landscape that you've done a recruitment extensive citizen input extensive review had a candidate it fell through she was tangentially aware of it she was also familiar and had worked with Mr Reeves in the past and I explained that interim manager refler has been working in the position for a few months and while individual members might differ on what the best step is to go forward there was a general consensus to say let's take a beat reevaluate where we are see if perhaps the situation is working enough that we should meaningfully entertain it or provide this member a managerie for additional resources to ensure his success or that he has the resources to make that successive option for him if you will in speaking with the senior advisor I floated based on the general discussion that I heard at the last meeting the idea perhaps were sitting down with manager reefler getting acquainted personally sitting with a representative of the council maybe the mayor or I'm sure whoever you folks team appropriate to get the sort of the the legislative perspective on this allegedly the bridge perspective and just based on her experience coming to your next meeting which I believe is November 7th which works well with she's got extensive travel schedule and she's already penciled in if the council so desires to attend the next meeting and based on efforts made in the next few weeks provide you some recommendations going forward whether that be here's what you can do through iccma and trainings and otherwise and and what that calendar of events look like whether it's I do think you may wish to go about a search and this is what that process could look like if it was short of a senior advisor otherwise but giving you a read the the general I will tell you that the consensus in most leadership positions is if an ingrown don't fix it it and ultimately if it ain't broke as a determination for you folks to make I'm not pining on that by saying that but ultimately if manager reefler is working out for you obviously destabilizing leadership is never preferable the one point that she and I did discuss was how the council was wished it to handle the fact that internet manager riesler is holding multiple positions and I'm sorry Kyle I know it's like sort of weird to talk about she was like um but the um the her one her one point of insistence was if that is the direction both for the success of the community and the success of the candidate both parties are going to have to decide you know from from men to refleer's desire if he's going to be made interim manager with a contract recognizing that he leaves behind the comfort of employment versus actual employment in in a charter position and also just back whether or not there are means to backfill his position on an ongoing basis is his past provision position if that is a massive position um just recognizing you're going to have resource needs to make sure all needs are met I'm not telling you anything that hasn't been said about four different ways over the course of this evening uh but that is where things stand so my my inquiry to you um in as much as I was uh delegated or designated as a liaison for that resources would you like me to ask on behalf of the council for her to engage in that sort of process or some permutation I think that we're looking for Direction probably could use some some help so I'm only one person I'd like to hear what other council members have to say beginning of advice from here Shirley HP address to the agenda yes so um I reached out to her attorney more today regarding this issue knowing that we need to make some decisions I can tell you that um I think we asked Kyle how he was doing at one of our work sessions in these settings hanging on and we've got to make some decisions one way or the other get some assistance in getting help he can't continue your work the way he is and we need to come up with the solution and a plan on how we're going to move forward it can't be ignored we can't have a meeting go by without this being top of this discussion and having it outlined and whether whatever that looks like whether it's appointing someone on Council to spearheaded that something needs to happen and move forward thank you other comments from the council yes Frank Baker well a little over a week ago we were facing a pat tourcraft 3 hurricane this man has been our interim city manager now since June I think he's been Flawless uh I don't know what more this Council wants out to me he's doing three jobs sometimes um gave up his weekend and gave up his family the service is sitting he gave up his homily to put your city first what more do we want at it um I think we should go into contract talks right now with this man and he's the best candidate for this city he's dedicated he's a hard worker hey if we want to get him a little bit more education come on put it in the contract that he has to do something like that or whatever fulfill these goals you know but let's let's stop this process I recommended him to the second leader or third week of March it's now what seven months later and we still don't have an internship manager it would have been a joke who would have paid 180 some thousand dollars for that other guy to come here he would never fill one sandbag last week other comments um I totally agree with what Frank just said I think we need to change our search to finding a public works director of course yeah I've had the opportunity to um work with Kyle very closely at a couple of projects and meetings that we've had the most recent was when we went over code enforcement and I can tell you that the time that I've I've been here and got to know Kyle Moore and actually see his expertise and knowledge and how he deals with things I have moved the meter in my own mind with respect to to see the best candidate I currently feel he is and here's my personal feeling you know all the criteria that somebody's going to have is going to be our city manager from zero the score of one to ten I don't think anybody is going to be attend in all the categories I'm confident there's several criteria that Kyle because of his working knowledge of our city in the time that he's been here he's going to be pretty much anybody on those type of categories that we're going to bring in the outside it's just logical that's the way it's going to be there's probably some other things that Kyle may not you know meet the standard of some other people that we might bring in in some other categories but I think any of those categories Kyle like any of us would get better I think back on my career and I was put in high leadership positions and I guarantee you when I got that opportunity I went home that night didn't sleep very well because I knew there were some things I needed to be better at and as my time in those positions I grew in those opportunities just like any of us would do and will do so I'm confident now having the additional time with Kyle and see him work and understand things that he has my support thank you Mr Roberts Mr God I'm on board with everything that's as you said I'll ask a couple of questions here because my observations are cut off the Dirty Jobs and when it comes to motivation and dedication we're not going to find here the differences in what we would have paid some of the other high-powered people we can buy or Outsource expertise and you might fall short on I would like to continue to see Kyle self-develop firm positioning himself or maybe some future higher responsibility or something like that in the interim I think he's he's our guy I just need to make sure that Kyle's comfortable with that because you're going to sign up for it and served the pleasure of the council meet backfield behind you and it may have some repercussions you have my trusted confidence I think you can do it and the question is is you should have been to to answer your question and again when I when I first applied for this position I uh it was it was something that I had a responsibility and a risk that I accepted and um I believe that's the uh the step into taking a position of leadership um you know we work for seven different council members so it's just a lot of work it's a constantly adjusting and improving yourself and it's what I wanted so we have the answers yes I think we've had a great observation during high-end High Temple Ops surge operations where everyone is measured up really well so I'm all for maybe an affirmative position in fact go in and give him the resources he needs to to his job programs thank you Mike said yeah I'd like to make a motion that we direct attorney Mora to draft a contract for Mr Calvary move him from interim to full-time and enter negotiations second okay um you're making a motion to draft a contract to move forward with pile as they say absolutely everything I've seen so far work with them side by side uh he's got me with our support he can succeed we do have backups we have professional people that can enter into this and work with them we cannot move forward on his previous position until we locked him down to this one once we lock him down to this one we signed contracts are coming to mutual terms at that point we opened the search for his replacement but as far as time let's get a little bit on this we have a motion on a table but anyone like to comment and we haven't heard anything from vice mayor Sherwood would you yeah I mean I opened the conversation up you know the the caveat was trying to get that pile of some help I do agreed he's probably would be great in the job I I do feel strongly that a senior advisor coming on board to assist him to give him guidelines to Mentor him would be a huge benefit I don't like to keep having these conversations that we can look forward with Kyle I don't know what that you know absolutely what that would look like but I do know that we need to um moving forward in some Manner and getting this off our place so we're not revisiting it constantly and it's not being pushed under the rug so if it's moving forward with contracts that's fine with that if everyone's in agreement I am open to suggestions that we don't have this conversation again and we and we have a commitment on how we're moving forward thank you I wrestled with this for a while and as time goes on I've become more and more impressed with you Mr realtor I think you've uh you've stepped up to the plate and you've done things that I thought for sure would be way out of your wheelhouse but you'd be pleasantly surprising you um I was hoping we had a little more time but it uh it looks like the will of the household is to move forward with this before we take a vote on this motion I'm going to have to go to the citizens for comments anyone like to come in uh let's start with the parts here and I hunt every day as a new fire team I'm not a resident of billerbeast but I wanted to share my experience with Kyle recently here my preparations with hurricane Ian and Kyle and I were in constant communication with each other and everything that we did with preparations and he actually even reached out to see if he could be at our Emergency Operations Center for the duration of the storm so that he could be here as close as possible to Ballard Greece because he was pretty far away normally we don't have uh Community leaders in the Emergency Operations centers as we run an emergency and throughout and through the after effects but that was Kyle we made it the rainfest for him to do that thankfully um and took a turn and I'm pretty confused I mean ineffective but that was kind of dedication to the city of Miller Beach and we made those arrangements for him and thankfully he didn't have to be there but he did um above everyone and share one my last experience and professional experience we had an inner city manager that did an outstanding job and everybody urged the council to hire that person and they decided to go with somebody who had more experience as a city manager and that person didn't last six months and now the person who they originally recommended is the city manager I just wanted to share my experience of what a professional college has been in representing their city and your students thank you for your time Chief Davidson how did you know to be here tonight well I was actually here last Monday and I said where is everybody and it was on my calendar at the wrong time so um no I want to be at your meetings I was going to be here earlier I came in late and I had I'm glad that it was able to be here and given my my two cents there thank you thank your comments they're greatly appreciative thank you John answered foreign for a very long time from the beginning I've been involved in it I'm citizens advisory committee Kyle was in the top four or five recommendations from the CAC and unbeknownst to the committee you guys got to pick somebody that's fine I'm here to concur with everybody and State council members Abel's motion is long overdue I remember sitting here going through listening to y'all at a work session and again the same council member made some suggestions recommendations [Music] that Kyle was agreeable to when he was finally a member of the conversation he also understood the consequences if he accepted and was hired on as city manager and he backfield with a public works director and I sat here and listened to everybody tonight let's vote let's get it cracked that's your man that's our man thank you any of the comments from the citizens all right we're back to the council with Mike Sable and having oh yes Victor I'm sorry you're always over there hiding behind a camera I've been working with the city for a long time since uh Nancy Gonzalez was at the city manager and then um we had our former city manager and Kyle was working closely with all the projects and and he's done a fantastic job and as a contractor I've seen like no change in communication or everything's been presented very well from Kyle so also it supported him so thank you thank you very much any other comments all right now we're back to the council we might say we'll have in the final word okay uh yeah yeah it's been a long process we've met our due diligence uh Kyle and I were very tight together in fact we're working on Park Mobile right now we could probably stay at the city about 2000 a year which is kind of cool but uh he has my strongest recommendation at this point I want to move ahead vote on this work out a contract hopefully negotiate it to the satisfaction of both parties and move on thank you very much all right let's go to a vote this is very important but so okay to do Egg Roll alcohol limitations council member Baker yes to proceed to a contract council member gun I proceed council member Notaro yes councilman Roberts I'm council members able yes proceed vice mayor Shirley aye AmeriGas all right so it's unanimously do the restrooms here I will provide I will prepare the draft for Mr refluence review I'll say it in public venues and the conditions saying privately while you and I work together on a regular basis as I send you drafts who are free to have your own independent attorney with you for your rights and interests I will represent the city as Council in that process change that we're still you know cool um I just kind of have to make that clear um and and so with that I will proceed obviously I have I'm not starting from scratch I'm also not going to be using all the same terms I'll take into account what this body has talked about uh remember Shirley at your point when you talk about the idea of moving forward with Mr riefler is not in common room with the idea of losing and making resources available to him through that process and I can also look at metrics much in the same way that the previous contract had goals if this Council as we go through that drafting process has goals different from or in addition to or the same as what had been in that I believe it was exhibit B to that contract that you think should be specific to Mr member reefler please let me know we can take those into account sorry manageries and we'll we'll work forward with that but if if after a draft is initially circulated you folks feel we need a workshop or something else particularly that weekend of course I'll make it appropriate thank you Mr Mora and I'm assuming that once an agreement is reached and it will be a commission freezler to hire his replacement correct at that stage you will be your chief administrative officer as he is now but with a very clear mandate that he is to fully occupy that office at that point in a manager form of government he will have all the powers to hire and fire as necessary which would include identifying his successor the only reason I'm speaking in those big terms is he's going to have to decide what personnel needs he has as the manager and how to prioritize building those positions and I'm not going to dictate which position would be first or whatever thank you very much for that Claire occasion all right so now we are on to agenda item 25 unfinished basis and we're actually doing pretty good it's only not any unfinished business can I bring out something that needs to be considered soon um just a couple of questions I explaining that zoning who is our um who's our chair for the painting and zone of course does anyone know JC and so we we just didn't never show up for the quarterly reports so we maybe need to consider making some changes but fast forward we've done in the past with this maybe the time we need to step in and make some changes because we do in 2023 we need to revisit our top rental to plan and we need a team that's really going to be interested in doing so so just being proactive that's uh that's good advice and uh I couldn't hurt today is that perhaps we're talking to the attorney I mean this is not an unknown occurrence for this Council the previous Council had problems when they dismissed the member of the committee can we just double check the entry and make sure that we're crossing no Ortiz and doubting all our eyes on this case I wasn't fully following that conversation I understood it as we need to this needs to be something we talk about in the near term I didn't understand it as opposed to terminate the members membership on the board in this moment if I misunderstood that please let me know if we were to terminate a member I have been like to talk about due process concerns and going through that for certain and ultimately the board does advance its own share and vice chair typically if the board is not satisfied with its share with them I think it'd be best to let them govern in that manner and if we feel that somebody is not fulfilling their obligations we can revisit that that discussion I think is proven to raise the issue and say I'd like this on the radar as we have um we find a way of example uh I told you earlier in the night that I'd be circulating sign code as I have a draft that's something that will go before you're planning and zoning board ultimately most likely I've advised the manager of such so those sorts of things will come forward but I I would say appropriate to raise it as concerned I would not want to and ceremoniously announce and make that decision this evening and I don't think that's worth my recommendation is always to reach out to the person that is I think we're having an mandation but I think before it ever comes to that that level of some sort of like any other unfinished business all right now we are all to counsel comments this month we're going to go in computer generated random random expand now that we have an advice mayor she must go last week so that being said uh council member nataro you have the floor no comments councilmember Roberts congratulations Jody and Kyle I bet you didn't think tonight you came to this meeting that this was going to happen so congratulations to you correct an all right yeah I think just one thing about Emergency Management um our city does not have an emergency management director nor should we're not we're not big enough for that but now as a County as a Emergency Management director and those are the people we as a city should rely on every time when we talk about information and videos that are available 100 guaranteed and I haven't even looked at it I guarantee you their website under Emergency Management we have all of that data and all of that information that we would ever need and that's the way it should be set up those people are full-time Emergency Management people every day of the year they have a large staff that's what they do we need to use them there are tremendous resource I want to make sure that that's where we go we can't take on all of those responsibilities within our city when I'm big enough we don't have the people or the Manpower or woman power to do that so use the resources use Pinellas County Emergency Management and we would be much better off of that guarantee thank you Mr Roberts now we're up to council member gun thing I'd like to remember is that some of these issues that we're having a tough time just fighting what the will of the residents are or whatever I think this time just put some of the stuff up and at the legitimacy to the whole thing with people that single other people just to suggest that it costs money but yes yes thank you and I worked at council member Baker well I recommend Mr reefler back in March of this year and my majority of council decided to go forward with his search and further was the only one that voted for you Kyle went there at the county it's down to seven feet after that city manager contract negotiations washed out which I don't know how much money we've paid you Mr Moore more negotiations and everything like that two more times I recommended by motion that we get into this man the contract will move forward I guess finally tonight the council set the side of the tree and sold the forest before uh work he's done congratulations well deserved I think you've been insulting in the last seven months by this Council and I feel bad for you and your family with congratulations really furthermore the City Escape under God's will the category two or three hurricane I hope we've all gave thanks to him and Mr Baker understanding you were making a rhetorical point I just wanted me to clear the tempting though it may have been all of the negotiations were within the retainer because I had joined the process in progress I did not think it appropriate to make it a special matter thank you uh we couldn't use your services on other things council member sayable yeah congratulations to councilman Shirley on that election um I'm truly humbled by some of the citizens comments about me but we're all working to support the council as a whole and uh toward that and I'd recommend Council we've never had a procedure like this before we're actually citizens Commons and the numbers you have to 611 people out there and they're coming back with race suggestions that have never been burned down what I've done is taken everyone sign that I'm a uh to the Strategic plan and I'm going to place those in front of the council so if you've got time council members please look at those are basically about seven pages over 35 items uh that the citizens have felt strongly about and they deserve to know what we're doing about those status and how we're going to move on in the future but that's all I got thanks thank you Mr Sable now we are along to vice mayor Cheryl well I just want to thank everyone for supporting me um very comfortable by it and I will continue to support the state and citizens and you know Kyle I didn't open this meeting up tonight you know thinking that my change in the agenda would bring you to negotiating but I'm glad we're able to bring you help because you look tired and you look like you know so I'm thankful for everything you've done and um happy that that's how it's turned out thank you I would like to thank all state staff members for their hard work of preparing the Storm of the Century I'd also like to thank council member Mike Sable and Frank Baker and others who assist with the sandbags it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day drama on next door and Facebook but in the end we should realize that we are all neighbors we should treat each other as such our situation could have made a severe term for the worst thankfully we were spared in our beautiful Community lives on I'd like to congratulate interim city manager riebler that you're able to complete agreement as well I would also like to thank council member Gunn for his time as vice mayor and I would also love to congratulate vice mayor Shirley for stepping up and and assuming that position as always I'd like to thank everyone for coming tonight and to those who are attending at home with that being said do I have emotions secondary Bible Leslie matero all in favor aye aye any opposed good night everyone"
