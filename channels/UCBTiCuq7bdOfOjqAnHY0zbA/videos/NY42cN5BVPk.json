    "transcript": "things good evening everyone it's now 6 P.M Monday August 21st between 23 and the belly Beach city council work session will now come to work the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty justice for all thank you very much council member Frank Banker president council member Belinda Livingstone president council member Leslie notera here council member Lloyd Roberts here vice mayor Jody Shirley dear mayor Dave Gaddis city manager Kyle wiesler here City attorney Randy Mora president and councilmember Mike zabel was unable to attend number one project plan we have a presentation on Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated uh just uh yes sir okay thank you I'm Larry clay I'm engineer with Kim and I and with me tonight I had Barbara and Justina and their their Engineers they actually are the ones that put the plans together and so between three of us we've got the answers and what the body and of course what comes out tonight will be able to continue and prepare systems thank you well uh starting out I will review the plans and then answer any questions you might have and then we can go into what we think the construction cost um did you bring the magnifying glass okay beautiful thank you well the uh start off at 9th Street and on that project street is proposing to meal and repeat what she does that on um guys all right yeah [Applause] yeah I'm gonna see one get here there we go everybody good so anyway on 9th Street the the project is to mail and repave from the main road around to 9th street the harbor and then up to New York public here by the uh and uh so we're not for those who have rebuilding the entire Road and and the base itself looks good so we're keeping with that replacing the curve and then the project what we're doing is if you look in the this kind of hunting cul-de-sac or the elbow to work being snorkeling up we're proposing because to fit some inlets on there and and also further up to the park so we'll be doing some improvement of what's Happening here there's a reason the waters oh I mean not so hot particularly on high tide and Rain events is this area that I'm circling is a low area so the screen comes down to this point in each Direction so we've got a flow coming on both directions and it it's puzzling there so what what our plan is is try to capture the water before it gets there and allow water to overflow particularly with when the ties up so much you know trying to get a Surface overflow to to an outlet at the uh actually a pond down here where this chart is out two of those as well but I always love it okay I'll go to the next sheet and we could see that we're proposing two new inlets here that's the existing alcohol for the time so these these image right now low with no water is captured on that road so we'll be able to capture it here before it gets out of the 9th Street and the what I'm also saying that during the survey but you know the inland the the inlet that's oven is cul-de-sac here is full of silk sand and so it's not working properly so part of the work would be clearing that and clearing the discharge out so that the water that's accumulated at the end of this end of the cul-de-sac but being able to discharge where it was intended to go and then the water as it travels down the curbing towards night would be intercepted by the inlets there at the pond discharge wall at 9th Street will cook some inlets there and we put in an additional Inland pipe so this could take care of getting uh watered that that can discharge and as it flows if it comes to this point that it has a layout now there are in periods of high tide it may not work as well but it will work so since this is kind of a little ball that we're kind of trying to deal with so that's that's the what we're proposing there and then additionally there's a curved Inlet that doesn't have this kind of closed over on the top we'll put in a great top Inlet there so that surface water can get to it and can get into the pipe system in this turned out I think that would be pretty much the the items that we can take care of barring doing regrading this cul-de-sac here again right but that would be that would be pretty prohibitive we figured this this I think will will help and I think that it intercept the water and the alleviate what's happening down here when when the types up and when it rains I think that you know you're better in the bigger benefit that it is yeah looks like on that top land view that you have up there as well as the bottom one there's some additional information on your your drawing that we have shading that I don't know what that represents you can see it from here but there's clearly so you're still on C1 right yeah okay so it looks like there's some additional information and some drawing differential there has been what we have yeah it looks like driveways or uh beavers are fill down and uh [Music] they uh working with the printers and trying to get this out uh you know when you want something done you know I understand but it's there we will make sure on the uh on the PDS of the plans that we give out and print out okay then all that is is clear okay so I was uh I was listening obviously you're adding several inlets how many total are you adding we're adding one two three four four okay and uh how many are all ninth we got one two two it's four we should have had all this time in the history of the city we've never had Frank yeah um you're talking about raising the grade on the uh I called the spoon um right now on high tide and bad rain that water actually floods from seventh eighth through the easement into 9th Street this upper pitch um so you couldn't really raise that because you're pushing more water back in that 18th century [Music] we're putting as you said two more inlets in yeah what are they going to really do before we've already packed up trying to get the water hits you in a little spot out as quickly please yeah I understand it but if it's high tide to put yeah you put 20 in it yeah is there any thought process of putting like a catch Basin and a pump in there [Music] what I'm saying is these pipes are 75 years old problem I mean uh yeah the system never really worked 75 years ago right and concrete has a life expectancy of 75 years and experts deteriorating and that's our account so we're detachments [Music] what I'm saying is women yeah stormwater pipe is in there especially sea salt it keeps happening it's faster if it's ever it cools everything broken experience but what I'm saying is if we're going to replace the system that really doesn't work I have a book that system I'm not talking about every street maybe we should do a prototype with an ice cream you know right okay well you know that's the thing that's really good kind of bugging me is that this is dating back you know trying to what can we do you know with the water and cause a bit higher than that it slow and adding in another demo I can see It'll be quite good because that's going to lose but still if we still have the same problem and I think looking at public what motivational storage with you but really nothing sticking down is that bottom that cul-de-sac that needs to come up so is there a way we can raise that and afterwards not doing any interference with the existing driveways and still looking in there and that's what I'm saying you raise that you have another problem down the road yeah and we don't want to create it here but would that would that work and if it works how's it going to cost and how do we Implement that and uh I would I would say that would be more advantageous to look at putting in another I agree with you there I don't know about underground tank I have to look closer to that how can we make that work has your firm ever done pumps underground catches yes okay the so that that needs to be taking a look at it okay let me ask you one more question about just this particular Street um to design something that was cost-effective problem right you can't solve it all because we are right next to the ocean we're gonna play did you take into consideration what happens to the other neighborhoods like Frank you could create a problem that you just think somewhere else okay you fix this problem it's not flooding anymore but now somebody else's house is now actually underwater yes okay the that's really our concern was we don't want two cause or push the ball down the road on the problem that we need to take care of the problem and that's the answer I was looking for I do verification sure other questions about uh Ninth Street on 9th Street has there already been a time in the recent history where we where we did replace the pipes now pipes have not been replacing so we're not recommending to change any of the pipes on 9th Street right now right now why is it because they're all in good condition at this point yeah they're in good condition and they uh their capacity is what's needed so they're not under capacity so we already videoed all the pipes on Ninth Street yeah I think if they had it the reason why he's bringing that up is because we did a project on the 12th and 13th Street and found out that we had big problems yeah and uh and it was uh dramatically hired a more expensive than what we anticipated but it didn't solved the problem then we consider it working so we just want to make sure that if they're uh if you're recommending not replacing the pipes that they have been thoroughly inspected nothing to worry about right I wonder if there's questions how old are you now apply a little I mean they're these guys down here I think the construction plans are like late 60s well I was born in the early 60s and I'm falling apart [Laughter] well do you have anything you want to add on this one um yeah but I'll get you there and I think I certainly we'll we'll take a look at what we know the videos of 7th Street make sure that the pipe is okay and that that needs to be replaced and I'm going to make that recommendation yeah we did look at um the possibility of trying to increase the size but what they discovered with the elevations is this piece of plank that runs from the less western side of the Ninth Street down to the cul-de-sac area is very very flat so there's very there's not much room to put anything larger in there right because we were talking about the head pressure on the valve itself and try to make sure that you know and you know and we did determine that one of the most crucial things in this location in this system is that that valve just continues to work because if you look at some of the elevations right down in the cul-de-sac that they're at like two feet and change which is extremely low so it doesn't take very much for the time to come back and Circle in that area with water right another thing I don't think was mentioned was that we are planning to install a check valve at the alpha at the salon because we have noticed over time that the retention upon fills from the smell and backs up into Cedar and uh screws as well so that's over here and that is the swell right right over there system is pretty more glad to hear you're talking about I said I don't need to say it right at the end yes um just some just in general statements so when we did video in previous things somebody came out here they video they gave us their product they gave us was the results of the videoing a lot more comfortable if they gave us a report that basically said this is what we found a written report and here's her recommendation because I still believe the expenditures that we went through on 12th and 13th streets did not need to be as high as they were you're probably more familiar familiar than I am with repairs that can move down to the joints right if you have gasket failures there are companies out there that specialize in that I don't know how many of you guys ladies went out there and said well look I looked at a pipe that was pulled out of the ground it would look great to me most of it I looked a lot of a lot of Belgium well they broke them of course [Music] so I'd like to have the video confirm Supply us again with a written reports saying this is what we found at X distance and at the end of it here's what we recommend with respect to either replacing pipe or repairing the pipe because clearly if we can get by with a significant decrease in expenditures to repair the bikes if there's some you know gasket failures out there there are companies that specialize in that and come around it with the inside and the outside you're probably familiar with those I would hope where they take care of those as long as the pipe is structurally sound and from what I saw the apartment took down on 12 and 13 the structurally sound most of it so you know again all you need is a little bit of a gasket failure at the joint and the sediment starts pouring in there and it's underneath the road you're going to have a big bottle a sandwich area things like that people think Wildlife must have collapsed you know not necessarily it could be a simple gasket barrier that could have been replaced when the inside and the outside the pipe was structurally sound saved the city a lot of money it can last another 50 or 60 years that's a long time I think you know in reviewing the videos uh we got a pipes that are really interesting particles some look I'm good and not a whole lot of cleanings all right the tailors what would be helpful for us uh we're gonna I'm gonna kind of give us a cruise again your presentations yeah what might be helpful is if you have video recordings of any of our street that we discuss it'd be nice to put up someplace where we can actually just take a look because normally you'll see there's you know that they they'll put little diagrams up there oh here's the problem here's a failure here's a crack here's the same messing up and then that way whenever we're voting on this then we know whether we need to activate it the council will have more information and really you don't know what you don't know it's just going on on what you're saying but this Council likes to see things sometimes oh yeah no I don't blame you the you know we have videos but we don't have them on all the screens so yeah look at that I would feel much much better if I could see what it is you know if it's in good shape and we don't have to do it a lot then let's just see what's necessary it's not if it's if it's in there and it's good that's that's great they use a thirsty because and uh besides slip lining that internal bands and graphics and then you can externally if there's access not a lot of vegetation go down and craft all right please continue sir okay thank you well the the other next uh group of three streets will show you is the ones that are behind here so there's a singer and Spruce and uh and those streets these three streets would turn around sheets but those appreciates were milled and replacing the curve okay all right any other questions yeah I know they do have some backflow problems contact me when I first came on board there was a gentleman that called me and again high tide boom goes back this way it goes to the pond and then backs up and I don't even know what street it was I think it was probably Cedar probably seen it um and then the water comes up into that cul-de-sac it just sits there of course into the high tide goes down and then so obviously we don't have um you know a concrete outfall there that we can put a check wrap on there right that's connected to the soil and I was talking about with the checkbook same system um it did improve when we dredged out the retention Pond okay um but having a check valve at the alcohol as well yeah okay [Music] so on high tide to check that I would stop that that's the one over on the 9th Street system any other questions or comments this is pretty straightforward all right all right the next sheet will start on 14th and 14th were built and along with the Curve and leaving the believing that illness and and the pipe there is the existing fight and those are those seem to be okay but we want to verify that okay and so those those pipes and those inlets being [Music] questions or comments or discussions about the center of the cul-de-sac I know that this comes out from time to time and I didn't know if the residents had a problem with the uh the mean and what are you in a little high on in the cul-de-size you know occasionally that does come up yeah we had that on Harrison I remember where we kind of came up with a solution um not on any of these but 14th the 18th that I heard any issue with Liberty I was asked was we've done 15 is um kind of cleaned it on put some more drought tolerant clients in there and some baracks to try to prevent certain trucks and trying to drive is there a general field we want to keep this thing or or have you do we even know I I haven't heard one way or the other but I don't it seems to me that it probably would be a bad idea to ask the residents in that cul-de-sac if they still want it or not because if we're doing this now is the time to change it is that correct yes so um also that wait a little bit more expensive but if you think it'd be way more expensive or would it just be a it's not huge why would you want them well okay every time that we have this conversation there's always someone who gets distracted with their driveway I don't know I don't know what it was like here what happened over on Harrison was the driveway was uphill and big trucks would come in and they can't make it around this feature and so what happens is they get so far and then they back up and make and their bumper hits the driveway now eventually I'll be a case here but it could very well be that there's no issue at all but I think if we're as long as we're doing this and we're going to turn it all up anyway Let's uh let's make sure that they're really happy with it if we don't need it then that just makes it makes it easier in the future it's Joey can I say something yes why would we create an issue that's not an issue right now well if not part of our strategic plan is beautification and Paving over landscape area so I think is part of our strategic plan and if no one's bringing the issue up why would we yeah you're probably right what's in there originate I'm not sure what you need to complaint exactly that's terrible that's terrible no I thought it was another one see I I uh I agree with the beauty but um that's probably not a bad idea to at least write down these neighborhoods that have this and just look at their driveway and see if it's chewed up if it's not just don't worry about it and move on but um I actually had a couple of restaurants that were a slight bickering over one of these features in city manager Lisa remembers that problem again I'm probably just overthinking it but look at it and make sure that there's we don't see evidence or trucks backing up and running on you're driving down that road you know it slows you down this is a good thing you know so you have to slow down and go around their turn if there's nothing there I mean I can see me visit with all sorts of crazy things yeah but you can't I mean I've gone down those streets many many times and because that item is there whatever you want to call it you you slow down you definitely slow down as you're going around that Circle that cul-de-sac and you come out the other hand you know the biggest trucks that we continually have with the garbage trucks I guess they must get around that thing garbage trucks too okay because if they put a little more care it's usually the trucks that aren't there every day that um are the ones driving over it's Construction Construction doesn't happen often construction drugs right I mean all this stuff's built down ensure there's some things that go on or somebody is paying for garage or something I could have a larger vehicle there but for the most part is the garbage trucks and just like you said they they're careful they go around that and there's no issues so I get what you're saying David once in a while it might be construction it's just a matter of riding by there and definitely a deciding whether it's really a problem or something we want to discuss further and I think he was living so for your point of view also may I had one more thing as Jody actually oh is it sure is that I'm so sorry the resident at the time of Harrison that fought to keep the landscape I was fearful of people driving straight into her drive because the road ends into her Broadway so it does although it might solve some potential issue or a truck turned around it does give people direct access into those driveways just something to think about you know that's true in the uh the solution we came up with on your screen was to actually just reduce the size a little bit to give the trucks a little more room to make that turn around that's right anything else on this street all right please continue sir okay kind of King Street just a quick note on 14th Street that the from the north Inlet out to the sea wall is lined with the Cure in place so that that has been repaired it's gonna hold up well for a long time and the nice thing about the camera places you don't see the Barnacles accumulating on the plastic as fast as they go in concrete [Music] and we have videos thank you okay now okay 15th Street on the 15th uh again we're revealing repayment and then from the main road down to the cul-de-sac and here we're supposed to clean waterfalls out of the pipes and leaving the existing pipe in as it is uh and the existing inlets those will be remaining in place as well okay so this is primarily a big military and we talked about each Inlet on on these streets and the ones that are in good condition and there's not any signs of of flow issues so that's the reason how we can feel that it's necessary to change it to a great salary because one of the benefits that we found with the newer Grace we put in was a lot of the debris you know that was going down into the nights as opposed to the newer base you put in there prevented that but then sometimes that gets plugged up right here it'd be great but you guys maintain it but yeah as long as it's maintained uh there's a gentleman that lives there on the lower one lower handling his driveway is completely underwater at times closet I don't know the residency I've seen residents that put down all the tree trainings which is brilliant anything else on this one yeah that's it we'll go on to 16th 16th that one dead ends are two part but it's again it's a drill every day and a replacement of the curving they remain as is the pretty much like 14. yeah any questions you're going to answer them 17th Street at the end mineral replated they paid and curve inflation leaving the pipe in place and also the the elements leaving those in place and uh pretty much repeating replacing the Curve so this ain't never getting close to my street which is the most important Street in this whole project oh we've got a lot of stuff if we hold that screen any questions or comments that's it this is Jody and I asked the question yes I'm sorry I think I can't see uh I can't see you on the screen or anything so I'm just having to just chime in whenever you'd like so sorry um but where we're leaving the inlets as they exist is there any way to add and break to stop like the Palm proms from flowing into them that's question number one question number two is will it be replaced in any of the concrete covers to them because many of those are failing for the ones that we're replacing the the Brand New England with the gray type talk the ones that are remain we've looked at I think if they're damaged and of course we would replace that Inlet if they're not damaged again we've just left it left it in and used ones but how do you determine whether one is ready to be replaced or not but it was the just I'm curious occasional inspection corrosion well you know their concrete you know these tops so they'll last for a while but if they look like they're spalling you know maybe the rebar is getting rusting and expanding you'll see you're crouching you'll see the red looks like it's like a fresh not fresh but it was a piece of concrete with no damage that and pretty much it's it's intact okay we had ones on 12 to 13 to actually collapsed in there I'm sorry I don't know I've made an answer for that and [Music] [Music] we are different that flows into them and that's adding a grade at the existing Inlet so instead of replacing the concrete pump with a great nursing keep in the same style like the curved style Inlet of putting some sort of grate to keep debris out of going into the box okay one of the short answers yes but I'm not sure if dimensions can it work without replacing the box that's that's what these things kind of piece together we've got the new box yeah and we don't want to have to pour a new bus but if if there's no top that's going to fix it in the after floor so 12 and 13 they had braids their different style they have a great um kind of like a almost a hybrid carbon one braids are so deteriorated that it's quality okay so you have to put your braces the reason I ask is because some of these the opening is large enough for a small child there there there's extremely unsafe it's you know we're talking about Community safety that's the problem and I know it sounds how do I get with Larry and kind of acting like that was a crazy statement but anything could be done um you know I know an Inception business I would just bring someone out there and build it anymore it's in a Big Field agree with something but it's something we probably should look after for saving purposes yeah I agree with you I think two things it would be safety I'd take my grandkids off of my street would walk across the street to the beach and we're going past that I make a conscious efforts to make sure that they are not even close to that because I have two two-year-olds and I'm confident if they fell they would they would go into that they're small enough to fall into that so you're visualizing what we're talking about there's some type of screen great for lack of a better term that would just go over that that would do two things it would stop a lot of the Pom-Pom stuff you know from going down in there from a maker stand once you see that cause and was there a problem so I should keep the openings big enough but stop getting blocked up too easily but agree right but once that goes into the system and then goes into the pipes does it ever get jammed up in there which you typically it's when the Barnacles the point that three is five wherever the pilot can move on I think the biggest inlets that we have that are come out they're not ours but the counties and adults the biggest ones that a child would fall around but that would definitely happen if we put some type of a grade over that you know I've seen it was fine it would stop debris right there similar to like the new rates that we put in on 12th and 13th Street that you guys have to go around after a big storm and make sure you clean that off otherwise the grade just gets blood right yeah and I've seen that kind of a design where they put some kind of grape in front of the opening curve of lead okay yeah the people think the goal is you know it's uh okay to have to clean out February but it's not okay to have to clean out right I agree yeah so right now a lot of that stuff is going into the system right A lot of it a lot of it does come out um but yeah that's we usually when you get that build up enough that it gets a full plug from like organic material like branches or something that's when you get that back up um and then typically what we do is the bad truck has to come out and go around blast it okay okay so we just we just contract that out yeah the county doesn't do that for us no okay they do maybe we can steal it can we just take another look at those grades and maybe try to wherever we're doing improvements look at trying to be uniform throughout the city I know our comparison there are there's one that's a huge I mean there's got to be 18 inches or greater that you can lose an animal about and there was ahead of people you know brainstorm and um you know I know we're not focusing on here since I'm just saying that there's one on here so there's got to be many throughout the city maybe take a second look at those in my balances we're doing this let's do it right so we don't have an issue yeah one of the issues that we may run into is if whatever you're trying to install permanently install a piece of Hardware like that into an older it may start crumbling and crack so it would have to be some kind of a highway device I think yeah I think we can put together um some options of whether we're you know finding a device that goes in front of it on what that would cost versus changing the Box on itself and then you can line up with the cost of all that would be you know those drains that are right there yeah so if we ask them to they can let me take that on yes so you save your eyes out of the safety reason we want these things taken care of well this is this is the two completely several projects one is you've got something that you would like to see resolved in the county is what we're trying to resolve tonight and whatever we come up with may not get the same solution but we can certainly asked anything else on 17th Street vice mayor are you okay with that yes okay 18th Street 18th Street and same work to Mill and replace and repaid replace the curtain and here uh at the end at the cul-de-set were uh replacing the inlets and uh and also the uh we're also removing the existing checkpoint there as well what's the purpose of that why are we relating to check them out well I think it's more of a case of relocating much more than just removing it and I think that the issue is a series scene when we have the check valve in at the inlet [Music] [Music] the reason it's in the box right now is because the pipe that's sleeved in the sea wall is it's a metal coordinated pipe that is falling apart and it's just impossible to get a battle in there um the way that the actual alcohol was shaped so we put one in the Box to prevent the title backflow when it would be much more beneficial and they have it to repair the the outfall so that the valve can be placed at the end of the pipe and that it also gives you more holding capacity and that's also a good point is that there's some alcohol set up we are replacing this being one of them where the CMP pipe is just totally corrected it's a little fully replacing those then they would be in check to take the check that out at that elevation okay any questions or comments on the 18th the uh the long mixed Advanced pipe that's going from the south Inland to the sea wall that's going to hear the slip line because that one has been inspected down infiltration [Music] so on 18th Street the only Inland that is there now this is just one right two there's two okay so that other one is existing but so it says so the 18 inch pipe that goes across the street there that's already there as well yeah okay and that needs to be cleaned out because the camera wasn't that that was full of three cleaned out okay well let me make one clarification I'm glad you brought that up it's a 15 inch pipe down we're going to replace it with an 18 deck it says proposed 18 inch back okay got it you wash it I thought you were gonna put the slip line in there so just slip on them from the last and right now to just see okay okay any other questions or comments on 18th it may help just to put that existing 15 inch mic yeah the part of the plans will be surveying the survey shows it is the 15th okay and uh but uh we can add that they're not so referred them to a survey as well okay all right okay 19th Street there were Mill and retake only replacing the curb and this is where uh it makes a job typically and and that's the existing pipe will be remained and the inlets looked okay so those will be remaining as well questions so what about Bayshore that connects 19 and 20th is that being to address at all it looks like I was done we were asked about curtain yeah so you know that that scored higher on our shooting that's okay so we or you can see where we ended the asphalt and it varies per Street that's Crossing Bayshore I mean that's been the of the the way that the damaged curve and as long that you know we took it to where it made sense to stop got it so this one bends around um on the a short wheel just because that curve was damaged yeah okay okay Tony uh on 20th this one uh heads at the park as well but it's uh mailed routine and replacing the curve there are no no pipes on this this stretch and I think it's that's pretty much silver until it stops here the painting just before it gets to um yeah it stops before where the containment is right [Music] question so most of these streets in this this area of Bel-Air Beach they're not really they're normal gutter spring is level with the grass and then you've got a concrete maybe just a little bit is anything changing on that or are we just doing the same thing again well if it's going to be the the valley type curve that's there and so the the edge of the curving concrete will be the edge of the pavement so it'll look a little different but in there depending on what the elevation is on the back side of that between the curb and the lawn there are probably be some sodium that will have to do in there to make it but it it'll look it won't look like it is now but it'll look like you see the valley curve is here next to your room okay yes ready for the next yes 21st 21st years we're doing Mill and repeating and curved replacement no fun no fun and and then the plans at the end you'll see some apples because of the pipe kind of in between the streets up in this area and so we at the end of these we've got alcohol plants that show up with the closing photos any questions are you doing I think you can continue okay thanks 20 seconds I brought up 22nd this is um at south east corner um we'll need military page it was part of the curve is sunk in and kind of puddles more so than any other place it's optional but I thought it would be out there because it was brought up when we did resurface why we didn't take care of that spot okay that's just is that okay so it's something I believe I know it makes a power it actually covers more than half the security content is an exact one solve the problem um so we'll make sure we don't uh I can't answer that straight on but it should okay and but we'll take a closer look at the survey and make sure this where it comes around that corner is going down to those inlets that's fairly down the street and so I let me check the grades on those but it shouldn't do it because it should fix it right and it's probably it's probably a combination of events happening but it's it's always in a torrential downpour yeah there's a brief period in time to where that intersection is underwater make sure that works on this one all right 23rd okay 23rd it's Middlebury day along with the curved replacement basically Bayshore is taking care of all the runoff yeah all right there's some out there at the 20th Street our street basically one of the midpoint of the street going through okay into the counties the other half goes away people said that wasn't it was a 2x15 that's what I wanted ourselves personally all right any questions about 23. all right okay 24. on 24th Street it's the same thing no longer in place replacing the Curve and another 385 [Music] um what is this 25th we're doing uh same thing we're doing a millet replacement and also replacing the Curve and here there's the park at the end of this street and the the intersections how this was there so we'll be curving around that as well okay all right because Okay Lori same thing we're doing the middle replacement of the pavement and the replacing of the Curve and there will will do the milling and the curb completion after radius turns to to hibiscus and we're stopping gifts short of fish and also just keep my eyes but there's the drainage improvements on this one is now what we're doing here here's an existing pipe that goes down from the intersection of the Hibiscus and that that paint that pipe is remains were also keeping in place the existing Inlet there and on Morgan and then it turns and goes that that is remaining as well a lot of what he's doing is it's got an indications articles out of that and that goes out to the sequence it goes outwear Optical sequel INE okay I believe this correctly yes are we doing anything with Victoria this is Victoria happened I was trying to figure out where is Victoria it's on everywhere yeah that's on the survey okay questions or comments foreign through it okay uh we're on the next page okay now we're at the out Falls and um here we've got 12 and 13. where we're indicating clearing clearing the barnacles and uh something that to help the Jews this is not on the last project where we talked about bomb records you know we come through others start buying come at me into these streets so do you recommend a slip line where my understanding is another pipe would actually go in there or cure it in place it's a slip line over here it's okay kit and uh at the the outlets that they're at 2020 Bayshore 2015. uh there again the main thing is to clean clean out those pipes and clean the particles away and that these are these two we know that there is damaged on where Washington from the inspection so I think I don't know if they said 2020 it may be 2205 yeah [Music] 22 05 27 and the other Outpost there's cleaning the Barnacles and uh the interesting thing that we're staying on 2205 and look at the video this has got a video uh you see where the pipe takes a turn it goes out to the sequel but the concrete pipe ends at the straight point and what they did is they've been to CMP come out to the Sea that [Music] you know that that outfall of needs to be there from that from Seawall to where the concrete height leaves it either needs to be slip lined or replaced it looked like it was okay it was so funny that small section there would because it really something needs to be done at that time is there a way right there at that intersection of the corrugated metal pipe and the concrete pipe yeah can it end there the position removed the CMD no because he'll be behind the scene okay so why didn't they just go straight shorter probably yeah okay what is your what is your recommendation you say something needs to be done here well what's the best solution my uh judgment on that is it's verifying the conditions so that the CMP and the level there's is not arrested but it's a sound and subclining would be recommend if that pipe is not sound the replace that section of CMP with the same material and then without the existing hole so people would fight the same just replace that section at night okay so um you just didn't you didn't Point anything out on drawing no this was late night study and making sure that you know we've you know we're reviewing is what we're showing and that's that's one that popped out last night and reviewing that in that and looking at that section we need we need to determine the types structural soundness and then then we can decide what to do okay it would be possible to see pictures of this also whenever you yeah yeah nice is there a is there a junction box there they actually connected yeah corrugated metal pipe to the concrete pipe yeah  uh would it make sense to put a junction box there and then put another concrete pipe replacing the corrugated metal pipe down to the wall is okay yeah so I think do something so we don't have any things here it is can you see that on the screen what you're saying right immediately right here let's begin this joint section of the concrete then you've got this pipe that goes out that once actually you can appears hard to see but that's where the Pipers CMP has been turned towards the scene so it looks good up until that point and the you know the video went out to the opening of the sea wall but we just got to make sure that that pipe there this section of the pipe that's in here that it's in good shape if it's in a good chain then the solution is are either sniff light up to the concrete pump for a place to find replace the corrugated metal body with light CMT I'm going to have to look at the old existing open it's easiest just to replace what's there looking at that section of the item that I get a CMP how far back is it from the opening uh this is about 12 feet it's not far so the other bushes there in Iowa we did put a manhole there junction box type of a deal they said because that area is sort of covered yeah most of these areas because not in the middle of the yard obviously well there's a there's a utility easement that exists on the flat but most cities around the property line and people here at walls fences drugs without going through illegal yes that's really the only one that's uh that has any real problems to it everything else was pretty straightforward yeah all right vice mayor Shirley do you have any comments no I mean in advance the frame that you can if there's any way to remove that pipe and put a the junction box in there I think it would be the best way to go but for that you know that's how we met today you don't know how old that is only the other late 60s early 70s you know we can look at those count your blocks or maybe a great Inlet and uh then they did a turn at that point so there's I'm just I'm just thinking that if it was cut and thing it's got to be rotten okay that's what I guess yeah because even if they welded it back in it yeah more than likely these these would be really easy place yeah all right just a reason not only the last comment is on a lot of these especially down Bayshore where we have the notes of clear articles to freeze I wanted to make sure like it when we thoroughly clean up these plants there's um that we have as an option to if we find that there is some damage at that time when we were doing 2013 and we discovered it just to have some money contingency money is set aside so that because we do identify a problem with the people while they're out there okay and uh just curious uh from the beginning again what time frame are we looking at on completion of this entire project Construction one and as soon as we can get it out do it started before November Seasons right here at this point it's going to be closer yeah because we have you know we're going to need at least a month but we're still kind of redesigning a little bit for the series this was a good idea and uh any other comments on this yes so there's very little pipe a new additional pipe that's going in is that an active Stadium right okay um was there any consideration for um that little pipe that we're going to be using for maybe a for HDPE as opposed to concrete pipe can you and short answers yeah you can't do particularly in these areas where we're not underneath the pavement I'm worried about hppe under pigment particularly here because it would not be if it was deeper but it's not that big deaf and you got the big trucks that come down I just want to I worry about how the htpes will respond to those loads at the depth so I don't have to look at that I know there's certain companies and certain types of acpe that are approved by fdot right that they put out on highways so pretty pretty large trucks there I don't know specifically what they require with the cover [Music] but it's the double wall yeah in a double wall so it's pretty strong it's been tested a lot well I can check in yeah so maybe we could have when they're when the contract is submitting a bid was the term I'm looking for that'd be great and they're asking yeah I wanted to talk about the asphalt because I'm a big reliever and you know we don't want to meet we want to do this to last as long as possible so what what's the best asphalt we can put on those Growers clearly most of our roads are automobiles however the biggest the biggest truck that causes those problems is the garbage truck because as stock goes stop goes stop go and if we have uh I mean I could drive around the roads now that would have just gone on 12 and 13. and there's a lot of heating and stuff going on there I'm sure it's from the garbage especially when it's as hot as it is I mean I don't know what type number they use for that but I I know like on Golf Boulevard and you see where it meets they have a lot of granite in advance so I don't know what that grade is my only I would like to see us use the best and strongest possible asphalt or at least get some different bids you can put air air airport grade down there but it looks like crap well I mean look at both Boulevard where they tie into our streets and that's been there for a while I guess at all but like you know so here it comes comes off the gold boom they cut it off and then our our payment starts and their payment is it has a lot of granted you can see it and that that really is a strong stuff that's an fdot correct right yeah they're using super pigs okay materials I think it's what that is and uh and that's I think the D.O.T started approving it like in the mid 90s 96 97. okay and uh but there is a topic because they call it super picking okay now I don't know how much it costs how much more is it different from the county standard payments which is the dlt's asphalt asphalt to come to be you know that what's the difference between that and the super page any any other brand but [Music] and then perhaps at that time you guys can tell us you know what's the benefit you know what's the what's the lifespan of One Versus the other so one last 20 more years just to pick a number but there's that information is out I can get that out of this word okay and and actually the difference between asphalt and super values how it's mixed right it's not a hot mix it's mixed it's a little bit different so in this kind of uh if you need even be coarse or fine print material right depending on how of course you went to your surface we can research here perfect appreciate it can I just add I just want to say though the FBO the key requirements or moisture what would remain in our interior streams and typically what you look after is that big rock and it's a lot it's a lot different mix you're right but it also is built to accommodate heavy traffic flow and we aren't filmed at a traffic flow in our interior growth so I don't want to I I think it's great to do the research but I think we just need to be careful not to spend too much money on the roads systems that you know what a kind of Alternatives you know is it appropriate for a residential Community Street you know what type of loads and traffic that we have there you know it's it's a lot different than I-275 in the paper that they put there it'd be a different paper the entire process is different as far as different Machinery right they're they're Centered for a long run it is different Machinery it is a different different way of laying the asphalt so is it appropriate for these streets that's that's what I've benefited out right I mean Gulf Boulevard I didn't see that late but I'm sure it was not very complicated but then to whatever pavement they put out there in Gulf Boulevard and it's it's strong and again I get it we have big 18 winners going on the interstate or since instead of the roads they're going you know 65 bonds an hour they're not stopping like these garbage trucks when they go to stop go hit the brakes every 20 feet that's a heavy load that's pushing on that soft dance mode right and that's what creates Heating and then you have hobbles and then you're wondering three years later you just did this exactly right you're underlying your face is really cool I'm sure the technology they changed asphalt is continuously changing in the different grades and they're working on it people way smarter than me now uh say yes because we know what we already use like the 12th and 13th Street so that yeah if you want something that doesn't work out you can do concrete but it wears it up to two says you have to have it hasn't handled over a hundred thousand cars a day 300 years before longer than us yeah yeah just over 400 a Time passport yeah concrete's 200 yards yeah it's concrete yeah concrete's it's less than that probably somewhere around upper 200 to 300 oh what's our average life expectancy on this project after it's done as far as roads um I mean do you look at some of our roads they you know they were paid in the early 2000s or so in good condition so again I guess it depends on like where like some of the base back is underneath and um just kind of things where we were only resurfacing of some problems or you know exist and then come back but I mean I guess I guess it's at least 20 years for the for the payment or more um but again kind of like we got some other factors too you know just things changing the long-term kind of the planning of kind of like beginners or another system so one of my fears is that if we ask for this various grades how do we know that they're quoting the same thing and so but I understand where you're going you want something that's impervious it's going to last in 50 years but at the same time I don't wanna skew the big process by asking a question and their interpretation of what we're asking for is completely different so I don't want to go too far in the Weeds on this uh I'm sure that the General job like this they're all sorts in their asphalt from Conway probably over in Largo on Sparky road is that all right again and they only offer one type of asphalt or yeah it's a couple different places yeah and usually you see what's the most common mix used in here you know the Pinellas County Lexus the Saint Pete the dot for this area they those guys know them all and and they're all very close so I guess in the bid process we should specify what makes this we're working right let me be that we do specify the next and the thickness and that's where if you want you can do an alternate um another mix if you'd like to look into like like a super bead but the I really don't think that that would be appropriate for a residential street we got to take into account oil junk 18 last month which may just cost us a fortune you know instead of strong all right if you have any other questions or comments or uh for the asphalt you know so you kind of see the difference between it not actually call it the bid unless you're serious about doing that cost increase for the higher period asphalt you know he he should be able to estimate based on that mix what what the call is different well he's going to be just like yesterday yeah what I like to see is you know the same mix that we use on 12 to 13. it makes sense and then see an alternate bid for an improvements that are engineering firm we think would be adequate and usable for our city streets that's better and that way we can adjust the cost differential if you're not doing something like that you just walk in blindfold what line with the city not want to see a better product that they could get that would just be a little small intimating costing and the only way you're going to know that is to vid it out and include an alternate bid so you can see it in the back I say nobody will want to do that it's a misuse of funding of the taxpayer certification I think a lot of people are going to buy contractors economy I'm not going to give you a fixed place get some changes all the time unless you're going to paint it tomorrow morning or within two weeks now they have to give us a place price for a certain amount of time very very close window you'll probably have a disclaimer in there and what keeps Rising you can have that I was involved with a lot of projects when the China Steel the answer yeah okay he paid concrete because that's involved with any more of the parking lots of streets you just can't believe it all right so can we just read your consensus on this you want to do you want to have a regular versus a premium or eggplant right yes whatever our engineering foreign a couple of times right yeah so then what uh but another upgraded asphalt would be to be used in our Rose so that you can see what the cost differential is and make a logical educated informed decision I was also wanted to know what we get for that right so I'm okay with that vice mayor Shirley would you like to weigh in on that on that conversation I agree we should have some comparisons and comparisons and competitive is or asphalt all right okay do we have any um any questions about these numbers anything like that so that's the cost estimates per design currently I'm sorry these are the cost estimates First Street area for their current design for this program what was the total um is with a 20 you tend to see which is more in our past projects we typically did 10. right now we're at uh 4.08 plan and what did we get approved by the Lending um it was two and a half roughly like 2.3 but that was on top of what we already surprised we're good well currently we're on the estimated budget all right that's great as long as we don't wait too long I can watch the prices go up okay um do we have anything else on this discussion before we move on Larry thank you so much thank you and uh thank you to your team also for giving us a great presentation and detailed documentation thank you thank you okay I'll tell you what it is 7 32 why don't they take about five to ten minute break and we'll come back and continue session [Music] we're on item number two discussion on strategic plan objectives for fiscal year 23 24 thank you mayor so this is the Strategic plan we went through over two meetings through each point and kind of made some notes and modifications and we left it off or this is before our first budget the workshop that we would come back and figure out some new objectives and that takes us to the last page in the back it we got the green and the red some of them there's there's objectives that are still working on for each goal and then you can see the reds or the number of twos we just don't have another objective currently and the idea when we come up with these objectives is we want them to fall in line with our budgetary planning for the upcoming years so um but we kind of left it at each councilman program you go home think about it come up with some ideas for the filming some of these blanks so we started goal one you got the health and safety we got two weeks to have still two objectives which was the address to mitigate the street flooding issues which is what we're currently doing we just did and uh to developed the street light plan so we have money set aside for Street lighting um like I've said in previous meetings I'm going to work on uh coming up with a kind of a standard not the city where we can improve Nursery lights focusing on our city students so for goal two um that's the best value for the taxpayer um we kind of so we constantly revisit the economic impacts on the capital Improvement budget and the reserve funds this is where we need another objectives um that falls online would be that's that's uh comments questions I'm looking at objective number two and I'm also looking at the entire tax dollar value gold too and basically what I'm seeing is that these are things that are we're currently doing now are we looking they are you looking for a new idea to add business or um there may not be currently something that we have to add it's just having the objective set is the goal or a point to get to for in the next fiscal year of reaching the Strategic goal so I don't know if you have anything that falls in line I really feel would be in the gold too so we were I know that council members Abel has he's still working on the marina plan and that is definitely that would actually fall in in this category I see it's listed here is that an objective that we should be able to analyst and consider something small well so so far to date as investment installed initially I mean we've kind of bounced it around quite a bit sorry I think about our week our everything is just Ashley at the end of the day is it changing our tax dollar value or is it for enhancing our tax dollar value or is it just streamlining the process yeah I'd say more so streamlining the process and it'll get more Equitable I mean because it's definitely an objective for us but um I'm a I'm not sure if it would fall under the tax dollar value as an objective right now if I just had to pluck something out of the air and plug into this I would say well that's what we're currently working on but exactly where it belongs anyone else like the chime in on that or am I mean vice mayor Shirley yeah I don't know that we can um that the marina is really a tax dollar objective in other words I don't know that there's much more that it's squeezed out of the marina on as far as revenues go so I look at this goal as a way Academy how do we increase revenues and like I mean maybe I'm off the base there but um and I think that looking more towards city hall right now kind of tapped out that's what I'm saying and looking at Grand so you know I I know there's been a lot of discussion about setting and Grant policies and maybe this is where we put that object that objectively go to setting up a grant policy procedure yeah I would definitely agree granted or always been one of our weaknesses since I've been with the city is very few and farther to me and whenever they do come along they're not confused but I've always wondered I guess we all have are we overlooking something because we don't either have to deal with the manpower to actually pursue these grants and maybe one of the things that we should be doing I think we've already briefly touched on in the past meeting was leveraging the uh the services of the Florida Legal cities because they have they actually have a service that we we tap into for free to help evaluate all the grants that are out there and see what's available for us um that seems like it would be low hanging fruit if somebody was was able to Spot It 'll know immediately if we were eligible have we no I have um we recommended I have signed up and um I want to see if they offer something more dialed into what we're looking for because when I decided for a program it sends me a weekly email so pretty much every possible brand nationally and there's ways to kind of sort search through it but I have not seen aspects of the program kind of like what you were saying or whether we'll actually do some some work looking for your community if that exists yeah I I want to say I wish that I had the guy with me but I want to say that they actually do have Grant running this business as part of as part of one of the benefits that we have it's just a matter of I guess paying the contacts and uh vice versa can I just add um and maybe Grant um in general may not be the ideal item for that but alternate funding for free nourishment and some of those projects that we know are Idols there on our goal is that we don't know how to find when we don't know how to make it happen so got to be on that goal somewhere and that tax what dollar value is probably a place to feed so the the you're talking about Beach readers yes yeah the problem with with going along on beach creators if we had to do it ourselves without our neighbors doing it it doesn't last very long and that's been some of the pushback that that I've received whenever I've been overly vocal to the county but we're going to bring that up I can go ahead and tell you that um Janet long announced at my first TDC meeting that the county is moving forward with planning and permitting to do the most needed areas for Beach nourishment and that would include Bellair Beach so this should be something that we won't have to worry about but unfortunately whether we did it or they did it for the FED data we're still looking at two years out before anything actually happens um two years yeah and August uh year on record for I think since like 33 or something like that and it's a powder k out there and we're now in the most danger that we've ever been in as far as the setting for The Perfect Storm because two entities were waiting to see who is going to believe first so it's uh it's it's sad that we've gotten to this point but I do think that the county is now they have their eyes on bigger projects that they consider far more important than each nourishment such as the Rays stadium and I told them I told [Music] otherwise I think people are not going to people are going to completely disapprove and uh big formal local than I am so hopefully we've got some relief coming soon total ridiculous this new stadium raise the role on an average of 18 000 a night message another team of people come down here to use the beach to go to all right I hear you yeah I mean well it's uh at the end of the day we know where all that bad tax money comes from and it's a minimal investment I hate that the county and reinvest it into their sin but if they don't do it I don't think anyone else is one more thing on that and then I'll we'll continue on the Army Corps of Engineers is coming down to do a small presentation and Q a down to Treasure Island and I am that so that I can I don't have the exact date I will I will I don't know who's invited if it's a regular public meeting or not but I will find out all right uh vice mayor Shirley would you like to continue I'm sorry I got my little leaked version right there into that section okay um so just that's all different funding okay grants and alternative funding or or just you can we can just call it Ultra funding and subjective to everybody agree with that city manager yes so uh goal three that's the communication and Community goal currently we still have and we're you know we're looking at it is just to studying the intersection that kind of um you know backs up it's you know there may be nothing that can be done to it but it's just the county offered to do further studying and take them up on it just to see if there's any kind of solutions to make things better for the residents so we saw that on there and like I said they they have their numbers in the uh firm that does their uh their actual study and calculations is it told me it's probably about almost a month ago there's a couple months so we'll see what kind of come back with the after the change was made which was I think 2018-19 or so when they kind of restructured the lanes maybe it might have been as this means 20 but um kind of see what the results came back [Applause] um and see if there's any other way we could improve so that being said I know when we talked about uh communication the website has been brought up um there was you know some checking into uh attorney more with the just making sure everything's uh I guess ADA Compliant but we did talk about the possibility of putting in more uh forms Online requests functionality with our website to make it like what the stream parking so yeah once Attorney Morris uh you know kind of checked out and reviewed what um what he thinks we're going to be at and what we can add and what will keep us compliant um that's something I can continue to to grow on the website is the online Forum functionality of it for people that don't always have time to either come into the building or call them and they're in office hours to get things done all right speaking of that are you are you satisfied with our web hosting company or are you having to figure out tools on your own or are they are they making suggestions to improve on that because they're a lot of times that those utilities have the bolt-ons let's just call them or your a lot of times things are just out there but you don't know that and you shouldn't have to but they certainly should and so I'm just part of going back to my question are you satisfied with the clinical service we're getting out of them or do you need something better well we talked about town of Bel Air's website and I did reach out to Civic plus because that is who they use I I spoke with top of all our staff first and I found out who they who they worked with to design that website that person is no longer working in our area but I have a meeting set up with someone from specific plus to discuss what you know what it would take to recover to design more with theirs and you know see what see what their price points are so I want to I want to see how that comes back it comes to our current website provider with WordPress you know I think it's probably it's a local option I think you're in St Pete Beach and it was probably an economical option but as far as really giving ideas to improve our website I don't they don't do much of that now if you ask them specifically I'd like to accomplish this task and you know how can I do that and they they will work on it for you for it but there may be some better Solutions or companies that bring us more up to speed okay it's so good that's a that's a good example for goal number three objective two but I'm wondering if objective one is really should actually be in that category because I don't see that in your description of a credible timely and transparent information paid back between the city and residents into their pride of ownership including inclusion and civility I don't I don't see any connection that was just under that goal I don't know how it was connected previously um what do you think it's uh and this is this is uh could be objective three of goal number one okay [Music] [Music] anyone I think a utilizing a website once it's really designed for communication and then visualizing any other leads you have I don't know we're not doing any text messaging or anything like that but there's certainly um some boom and I really don't like getting into social media aspects of things but certainly there's a lot of bad information on social media and a way to combat some of that to provide the city Side of what's really going on versus what the gossip is um social media so I I don't know how we tackle that but I think it needs to be an objective because it is a Cause a lot of extra attention when it's not necessarily information I agree I don't know if it's I mean we know really we know there's one general area where this miscommunication is is uh this I would call it miscommunication it's almost a disinformation and also just a a way to to indirectly try to steer the council but I don't know if it's actually worth trying to combat that anymore than we do in our meetings no matter what you say there's always going to be somebody that uh that will take those words and turn them around but I definitely like the idea of doing the work on Auto page and we're currently doing currently I think all we're doing right now is announcing our meetings I think that's a plug-in through the website to anytime because we're putting something officially it just automatically gets transfer those fees but I would like to see whenever we complete these projects I would love to see a picture of 12 and 13. I'm meaningful it is I'd love to see every time one of our streets we've done how beautiful it is you know I'll show him the community that progress is leaving our community and there's more than just announcing the meetings I'm sure if you look at our meeting right now but what do you think there's three people watching 15. you got two yeah okay and they're both in the same household I will I will I will say it it's I've noticed that it's much easier for people to find their information in the next door post or a Facebook [Music] music [Music] vice mayor Shirley is is that in your house I'm here the commute it I'm muted okay it's all right it's all right okay um anyway it's much easier I've noticed that the habits of people it's much easier for them to read something real quick and form their opinion rather than listening to one of our meetings or listen to a recording or watching it on a Youtube video um I I don't know I don't know how to combat that because anyone can take whatever they want and turn a Twist on it but I think it's probably not a bad idea to have some kind of a salary at the end of our meetings what did we discuss it's kind of like the minutes but maybe maybe you take 20 minutes after a meeting and give the city manager summary or something like that and in that way there's another location that people that he can go look and get the story because that's what's missing in this communication problem is that there's only one source right now and it's the source that doesn't like anything that we do it's it's just what it's turned into it vice mayor Shirley no I agree I think that's a good plan is to try to have somebody path or something but certainly if you know presented on a social media post that would be helping the one thing that I don't want us to get into and I wish council member zabel was here because I'd like for him to hear this is is that if you decide if you're going to be the messenger for the city in a public forum where it's becomes records requestable you may be setting yourself up for something bad in the future so I don't think it's at all a good idea for anybody on the council to be the official messenger for the city of Ballard page and and I I hope that maybe once you come up with something Kyle's bit and he won't need to do that anymore because that's the last thing I want things for him wind up in some sort of a legal battle because he's having to go find something that he's he doesn't have so um just my two cents on that yeah um we have our city you know let us know as you know not everybody voluntarily signs of to be part of it I think mainly because of the public records aspect of it but then again you know I think that the topic on some of the email glasses are trying to reach more people but we can't necessarily that because sign up and that would be voluntarily doing that [Music] um when we talk about the next door platform I I would like to do more research especially with some of the larger organizations I don't know how they do get involved on that are we not I would not recommendations [Music] more controllable Facebook and our website I think that that I think that would be more than enough and it doesn't require responses it just needs to be coming from somebody for a city official um so doing a little more of this already because we try to some of the success element stories we try to capture the newsletter I think Patty does a good job in doing that I don't want to um I like the idea of like meeting summary I think that it could help people give them something shorter to follow um on a regular basis right that does make sense I just don't want to try to um like says she does she puts so much effort into the newsletter they even get that somehow out there you know so they're not redoing kind of the same thing I think the summary of the meetings I mean we have these lengthy conversations back and forth but at the end of the day we we increase your consensus on something and it's this is the direction we think we're going on this particular topic and it doesn't have depth of who said what or anything like that but just a general gesture this is it looks like this is the direction I think tonight we talked about the drainage plant okay we discussed the drainage plant there's all the streets that are going to be impacted States here you know things like that and uh I know it's the last thing you want us more on your plate but I still think that it's something that would help the student of news about Miller Beach all right and we don't want regarding involved in something that we put you know factual you know everything that our news out there and then have it be a foreign I don't think in the history of ever been persuaded by a well-woried social media post um but the added element for you folks as it challenges that as you explore new platforms being mindful of the public records UH responsibilities and challenges that come with that whether it's just it's enough to retain your post but if it does have a threat element onto it or a comment threat element your ability to retain that as a dynamic record because from Monday to Wednesday maybe nobody comments on Thursday somebody does and then nine months later somebody does again and what is our ability to to retain that record into that thing to present a challenge it's all its own I think that the more you stay within the platforms that you're can control and on are more accustomed to that may be best understanding I'm coming at it from the legal side and not the political side of trying to reach the most people the easiest way all right so um back to objective number two in the goal number three we have any other suggestions other than the uh other than the website I actually would include your platform we need to revisit this later give everybody some time maybe email them yeah no I think I got it just go over it objective one being the let's say um you know we're in container looking into uh you know who we're using and how it's designed to see if there's another way to do that and then also what we can do in-house things that I will say that Patty's newsletter nice looking woman and it always is very nice and professional thank you sometimes I get help what's that I said sometimes I get help and I appreciate it and then for like two months like we just talked about kind of coming up with we had you know the facts directly from the city yeah I think that that would work a little Rehab on the website and then uh just faster delivery of what are we doing what we talked about last night vice mayor Shirley are you okay with that yeah that all sounds good to me okay I just keep calling on you because I don't I don't know if you're raising your hand or if you're uh not all right uh continue okay so goal four that's the aesthetic gold and that this uh is created by very well planned well maintained appearance for the city that donates our sense of community or denotes our sense of community and our quality of life and our first subjunction objective we have is the golf ball polymer beautification project of course we know is underway it's going to take some more time obviously for the to get the complete design completed but we are looking for a second objective to relate to the aesthetic factor and goals of the community first thing that comes to mind for me is uh containing code enforcement I mean it's uh that's what keeps our our city beautiful now the car is not parked in the streets Lawns are nice little manicure trees are trend are you bringing that up reminds me of just last year um it was October when we went through this we talked about it coming back around doing another survey it doesn't follow up to what we've gotten so yeah can I add something you sure can and um can we also add you know just reviewing the value of I mean I know where we went through and we've been paid somebody throws the roads are beautiful but created upon me and all these valuing herbs and we've got issues throughout the city where the painting has been begun so we could just make it sets that and add that as a objective important and this is for repair yes after Paving we created the issues with standing water and those Allied Parts throughout the city so that would be an objective three of them or do we want to toss out code enforcements and make this art because we're doing code enforcement all the time anyway I think it needs to be objective because I know of several areas where we've got stripping Paul potential where the water stands so long that it's creating slime in the valley curve and potential problems for residents to save them under the storm water Improvement issue talking about slime well I think it does for what we're currently our product now and if you go through the plan to see and made a point in our meetings that that we need to spec out the curving um really Define what our expectations are um you know you're always going to have given our elevations it's going to be hard to have the most perfect system because they work on a lot more fall in a lot of the newer developments but we still get stuck it out in a way to show what blood water and product to be to make sure that we minimize any kind of policy you know it's interesting also that I I actually see the resurfacing of our streets as part of the unification because if you look at one that's just been done and the person's one that hasn't been done in 20 years and I mean it's night and day it's just pops and you see this done so it's funny how this storm water project actually does a lot for the beauty of our community a lot of facing the curves and the paid in the streets it can almost fit right into Statics also consequences of these valid terms work fine until okay with the streets and didn't do anything to the valley first ever existing and now we have standing water so we've created some problems on some streets that haven't been correct so is this Aesthetics or would you consider this public safety and health oh and then I I would challenge to say that that what you're talking about Falls right into the aggressive mitigate Street flooding issues it's just a different type of flooding I I would agree it's just wasn't discussed when we're talking about flooding so I don't like to be able to look okay because we think these words are gone and they're not all right I got you okay so then we would script that out and go back to code enforcement I guess because can anyone think of anything else that we could plug into a standards for objective too to go just continue code enforcement if anyone thinks of something else let's see man so the last goal is still five Beach water which is preserved and protect our City's natural Beach and water the front environments and we obviously have a feature nourishment and how it comes to Beach and water but the the discussion of you know saving money up from through the city to purchase a boat to do maintenance on the hardware side primarily and that's that would become useful for maintenance of our soil our outfalls throughout City ending as well as our markers that are out there from for the uh wake zones and the uh also the piling signs that we have in the south side of the city so I mean whether or not what our ultimate decision is on that purchase I think that that kind of when we talk about strategic planning a line on budget budget Linings strategic planning like kind of close to my money Council well there is the beach that's the problem it's it's an ongoing project every six years I think really I thought the original thing in the spot yes I will enter more information um it's 10 counties that are being that are basically having this problem I spoke with representative Luna about this and um I want to get her take because she's been working really hard trying to get the Army clearly changed that also and in fact she said that now there's a turn number one probably more than anything else is she's focused on is in the Army Corps to change their mind and the way that she's planning on doing it is there's a way that um I believe it's next year not this year but next year they're going to change some language and on the books that will prevent it'll basically take the power away from the Army Corps to do what they're doing in the meantime this year the Big City Mayors voted all together to allow her to do here was the name [Music] of I can't remember the name of the rule but it's basically it's a tool that they have to strip the funding of operating so she's actually going to see if she can if she can spend that through and be fun and the individuals that are responsible if the nation has had but I think at the end of the day we're probably not ever willing to get that funding again because federal government and 100 on our regions no one can say all right this is maybe she'll have good luck with it I I think there's too many Supreme Court vacations that have a property Marines residents the problem is is the align with their drawing in the sand from where where they want the easements to go some of them are Beyond are being kind of water and they come right up into people's backyards and they're they're available to do it because it's perpetual if it was a two-year theme or something like that they might not be more receptive to it but the problem here today the last time they did an ACL was probably 15 20 years ago that did it you know we've had so many Beach storms and of All Ships taking away sand these private owners have never established or replenish their sand their Supreme Court cases stop the features right across the state saying hey you lost your property on it and I'll tell you we live in an area where we don't have 19 blocks of nourished since I've been here way before but look at the topography two years after the featuring nourishment it's all leveled out all that sand just bills writing and our neighbor in town gets free public sand right there and owns the stuff well the reason why that happens is because they don't believe the reason why they don't get it is because they didn't have any public land to give or party and I say that's argument can be addressed because if it's three of each access lives and everything like that that access to the responses absolutely [Music] you know and we should not have what we did enough program today amen I think the biggest problem is that the Army Court should have just done it anyway all the way down the beach and not skipped failure but that's that's another story and uh that's something much bigger than all of us vice mayor Shirley you were gonna you were going to chime in on Sunday before yes I just wanted to add on the beach and Waterfront that we need to what we're doing our code regarding become our warning policy and restrictions within our jurisdiction of course we live and a waterfront community of Pentecostal and Beachside and we need to put into place in our public some restrictions to vote forums and things in that patient and I think that should be part of our plan our strategic plan is it enforceable at all absolutely because we've got the right code in place such as I'm being critical pumping out your boat that's been sitting there for three months rather than you know those votes are just popping off aboard so there's feces wrong pieces on our Shores and no one's doing anything up and that's where I understand what you're saying I say the same thing as the giant houseboat out there right now that um that I'm pretty sure people are living on and then there's a yacht just adjacent to that the houseboat and I know I see people on that one every day and I I don't see them leaving so they're living on that boat and you're right they probably are pumping out right into the uh into the ocean um so that's only been here what a couple weeks now even two weeks is too long yeah oh I'm not saying yeah I'm not challenged but that's because there was another boat out there that brought up to me and I think it's really nice it's been there for like two months yeah let me see it like we're slowly becoming uh Belair Bluffs that's what's happening they're they're slowly filling it in over there and we're gonna lose control of it what's going to happen if we can't figure out a way to stop it but I don't know yet I have to hear a good coffee I can tell you I meant I've mentioned this several times they keep left they require proof or pump out equally and if you don't have it you can move along um and that's but you have to have a votes to reinforce that code and if we aren't able to enforce the code group of the place so I'm just suggesting that we start getting serious about it before we have a problem well that would be a sheriff's enforcement not us see this whole series right so how much do we want to bring them on for sure what I could what I could add to this dialogue is that you know especially as we um we have so many communities up and down our beaches there are practical limitations to enforcement whether those be first just jurisdictional or they are waters you know even though we can see them from parts of our community are they in fact our Waters to patrol and enforce upon if they are our Waters do we have the resources or to the extent we rely on Community Partners do they have the resources are they willing to commit to doing those things sometimes the answer is no or it will eventually that's just not the highest priority and I'm not it's no way impuning pcso I just mean in general um you have when you're working with Community Partners they have their own priority lists Etc um so I can tell you other communities have approached this I'd be interested um member surely to know more about that Key West example and we can talk offline because one of the challenges I've heard in in other communities is the issue of your territorial Waters where you're enforcing um it's one thing if you're talking about somebody Mooring just off of your Marina or you're more in field it's another one they're just out in the middle of intercoastal and what your ability is to go out there and say Hey you know Bella beach has a problem with this even if you're not in down their Beach proper so just some concerns but as far as you folks go with golden objective setting you do as you wish and we will of course provide you whatever information research you need to make the policy that flows from your goals and objectives all right so as far as goal of five what we should actually do I don't really know a beach green original is uh is something as much of a city as you as I mean it definitely it impacts us all but as far as the day-to-day responsibilities and what city manager reefer is having a few uh accomplish in his list of goals uh is speech nourishment should it even be on this list of course there's something on the outside that that we're all trying to deal with to help the city but we're not we're not funding it we're not this city will never get a drop of sand on itself it's just not you'll never get to permit it you'll never if you want to go Jay or whatever you're never going to get any of that they aren't because the permitting is required by the Army Corps and even now with the county designing their plan they're basically copying the Army course plan and they're going to have to apply for permitting through the Army Corps the difference is is that we're not asking for any money instead we're going to have to do it on Saturday you know ourselves with our bedtimes you know that happens we have to fund it that way well then we just don't get some things on our cash cow keep it alive and fed well so my question is should this be objective one or should it be something else I think the votes are really recumbing a major issue and I agree with vice mayor Shirley is an objective one or is or uh being objected to the future nourishment I think goes in addition to the beach and the natural Beach it goes into tax value too if we don't have Beach beachfront property and the tax value goes down considerably um but it's just storage for my goal for the city is it anything that we can accomplish yes I mean we pretty much are at the mercy of what happens between the fed the state and the count yes absolutely so it's still a goal he's saying like a great time minimum official rely on retaliate to it with a suite it's available you know we typically do it all the one time that they come through we had already picked up it was this second third wave they kind of helped out with the things I saw contractors on there but Dave so I'll tell you firsthand by the time they came through it had already been picked up and I'll tell you what the county was for whenever you look at Treasure Island Saint Pete Beach um the fingers in those areas you could walk on the fish there was so many again and that's where the county came in and that's where you get your that's where you get some of your tax revenue back whenever they're cleaning up a disaster like that they didn't spend a lot of time here because it was management and we were able to actually do it I would much rather than be down there and helping those people then come out there but we're situated in a certain way to where geographically most of the big catastrophes it seems to be south of John's Pass it seems to be worth it I drove through there one day I'm not kidding it looked like tomatoes to the water the Waterman now from behind my boat as I go through it it was thick Orange I mean there it was a skimmer it was all the way to the ocean floor everything was orange the equipments included and that's that's what the County's been taking care of so yeah they we do take care of our own in that case but I'm sure that there's always a possibility they can be worth so back to goal five Terry would you like to be objective on the boat well I think um you know I mean I find it that's a good objective one but I think we still need to keep key even though we can't do a whole lot because the future nourishment it still needs to be a priority on our list and um and so I think it should stay on there as something we should focus on okay well we'll leave that one on there they won't make the uh the boats as objective too if everybody's okay with that I will say this is the beauty of Bellaire Beach we've got goals but they're they're modest and we don't we don't have huge problems in this community that's that's one of the blessings of living here is if you put the same list in front of the bigger water or St Petersburg or the county it will be overwhelming so we're very fortunate all right is that a good start for you yes would anyone else like to add on to this conversation before we move on to item number three once going twice all right so we are on zero item number three which is placed on here by Mr Roberts yes discussion on maximum parking time limits take away Mr Roberts thank you sir yeah many of you may have received an email a Chatman Academy closing it doesn't matter and that was followed up with am apprecially yeah so I actually had a phone call with him and it just it's just a conversation brought up my question which is I know I mean it's always good to kind of like take a look at these things or sit in place and see if we can tweak it if it makes more sense or just leave it the way it is but and I talked with um Kyle and he checked on the report and the question was do we have very many people that are parking at Boardman Street and then once they're three-hour time limit expires they jump in their vehicle and move it down to the marina set up so it's three hours at each location not three hours period which of course we could make that change when you thought that made more sense we could just say you've got three hours and either important Street or City Hall like we could do that if you thought that made sense so the real question is do we think that three hour period that we decided because I started thinking as I was talking to them I can't really remember why specifically remember three hours so that's really a big question are we good with three hours do we feel like we should adjust that or did we feel like we should leave it at three hours for I think I can kind of recap what happened um basically we have limited parking for our community we have the three of the three Feller Shore areas that we have Marty Morgan Carr we have the residents of Miller Beach were not able to find Targets tomorrow so they get a boring part to be pulled well then they would have to go across the street to find parking and uh we decided that really we're doing what the minimum requirement to offer public parking for non-residents and things what's that 40 is a good three hour man well I'm not saying that it's we're just required to give public art to provide a public market [Music] and so what happened was uh you had people that were that were coming here they were paying on minimal fee and they were going to the beach and the parking lot was filling up and even whenever we allowed an all-day array you were able to fill the meter or originally we had a limit and what was happening was I think we had minimum three hours and then they would just walked back over and they put they felt like three more hours okay okay well we just didn't want that and so we tried to figure out a way to make it inconvenient to come spend the day at the extension wine race if you were not arrested now this gentleman sent the email and he said he's and So I responded to him and I said fine go to the City Hall pay five bucks and you can park all you want year round to hear another thing he's not arrested yeah I specifically he didn't say it in the email he was a recipe for residents he said the residence yes he didn't say like like I agree with you right he didn't say I'm a residential yeah he would take it so I specifically asked him are you a resident ability yeah and I I told them when I say that and I explained the whole thing about we dream artists giving up to Morgan Park and I said you know a lot of our residents don't go to the beach until 11 o'clock 12 o'clock pork lunch so he said to me says well did you ever consider the first come first serve I said yeah I said that's why we put the three hours in there just because our residents pay through the parking lot pay for the upkeep the only reason we open it up to the public was because it was an encouragement and now we're not getting it it's actually been on the table to pull Park all day for five bucks yeah but you know we look at it like we have six feet and 12th Street and 19th Street those loss I don't think I've ever seen yes well it's different there are a different respiration that you cannot open them up so one of the street is the one and I get that the people that live on the um foreign right I I would say that if they're driving over anywhere they probably shouldn't come up over the same keyboard just because again if you look at the North side there you're very little they're released nowhere to go and I hate to say it but they live in Santee and they have a giant Park in fact thousands of parking spaces and a big huge wide beach oh yeah and it's not it's not disintegrated their beaches Pristine from here to ours yeah because they have a great so whatever it is we've lost ours but they've almost kept all of theirs it's a little thinner as you get a little more North but you start getting anywhere near there near that Park but so really my question was is this something I just wanted to talk about here that we want to change the three hour to a different number or do we want to even drill further which I guess doesn't make a lot of sense because if we're three hours period so you can't move to the marina and give us more money I don't really have a problem with it moving to the Marines and the reason why is because um it's not open that's what I'm sitting here before but I don't want to give them all day parking either so right how's her how's her record since we've changed it it's still coming in yeah so he's throwing up [Music] I mean I got one of my friends came up to me he lives in water you know he gives his money to drop off without a sheriff the boys dropped them off in six years the sheriff said hey this is for our degree transplants yeah that's right so we're good with leaving it vice mayor Shirley would you like to chime in on this topic I would agree to uh potentially extend it another hour the four hours with the Papillon that we reserve two spaces for City residents like we used to at Park and park since we're not getting future nourishment and they're not picking up their end of the deal why are we picking up off our parking yeah unless you have a sticker [Music] yeah until a few years back the last three years now I'm I'm fine with leaving it alone keeping it the way that it is what about let's just do an informal survey Frank we really would it is asking for is that two spots that would say remember each citizens are only working at work they use like a sticker I don't I think that you have an important absolutely already have an enforcement problem in the regular well that's fine 6-12-19 is it okay if we just leave this one alone support of taking back two spaces and I have been it's been a big issue for me that we do not have Resort spaces or residents at Oregon Park and I think when you go back to that okay well if right now the majorities is leave it alone up for the two spots there we've changed so it's a it's a 50 50. oh just here I think all the blend is that I think the consequently is is Belinda because they were speaking up on my behalf okay all right uh well we will we'll just move on on this one and uh right now vice mayor sure I'm just curious this is purely for my own information are we are we completely filling the parking lot with pain with parking tickets paid parking rent or um I'm sorry I don't know if I didn't hear what you said I'm just wondering how often are you going over there now and it's completely full anytime on Saturday and Saturday if you want to stop there and not there is not parking for residents and it's the only uh lot with facility so if you have a small filter with you kind of important do you think that it would be enforceable we thought it was that way for many many years I've been here for 23 24 years and it wasn't until the last three nurses we gave out all those spaces and won our part okay so um do you think we could just get away with putting up two signs and call it a day yeah it's no different than what Indian Rocks beef does they have they have reserved spaces for their residents who have kind of sticker they're pumping those places and on the question how much would it cost for a fine air whatever I parked my car how much the importance maybe of course I don't think I don't think we could say but it's all right now it's probably cheaper than 55.50 yeah it's probably so I'm going to pull on that spot I'll pay you 55 dollars okay I will stay there for six hours if you uh if you're if I mean we have directors we can issue the directive to to the police to control the response what I'm saying is if I get a ticket I'm going to stay there for five to six seven hours or maybe even it depends on how soon the police detect you there but because we don't have to tell me yeah they still don't want to give it a ticket though and then we get one ticket see now in those spots we could enforce Hillary we couldn't make those throwaways thank you come here for the whole day well that would be one way to make sure that it didn't happen right that Tollway Zone Bellaire Beach residents home yeah did this change anyone's mind totally don't don't like beach residents only I think that will really messes up for future Nursery it would definitely a great contract even if we were even if we said Miller Beach residents home yes when we did the I think we raised ten thousand dollars it doesn't matter it's professional it's done we never will get that back we could never get out of those instruments yeah we're done so that being said you're I like your idea Jody but I I think it's not doable I think that's the problem that's that must be why I went away I would give a whole right side of the validity [Music] I agree but um you know once you sign something away whether you made a bad deal or not it's really there's no obligation on their part to continue doing it the first is what we have because that's what it is because through the city yeah I can provide that up I have notes um I think it was first problem when was here um but there's no some emails but I could I could send the documents to everyone so I think you could call the county it's their experience but it's it's I don't it doesn't belong to the Army Corps he's the county the agreement the uh the Perpetual easements the agreement that was it specifically says that would provide so many parking public accounting that's what I'm saying I'm not sure for signing the easement there's something somewhere that says this is what you must do yeah okay all right uh well I'll tell you what we'll look into it and then we'll discuss it again at the next work session let's see uh See if the exchange our minds or if we can do anything to uh to help us everybody okay with that yes all right cool sounds good all right now we are on to um General business uh so um yes I got some things whenever yeah sorry okay um so I put oh I I sent an email out um it was on August 8th it was uh before we could almost reach out to me because during our comp plan review with the planning is on the board it was brought up at some of the annual traffic counts they were concerned that the way they did the counts that it possibly didn't reflect our peak hours during the day when the traffic's the highest and because their accounts are more focused around the commuter traffic in the county and um people and Reserve planning the zoning board felt it uh traffic patterns could possibly be different in dollar division they requested that possible for Pinellas to do some specific accounts for Bellar Beach to to make sure that that it falls in line or that we get to correct information so uh Linda Fisher who you know has presented here for a town playing reached out to me and asked them if we do want these studies done that we need to read the requests uh to the um the weight plan is the executive director for it but now let's be happy to do them so I sent an email out to the council trying to just get a consensus if that was agreeable to each member of the council I heard back from three out of seven so I just wanted to bring it up because I'm I'm interested in doing this um because I think it's something that they will provide for us and they might give some insight into the traffic patterns here in color of each I uh however I would greatly appreciate this city having the opportunity to um a career history with their ultimate decision of what they think is best for us because they may be wanting to they may come up with a plan that we absolutely hate and don't want to don't want to consider it such as maybe something we've already done in the past workouts or say they come back with yeah we need to rip out this island and the crosswalk you know those are some things that I think I think I'm one of the one of those fine because yeah I'm interested but yeah I'm sure they know we don't yeah and that was never brought up in this it was it was more along the lines of just making sure that our patterns uh were in line with the rest of the studies that they're doing um and and if you remember in the statistical section over the Counterpoint it gave ratings on the kind of congestion of the major roads which are around Causeway Boulevard and we were pretty much the worst rating and actually I think North Golf Boulevard instead of an Africa like an e it was like the second to worse rating which didn't actually line up with what you would think so it was kind of requested that we at least do the studies and see if um if they are rated that bad and then take that information and try to use it foreign so I heard back from mayor a member of Livingstone and remember Roberts shame over what I said I didn't do anything [Music] okay uh Mr Roberts you okay with the study oh yeah thank you all right Belinda yes I'm still doing that all right it's not going to be a resolvable problem unless you the subway okay all right anything else yeah we got our uh insurance quote if it's running in today came in um late last week and I was notified today um if if you go through line by line you start with the general liability coverage that increase our premium went up 17 percent the Cyber liability was only five percent the auto liability coverage went up 12. the autofocused with average coverage were four the big one like projected was the property coverage of 198 8 so that you know we we plan on 75 that actually went a little higher workers compensation actually just went one percent uh so overall our total freedom went up to four percent it is close to what we budgeted based on how we spread out uh 10 on certain line items at the 75 on the property but this is this is the code and they provided some material with some explanation but they I did talk to the representative from the foreign she is willing to come and answer questions and talk about it I feel you know we should probably take her up on it it's just an explanation they feel it's Justified and they care that you know they're offering to answer questions I'm sure that Mr Baker has plenty concerning issues um if this space becoming almost unbearable to live with everything I just read that lawsuit again today she's saying no why is he called some materials and everything like that yeah it's proven how do you explain 98 okay a 2x4 is 98 higher than it was this is this is price gouge 101. I mean I I builtmore estate rep she has gotten back to me on the win insurance and everything like that it's just it isn't it's coming in uh some of these prices have gone down and these rates will just keep going through the roof what I can tell you is that insurance is one of the number one priorities of something else with the Florida League Mayors the Suncoast Omega cities everybody's everybody's hurting in the same way and so uh yeah thank you I don't know how I wonder why it's at home here because they have such Deep Pockets because your insurance bill is going to be if you live on the beach it's going to be fifteen hundred dollars now just minimum a month more than your house payment if you have whatever I'm not talking about taxes or anything else I mean it's just I I I've Had State reps say to me oh this is going to kill the property members and kill us because rely on attachments so I need an answer but what's the solution I don't think that there is one uh I don't know and you have to keep the Ouija board up um so the explanation I got was I'm counting on a double head uh when it came to last year being one of the date we surveyed our assets they did the five year every five years they survey the assets so we kind of were up for the what did you guys get now that we have to insure so that kind of hit us at the same time that we had [Music] another factor is they are offering a specific asset service per asset and also a blanket coverage and I guess in some of the situations in the cities they got hit they had specific asset coverage they weren't updated enough where um they had the proper insurance so they from four League of cities and gets decided through that and they were going to cover all cities in the future what I like to ask her if she came here is you know this is property insurance okay so the storm hits okay when you have to have a win insurance policy we have to have a Hurricane Floyd they would say that's not our responsibility okay it's property you've got to see your blood go see your wing all right but you're still gouging the hell outs just like just like the typical homes you know no one's explaining this to me saying well yeah we have bad storms yes we do but you don't pay out on these bad storms now you jump on the bandwagon you jump on the band bandwagon of FEMA and jump on the back when I get a Citizens or whatever like that but you're not showing the actual because of these damages now I'm sure there's going to be a lot of uh people lighting up their home to just have homeowners insurance that insurance probably absolutely that's the way work that hasn't been that hasn't been the fact it's just really there's no need for this that's saying that this is actually what was costing us money that's yours well we did reach out to the other oh yeah I will say that um so whenever I was walking around at the Legacy for that I had this bunch of ribbons for all the programs that we've anticipated in different classes I've taken yeah it's a little bit embarrassing because there were some people here like you know what I did notice was the very first one I believe was I was an fmit and um not everybody there had that was wearing that rhythm so that tells me that on everybody's using the league of cities insurance and um it's probably in our best interest to reach out for another employees just to see I spoke to an Eric Clark and I just really had that mitas [Music] so you're right that's a lot about that right now well they just told me that they knew they couldn't compete right now well and that's a fair way and it's just a giant funding that they're collecting and they're selfish foreign [Music] but uh I would always be willing to look at other quotes if they were kind of originally it's ugly made one of my insurances tomorrow is astronomics yeah I'll try I'll try to get her to come through September who is it um okay Lindsay Jones and she's the academic of West Florida I think she restricted you've got some other information that you can get to us looks like you had some other papers there um these are just what I did is I took the uh the uh invoices that I've got any of the percentage of the increase but generosity .com everyone I say is that I only ask of dollar shorts may be possible that One-Stop shopping is not into our advantage we can do a quick question I think it's the other yeah you know the problem is if you leave there and [Music] [Music] right because they are interested [Music] very healthy anything else you'd like to add Jody or Orlando would you like to say anything uh make a comment on the insurance situation I have nothing to add this is Jody um clearly the insurance rates are going up I don't care what segment of business you're in and that's just the time we're in right now things are tough all over okay if there are no other comments promotion on that I'm not finished yet all right we're still under a general business so I'm uh did you have anything else by the way I just want to update we have the deadline for the RFP is going to be this Friday at 2 p.m I have committee myself a resource administrator and chair of the citizens advisory committee box again we're going to review them while incredibly and they're going to meet on Monday or see what comes in and you know you know for negotiation to council I did reach out to waste management and got a one-month proposal to extend dinner current contract rate plus the four percent CPI and keeping fee increase for which is minimal for October takes itself is currently our Contracting today in September but that'll take us through October you know it pretty much the same rate buys this time but if need be I'll bring that to the September council meeting for approval tonight Council all right cool all right uh that's it I spoke with Wendy Grimes today and the election Capital headquarters and and I just asked some general questions Patty correct me if I get these numbers wrong but whenever our election aligns with a large election we're roughly running 1376 dollars per election okay if our election falls on on cycle to where we put a few municipalities and they're really just doing it for us our elections are almost four thousand dollars so there's a substantial cost savings not only by aligning with the general and the midterm elections but also we would reduce the number of relations we have so uh rather than two every six years it would be two every eight years if we if we made this change so I wanted to give you that information to give you some more to think about also the next 11 the next election is March the 19th so we decided to move forward with this it would it would have to have the plan and the language turned into Pinellas County on December the 19th and so before I go around the room for opinions on this I wanted to give the opportunity to kind of speak his mind on what it would look like to move forward thank you Mr Mayor as far as what it would take to move forward we would do an ordinance that would stick call for the issue election with the resolution setting forth the ballot language to accompany that and so I would I would draft and prepare that I I have begun the process of one of the questions I was posed at the last Workshop was a meeting on or rather a memo on what you can and can't do in that process in terms of that we can see during the 2022 election year they changed what a city can pay money for or contribute towards in the ways of advocacy on issue elections substantially limiting it and so I'm trying to write that for you as well but as far from where I sit it's really just you know what are my monitoring orders where we left last time was there was a general consensus to move in this direction but people would sort of let it marinate and see if that changed in the interval as far as from where I said I believe I have I was waiting in part for this meeting but I believe I have general or rather the August to September meetings we would have a hearing in October Hearing in November and send it to them and send it to them without language for the December year December deadline but I'd want to have that process done cleanly in November that way if we needed to redo anything before the December 19th we also have the benefit of oops we got to fix this okay so I um I gave an assignment to the council to speak with us see what the general feel was of the public they thought it was a good idea a bad idea I I have had a few people say they didn't like the idea but it's the same people that don't like anything and so I realized that's going to happen and I have to you sometimes I have to I have to wait which what they're really thinking or if I even need to take their opinion into consideration everybody here that votes has an opinion and so I try to not for my own opinion about their overall what their motive was but I had personally I had a very good responses whenever I spoke to people around the community I spoke to probably 30 people and I had numerous emails and phone calls and whatever and I think they all like the idea but I wanted to see what everybody else what your feelings were if you were serious about this or if it's lost it's lost I think it made sense I did talk to several people that most people felt specifically aligning with the general election in the midterms absolutely made sense and so we were what we were talking about just a quick refresher moving from three years to four years aligning with the general and midterm elections production of council members from seven to five an increase in terms by one additional term and so what that would do is if you were newly elected you could serve up to 12 you were you would term out and then you would have to go back and take the year off now would be two years that you would not be required to take off and you could and to be clear to add Clarity to that what you're talking about is putting that to the voters that would go to the voters in terms of the charter referendum it's not if you're saying here that like I'm in favor of that being put into the voters it's not so much I am voting and this will happen correct and that is one of the one of the disinformation campaigns that's going on out there is that certain people think that we're dictating this and and that's not the case we're just giving the public the option to say yes they like this idea and they want to see you move forward the way that they are but so lastly vice mayor Shirley same answer as I did at the last one session on the paper moving forward and that a huge fan of the free time Mr Livingstone I'm in favor of moving forward and Mr Roberts he's not here Mr Baker um keeping the status quo I think 12 years in office fair enough all right well uh it was I was really hoping Mr Roberts would have been here too I mean Mr savior no wonder it's no it's 9 30. okay so uh yeah I would still like to hear Mrs Abel's comments but I guess we'll do that next time so the question is is do we want to move forward and uh and get started immediately with granting this up I will plan to draft it up okay good deal uh I don't have anything else last call call like I said a good question so what was the status of the fullest line and anybody I made an offer they accepted today thanks two to three weeks okay uh well if uh nothing else motion do I have a question all right all in favor"
