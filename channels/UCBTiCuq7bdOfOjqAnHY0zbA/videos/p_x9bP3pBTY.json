citizens Deputy CL for the record uh for the month of November um we had onethird of my code enforcement violations that were dealing with grass overgrowth uh which we have resolved a lot of those issues another third of it again is dealing with unpermitted remodels for any type of building uh the rest of it was mainly uh some houses that needed to be repainted which we have got clear those up um and then again some of the other issues were trailers and boats parked in yards or up in in driveways which those have all been completed um if you'll notice that this is a short report um last month or in uh last of October first of November I was off for two weeks we uh and Danny was going to stand in for me in case we had any problems um so that's my report and I'll stand for any questions Council I don't know if this would be on your agenda or even the city managers but I got uh Friday night and I think I brought it to your attention one time the junction boxes that they're doing for these underground lady under power um a lot of them Sixth Street I think seven Street might be closed but from First Street up to the caway they're about a foot foot out out above ground 6t square and there's no cover and you can there's at least a twoot drop in there yes so I don't know who would be be addressing that to that would be the contractor that's actually doing that type of work um I've never got any complaints or ask any questions about it but there's something we can somebody put cones in the six Street one yes there's um and I think also down on third they put cones around that one too they should be covered up okay we we we can uh we can address that with the contractor I do want to say it's been a pleasure working with you all in case you don't know I am being transfer actually my first day was uh working down in Readington North Readington Beach uh that's going to be my new assignment uh for the rest of this week and part of next week I'll have have the

move right over to the consent agenda which is items 9 and 10 uh this is for approval of the November 6 2023 city council meeting minutes and approval of the November 13th 2023 special city council meeting minutes do I have have a motion to approve motion to approve the consent agenda as written and proposed all right and do I have a second second all in favor I any oppos all right the consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 11 this is for consideration of resolution 20238 placed on the agenda by City attorney MOA Mr MOA would you please read this resolution thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2023-the and oversight committee providing for membership of the committee providing for the identification of the chairperson providing for duties and responsibilities of the committee providing for meetings of the committee and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of resolution 20238 by title only Mr Mayor in as much as I was asked to this is on the agenda as the um presented by me I was approached by the city manager and asked about the process for selecting the auditor for the coming year for those of you who have been serving for that amount of time you may recall a similar resolution from 2021 um establishing an audit committee and reviewing that in the statutory language it looked like there were some tweaks um that were necessary Chief among them the statute requires that while a council member does serve on that committee they must be the chair and that's not how it was previously structured um and a few other little things just to make this clear so this resolution um largely parrots the language you would find in the statute um this uh the the duties and responsibilities set forth in section three are divided into two categories to capture the process for selecting the auditor and then the continuing engaged role of this subcommittee which would be composed entirely of one of you and your cic this your citizens advisory Comm this was one of the contemplated functions of your citizens advisory committee so um you would you would come together in that context wearing that hat and then providing continuing oversight so that's the purpose of this resolution and happy to answer any questions you may have thank you Mr Mora before we take questions from the council I'm going to go to the citizens would any citizen like to comment on this proposed resolution see if there are no fers on that we'll bring it back to the council I'm need a motion to approve this resolution do I have a motion motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second give that one to vice mayor Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor I believe Mr Mo has explained it pretty well any other comments all right well let's uh take it to a vote Mr reer would you please call the rooll council member Frank Banker yes council member Mark Chester yes council member Leslie Noto yes council member Lloyd Roberts hi vice mayor Jody Shirley hi mayor D get all right so the resolution passes unanimously thank you mayor I do wish to add though not specifically on the agenda the resolution contemplates the appointment of a member to serve on the committee a member from this body to serve on the committee and chair that committee um recognizing some of you may not be with us uh come the New Year if you if you desire I think it be most helpful to make that appointment now um so that the the committee can begin its business but if not we can do that at a later meeting wish to inform the council as to how they wish to proceed question that can that be done in a work session too we typically don't take official acts at work sessions you're not going to see that in a statute but by the way this Body Works and its rules of procedure typically we do that we take official acts of meeting so we could I I don't know that a whole lot's going to happen between now in the January meeting if this board desire if the council desires to wait um but I did want to make sure uh you were aware of that auction I would propose that we nominate someone at this meeting tonight and I would like to nominate L than second thank you any others I would propose that we wait only because we're going to have a at least one additional possibly two additional MERS at the next meeting has some backgrounds that are very strong in are I am hopefully we'll have somebody in the accounting auditing skill sets that Council what do you think I stay with Mr Rober is that accept that's that's that's i i i defer to manager reer but that's certainly acceptable it's a legal course of action it's really up to you I I I don't know the administrative pressure so I defer to manage a refer in that regard so the U the audit committee the audit selection committee will need the meet just to approve the RFP before it goes out um given it's the holidays I don't know if they be able to get a meeting in December so if we do it in the January meeting and appoint the chair off of council is we fine and then meet and release it okay y that sounds like a good idea and uh we what I would recommend if if anyone changes their mind or they decide they uh they would like to be on this uh would like to be on this committee then um please contact the city manager and put your name in the Hat so all right now we will move on to item number 12 this is consideration of applicants to fill the vacant City Council seat uh which is uh to replace Belinda Livingstone uh we have two candidates uh we have one which is Kimberly Shaw Elliot and we have Michael award uh Kimberly Shaw is not here tonight she is actually attending or not attending but she is with a very close long-term friend uh with a serious surgery so she was unfortunately un aable to make it but there she's she's on Zoom oh is she here yes okay Miss yes I am here I was just able to unmute okay all right all right so um what I was uh going to do was Let each uh each uh s or I'm sorry um applicant introduce themselves to the council and let the council ask a few questions and uh we'll just take them in the order that they're they're printed out uh so we have you online and it sounds like we have a good uh Clear Connection uh Kimberly Shaw Elliot would you like to introduce yourself to the council well thank you very much Mr Mayor and I appreciate this opportunity uh very much and I'm honored to do so um I know many of you um so um I I'll give a little bit of an introduction to my background that you might not be aware of one is I hope I offer a unique set of ser of experiences here um professionally I spent most of my entire career in the financial services industry and what's unique about that is that I've done it as both an attorney and an other uh positions as an executive and financial services firms so hopefully I can give reasonable legal advice but come up with practical Solutions and understanding what that means to implement um that advice uh here of course we have the incredibly U good Services of Mr MOA um but in terms of this role hopefully I understand what it means when we uh enter into ordinances and have an idea of what the Practical implications of those are in those executive roles that I served in um I have been accountable for managing very large budgets I've been understand what it is to manage to a budget um I've engaged in strategic planning um and um uh uh being accountable for results from a Civic perspective I have uh been previously in a Planning Commission on the zoning board of appeals um I've been on a variety of different chable boards and um Boards of professional organizations personally I moved to uh Beller beach in 2015 which now seems like a significant period of time but um I I still feel every day like I'm on vacation when I'm living there so very pleased to be part of this community um I have had a lifelong love of the um of uh Florida uh we traveled here as a family when I was a kid every year for Christmas time so um here I am U the opposite now um in the north uh during this holiday season um I tell you a little bit about that is that my dog who is a good Florida girl um I took her outside this morning to the door she literally stuck her nose out turned around ran back in the house all the way upstairs and crawled in the bed so um the being the reverse Snowbird is not exactly the the wisest choice that I've made but um I hopefully you can appreciate why I'm here um I've had an acute interest in the environment and with our Beach Community I think we have a lot of pressures on us in this beautiful beautiful place that we live and that balance between how do we preserve that beauty and how do we protect our homes and how do we make a livable circumstance so um I'm I'm happy to be part of the challenges to try to figure out those Solutions as we look at our future I recently semi-retired and I'm actually considering full retirement probably in the near future so with that I'll have both the time and certainly the energy to um meet the challenges of this wonderful community so I have uh a great deal of appreciation for this opportunity I thank you for the opportunity to talk to you today and I welcome any questions that you might have thank you Miss OT Council any question questions from yeah hi Kim good to see you sorry not the best circumstances for you um I hope your friend's okay but I have a couple questions have you picked up a packet for qualifying for this upcoming election I have and the interesting thing about that is that I thought that this would be kind of a shortterm um appointment if it's successful uh but I did learn before I left that the the opening period is now so uh I completed that application and the uh petitions before I left and submitted them on Friday okay good perfect and are you currently serving on a committee am I correct in saying that I'm not sure yes um the forgive me I'm blanking on the name of it it's it's it's not the zoning board what what is the name Planning and Zoning is that what it is yes okay thank you I think that's all I have thank you any uh any other questions from the council no all right thank you Miss Elliot appreciate you taking time uh to be with us this evening uh next up is Michael Hayward uh Mr haward would you like to come up to the podium please thank you Mr Mayor and City Council Members I'm back so I was talk that if you believe in something I'm should give up so I'm period um I'm kind of sad Mr INF left I wanted to talk to him about it here he's actually my neighbor and like my next door neighbor he was there with me like growing up um he helped me out a lot and when I got my parents and for my um job at the state department and he helped me out when my mom was sick and he he doesn't know this I want to tell him that but he would tell my mom about working for the city and he did influence me a lot to take action be a part of something and to be inv so I want to thank him but he left anyway to um remind you guys um like my background um I grew up here I've lived in the city for over 30 years this is all I know I went away for college and for other jobs but I'm that um right now I don't have anything to keep me away from doing the city council job um for the foreseeable future at least all the way up until March when it expir so I'm very available um and in my background like like I went to school political science got a Masters Inn studies um so it's big passion of mine to be a part of something bigger than you and to get back and appreciate you all for having me thank you Mr Hayward do we have any questions Mr Hayward I'm sorry just to clarify you were saying something ends in March well the next election okay and I picked up my packet of paper so filling all that out what are you doing currently I work for a movie production company and I run movie productions in the area but right now there's none n going on so I understand right any other questions or comments all right thank you very much Mr Hayward uh before we continue I need to go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment about either of these candidates no all right citizen comments are now closed we going to need a motion from the council uh to continue uh with this U vacancy uh filling this v vacany a motion motion made by L Roberts do I have a second second my last lario Mr Roberts you have the floor yeah U once again I think we're we're blessed that we have two candidates that um there's no wrong answer here I think they're both exem qualified and more importantly I feel like they have their heart in wanting to work for our city so that's wonderful so um I'd like to Echo those comments but I'm going to go to on the question um we have one vote we have one vcy right now and another one coming up less than three weeks why don't we just put both these people um because if we did that tonight we would not have uh properly posted the second vac I I believe 206c of our Charter gives Council full Authority I presume the silence and looks in my direction um 2.06 certainly gives the council full Direction proceed as it Desires in filling vacancies the the vacancy advertised this evening or that is being heard this evening was specifically advertised to fill the one position uh if this Council feels that it may yield um yield additional candidates to fill and and for the sake of clarity both in the record and what we're talking about here you are presently filling the vacancy owing to um Miss livingstone's resignation in the inter since marketing this position it has been announced RIS any Thunder um that vice mayor Shirley will resign from her position effective in the next few weeks before the end of the New Year I'm understanding council member Banker's question to say well if she's if her resignation is forthcoming should we put both these visit people in those vacancies with different effective dates you would still have to decide tonight who fills this role so we can swear them in there is no other role to be sworn in tonight which is another procedural but complicating fact Factor um as to how you proceed ultimately it is your discretion as to how you proceed um I I I think both positions have good Merit which is we told people we noticed that we would be filling one position tonight not two and somebody may have said you know what I wasn't really comfortable at that time maybe now I am or otherwise and you may be able to get others but I understand council member Banker's position that we have two vacancies and two people how do we wish to proceed in this case the coun the the charter states that you folks vacancies I defer to you as to how you proceed it as your city your community my my only point is that we're not doing anything underhanded legal or whatever we have the right under 2062 fill we don't have we're advertis I'm in in the meantime I all you while you discuss or deliberate I'm also verbally stalling while I get to read the precise language of the charter um but I would tell you that um legal is not really as you said a concern here um interrupted I just don't you have two candidates you have three months before this election cycle is over um we have a vacancy coming up so it doesn't look like there's a favoritism or anything like that or friends and family are going to be pulled into the next you got two great jackets and I don't think we Viola the charter and all fact I my my motion is to follow the and so the language of the charter and either course I would submit follows the charter um the the language of the charter again for clarity the records is filling of vacancies a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council any person appointed by Council to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual election and and it continues um as to how we would proceed if there were less of you Etc um there is no statute specifically governing this because this is one of the like the remaining Home Road Powers we have um so this is a home rule decision in that sense how do we how do we proceed and again I tender it to you as a council as to how you proceed I did not anticipate the inquiry so my apologies but um that is um ultimately your your Jud I would suggest regardless that you decide how you're going to fill the first vacancy um regardless all right I have uh I've heard comments from council member Banker I'd like to hear comments from other council members before I get my comments yes Mr Roberts so we we currently have two candidates it sounds like both candidates have already filled out the um qualifying package for the election coming up in March which is a good thing however my real question is um Randy so somebody let's say we postponed it until the next meeting for the selection of the second opening and that person had not qualified for the election in March what what issue would that cause a great question thank you council member with the question and for the benefit of all the question is is it is it is it relevant at all how we fill this position relative to whether or not the person is qualified for the March 2023 record um election restated um no uh you're really specifically concerned with just the the Bridging the Gap if you will between whenever you make the appointment and the March election you need not have qualified um in some communities people are very adamant that they want anybody serving in an inter capacity to not be running in other situations people want to know there's the possibility of continuity and that's again a personal decision that each of you make is you weigh who who best to fill the position but there's not any direct relationship or requirement between whether or not somebody opts to run in March and whether they are suitable qualified Etc to serve between January and March other comments Mr Chester I'm I'm just a little slow to change what we already had planned I think Frank makes some good points but I came here tonight ready to vot this the way it was proposed okay um I would agree with what lesy said um there's still opportunity that even that we um qualified period is not over until the 8 um I I see that as a benefit that someone's taken the initiative to be interested in uh qualifying for the election because it is such a short period of time gives us kind of a view from from a voter standpoint to see what uh potential candidate might look like on on Council long long range um but on our agenda we have uh we came in tonight to vote for one person there's currently one seat open even though in the future there'll be a second one it's not open until the end of December and I think we should stay in course and then my comment is um vice mayor Shirley is not out the door until she's out the door um she may get a a voice in the middle of the night or something that makes her change her mind and realize just how much she loves this community so I'm not giving up on her yet um I uh would also uh I I know for a fact that there's several potential C Ates who were still weighing in on the whole do I have to do a full Financial disclosure report and uh I think that uh they because they're already considering running uh it would be uh it would be a shame not to give them the opportunity to F vice mayor should Le seat uh and at least know it's coming instead of having to uh kind of get blindsided by a hasty vote tonight so I would I would prefer that we hold off and uh and only handle one seat tonight uh Mr Banker I'll give you the last word I apologize for thinking outside the box all right uh so that being said uh we now need to decide on one candidate where are the ballots at wanted each SE all right before I actually before we actually vote I have to go through a few things I have some formal procedures here that I haven't follow but I'm still looking for my ballot all right it says the mayor has the duty to maintain firm control of the meeting consistent with provisions of the city Charter city code and Roberts Rules of Order mayor shall announce that the audience must refrain from an outward display of approval or disapproval of any applicant uh the mayor states that the seat being filled shall hold office until the next annual election in the city on March 19th 2024 mayor shall confirm with each applicant that they are a qualifying registered voter which I am about to do uh qualifying physical resident qualifying permanent resident and qualified by civil rights so let's take care of that one right now um is Miss Elliot still online yes I am okay great so I'm going to ask you each one of these questions here uh are you a qualified registered voter yes sir are you qualified physical resident yes sir are you a qualified permanent resident I are you a permanent res resident in B yes I yes I live there permanently okay and are you qualified by civil rights yes okay thank you very much all right now let's go to Mr Haywood uh if you would sir uh just stand up for us and uh and let's confirm this uh so are you a qualified registered voter yes right and are you uh qualified physical res yes yes sir right are you a qualified permanent resident yes sir and are you qualified by civil rights yes sir all right thank you very much uh let's see here uh we've already done our presentations uh and let's see here we asked questions so we've gotten past that and I believe here we go after the council has concluded it's inquiry of the applicants the floor shall be open the Republic which we've done uh the clerk Mr reefer was the timekeeper after the public addresses uh Council uh council members shall vote by paper ballots with results announced that an applicant has attained a majority of the votes of the council members voted the city manager shall announce the result results so uh so everyone find your ballots and let's vote only Pi one okay so council member Frank Banker selected Kimberly Shaw Elliot council member Mark Chester selected Kimberly Shaw Elliot council member Leslie Noto selected Kimberly Shaw Elliot council member Lloyd Roberts SEL Kimberly Shaw Elliot vice mayor Jody Shirley selected Kimberly Shaw Elliott and mayor Dave gtis selected Kimberly sea Elliot so that is six thank you Mr reefer uh and uh so that's U unanimous for Elliot I'd like to thank Mr Hayward for volunteering and I'd like to welcome uh Miss Elliott uh to the council uh normally we would call you forward to be sworn in I believe that has to be done in person is that correct um I think it' be best if we did given that there's no urgency and and for m a little bit of the pump in circumstance of being present for the moment as well um unless this commission unless the council feels otherwise I think okay thank you uh and Mr Hayward uh next month we're doing it again I'm sure so I will see you at that meeting also and congratulations uh Kim Shaw Elliot uh we look forward to working with you thank you very much I'm very honored to be part of this Council and looking forward to working with each and every one of you and hopefully you too Charlotte okay so now we have to do a motion to appoint the applicant who has receive at least four votes which I believe we' we've already established that but we have to do it formally so I need a motion to appoint Kimberly Shaw Elliot to the council motion made by Lesley mat do I have a second second I give that to Mark Chester uh we're going to have to take this to a vote so Mr reer would you please do a roll call council member Frank Banker yes council member Mark Chester yes

squaring [Applause] in just for the record did I get that right is that is that close enough okay and I would like to uh thank misso for the assist also all right now we are on to item number 13 this is to authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order for the replacement of the community meeting room carpet he says he doesn't like the color no he didn't say that just thought I'd throw that in there Mr re you have the floor thank you mayor yes this is to replace the carpet in this barrier room um this carpet's been here since the building was built so it's it's been use for about 13 plus years um many public meetings and uh wedding and other party rentals have happened here um it's just over time taking its its wear and tear as you can see starting to show um through fing and some state so um given the amount of uh meetings and rentals that we do in this room um we've been saving to replace the carpet uh each year in our budget and I found um a quality carpet that I've uh included the U quotation form which is off of a sourcewell quote which is also um a uh alternative uh alternate contract Source on the state's uh Department Management Services website um it is a buril carpet shade uh it has some tones of green but overall it's a gray um not so much of a defined pattern as what we have in here um but we when the staff looked through all the samples we thought that we wanted to catch the the green undertones um that this room has through its trim already and uh we feel that this will over time not show um stains as as they come from from the use so um like I said I I included the specifications and uh the sample I've also um laid out the sample and I I've emailed you guys picture so just to so you can see it in the room um but again I'm asking that um being this is uh piggy V or sorry quoted off a sourcewell contract um there was a an RFP done by sourcewell um that we move forward and approve this purchase and the amount is going to be for $ 32,423 and both the like I said the material and the labor are quoted off the source well so we satisfy our purchasing requirements and that's all I have thank you Mr reefer uh before we bring this to the councel we go to the citizens for comments on this on thisa item would anyone like to speak about the carpet all right citizen comments are now closed going to need a motion from the council would someone like to make a motion that we authorize city manager and executive P purchase order motion made by Leslie Mata do I have a second that second by Mr Roberts Mr ter you have the floor right any other questions or comments no all right uh because this is a large expenditure I'm going to ask that we do a roll call V just so that we're on record of spending some money okay council member Frank Banker yes council member Martin Chester yes council member Leslie Noto yes council member Lloyd Roberts I BL mayor jie Shirley I mayor Dave gtis I so it passes unanimously Mr reer you are authorized to proceed thank you sir all right we're up to item number 14 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business okay in that case we are now up to item number 15 which is city council comments this month we begin with council member Bank um 3 weeks from today we'll be celebrating the birth of Christ while his Earthly father sought C the night of his birth as The Story Goes I hope pray that all residents they have their own will this holiday season finally Merry Christmas to all City manag leave January thank you Mr Banker all right up next is council member Roberts thank you Mr Mayor you know I know there's been a lot of talk and discussion and wondering about the um Infamous form six that we we've been challenged to to deal with um something that's coming up I believe it's Wednesday the Florida League of cities has established a zoom meeting um and so I'm planning on definitely signing on to that and really my message is if there's um Mr Mayor mentioned that there were several people that he's aware of that may be considering I would highly recommend that if you're considering which I hope I would love to see like 25 people um fill out packets to run for our positions but if you're interested in in running and you have some question or you're concerned about the form six I would highly recommend I'm sure anybody can get on the far City's website and go ahead and sign up for that s that they're going to be presenting I would also assume it's going to be a question and answer type environment so we can all learn a little bit more about it I kind of get a gut feel that there's so much discussion going on about this particular issue and I kind of feel like a lot of us maybe I think the state is marketing this very well that they're causing scenarios and I can't walk in anybody else's shoes but I feel like they're causing uncomfortableness to anybody that's considering or is already in in positions that are going to requir to form six so please take the opportunity anybody that's interested in running for a position to learn everything you can about it and again it's this Wednesday and I think that would position everybody better to make a decision that they have more knowledge about and hopefully are more comfortable with and Merry Christmas to everybody out there who listening with the city to our Council and everybody in the audience thank you Mr Roberts up next is council member Chester yeah I would like to wish everybody a safe and happy holiday um to everyone out there in our little community and to my fellow council members here and our two paid Associates over there as well and uh I want to second one um Frank said um this is a great time to spend family uh but it's also a good time to remember why we celebrate what we are doing and it's the birth of Christ so thank you thank you Mr Chester um M Mata Merry Christmas holidays to all council members to all the residents of Beach all have a safe wonderful thank you vice mayor Shirley well I want to start by saying thank you all for the the two candidates we had for the open seat and I hope that you'll come uh back when we have more open seats because I foree that coming the near future um as I have uh resigned my position on um due to the form six requirements this new law that has been put into place um and you know it takes away some rights to privacy as us as council members yes we are elected officials but there are some things that you know between my husband and myself and not open to public and then my financial disclosure is one of those things that's just not open to the public so uh especially given some of the history of this city and some of the uh lawsuits that are still open it's a it's an uneasy feeling so I uh have chosen to resign although I appreciate everyone's um support and um have been blessed to be able to serve our community and hope to be able to um still help out with the city on in other areas where it will provide I won't have to provide that for exposure um I want to say thank you to everyone for um putting faith in need to to U support the city also just Merry Christmas I hope everyone has a blessed holiday season with their family and um get out and support our community whenever the opportunity is there thank you thank you vice mayor Shirley it's been an honor to work with you and uh I think you're still committed to a work session right that's right okay so I won't say my final goodbyes at least on the council until until then um I'd like to remind everyone here and at home that you are what makes belir Beach the Envy of pelis County despite the new rules that Tallahassee has thrust upon us we still need talented and trustworthy candidates with a love for their City uh for this upcoming election if you would like a seat on this Council please help us help us to keep b beach b beach and pick up a k a pack from Kyle a candidates packet and uh uh if you're if you're seriously thinking about it uh please uh as Mr Robert suggest look into the form six presentation that's Wednesday okay and I appreciate you bringing that up and uh uh other than that oh I will say this uh the way that I've calculated it right now we're either going to have five or three seats that need to be filled in the next election uh so that's it will be free if it doesn't uh if it if the uh we don't produce the council it'll be five that's a huge bill for for belir Beach because normally it's 4 and 3 but we're asking for five people right now so I just want to keep that in mind uh this is a wonderful community that we live in uh I think that we're all here because we love the city we love our neighbors and U I'm hoping that there's others that are willing to put themselves out there uh to serve this great community and help keep it what it is um other than that I'd like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year would anyone like to make a motion motion made by Frank Banger do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I any opposed all right good night everyone"
