indivisible liberty and justice Eddie would you please call it over council member Wesley notera here council member Lord Roberts president vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle richler City attorney Randy Moore president and city council member Belinda Livingston was unable to attend and council member Frank bankert is not present thank you Patty all right we'll just go ahead and get started with item one uh hopefully everyone will received the email that uh the the uh items had changed a little bit so we're going to move right on to review storm water Improvement project plans um he texted students outside so if you want to jump up to the proposed ballot measures first and the weakness to item number two uh uh okay give them time you think he's you think is him he said he was right outside just go to the back okay all right so item two uh this is discretion of proposed ballot measures and this was put on the agenda by city of man uh City Attorney Laura thank you Mr Mayor um in the past few months we've discussed proposed ballot measures I want to start by beginning for the clarity and the record this is a work session you are not voting on anything you are not changing anything in your Charter tonight um nor are you putting anything to the residents as of this evening um we would do that by an ordinance and a resolution in the case of each one of the four ballot measures that you have raised in previous work session discussions and so what I have presented to you this evening are four separate ordinances and resolutions their companion to each um and a fifth document that reflects what your Charter would look like willing you to move forward with these and if all four were approved by the voters these will all be put to the voters but if they were to be approved this is how the the document that begins on page two of the packet materials and says pages one of three two of three and three of three is what the charter would look like if you accepted if you and the voters accepted the changes in the form in which I have proposed them so um we can take them in succession uh as they've been uh written here and they would not be highlighted and in red text in the future again for purposes of a work session I just thought it easier to draw your eye to here's what's going on so the first one is uh specific to the term limits and while what I did there was change the language from two to three break up with a clause into independent clauses or sentences um and so that's really the first one the the first thing you discussed and the ballot language that's being proposed for that and by the way by Statute ballot language can't be more than 75 words um so you're not working with a lot there it's planning for what I'm trying to do here but um the valid question that is to be clear that the intention is to be clear to the voters is shout a city a member Charter to prohibit council members from serving more than three consecutive terms as opposed to the existing limitation prohibiting the council member from serving more than two consecutive terms yes to Amendment Charter provision no to retain the existing Charter position revision and so that is the the proposed language and you'll see that that's um the resolution that follows the ordinance um and they don't have numbers yet because it's working documents but um you can see that there so rather than take all four of them at once I find it's easiest to eat the elephant one bite at a time um so with that as we talk about the the first Charter Amendment that's proposed here it's the term limit one I wanted to see if there was any feedback concern about the way it's phrased how it works Etc were it to be approved by the voters you're saying we have the vowel language in here yes ma'am and res there's a resolution that is uh three pages long and uh that resolution follows um if I'm looking at a PDF I work from the digital side of it so um the resolution is two pages on the second page it says Charter amendment number one referendum increasing limit on consecutive terms um and then it's right in the middle of that page um next week uh actually I have some positive comments to make I thought it was uh pretty amazing how you put all this together uh when we first started discussing this I just kind of went out on my own and was trying to logically in my own mind and on paper try to figure out how we would actually get through this and then when I read what you put together I just thought it was very very about that thank you I appreciate that and I I do understand because the packet materials aren't separately paginated I can't point you to page 42 or 41 but it is the first resolution in the series The Resolution yep and then the ballot so the citizens would be voting on this one issue so all of you what will be voting one off there but after this one issue they would go there and when they went to The Ballot Box that's what they would see perfect Charter amendment number one reference so that's the title the title is limited to ten words right um it's a referendum increasingly non-consecutive terms and so that's clear what's happening and then the language says we're increasing it from three to two yes or no and the yes or no element is a required element of of a ballot referendum measure I think that's clear foreign so you know my request to you as we go through each of these four topics is one if you feel the ballot language is confusing for some reason let me know and two if you feel hey yeah that's what I want to change but that's not how I want it changed in the charter let me know so we can address that that's really where the rubber meets the road here most of the stuff that surrounds it that's not yellow and highlighted um is the existing language so I'm not really looking for too much oil required whereas Clauses and the like um but you know the really key thing is the how the charter is changing and the bowel language as we as we go through each of these it makes perfect sense to me yeah any questions I'm looking at above where it says charter number one special election shall be held on Tuesday March 19 2023. yep those would all be changed to 2024. thank you thank you that's one of those uh copy things and that's why we do this so I was really focused so much on the other things I promise and that probably you'll see that globally through each so I will just I'll make a point to note that okay everybody okay with that section yes yeah yeah that's all right let's move right all right so the second one [Music] um is specifically the change from Seven members to five members and that appears in a few places in your in your Charter and as it presently reads it appears in section 2.01 where it says there shall be a council of of seven I'm striking that to five in the election in terms presently I mean the dates are retroactive in the in in other things but I I've inserted language to say how it would be handled going forward and I'll explain that in a moment and then you are limited to a single subject when you do ballot measures but the the majority vote here is stated as an explicit number in your code is five members of the seven well if we if we go down to seven and we retain five and then it's going to take a unanimous mode every time you do something or four rather for a super majority sorry a super majority so um it's just rather than have a hard number that I just changed it to a majority of the council is required for official votes and so that's why the ballot language reads um two pages later on the resolution and again it does have that 2023 there but it does say Charter amendment number two reducing the city council to five members from Seven members shall the city council a normal Charter to provide for city council composed of five at large council members including the mayor as opposed to the existing language providing first city council composed of seven at large city council members including the mayor and address the corresponding voter requirements for the council to take action so it captures everything that's happening there and that's I don't have any problems with that one that's very clear also thank you Council so the one thing before before you throw to councilman I do want to explain how this is is working um of the seven members we presently have are 6.5 as we transition with members Abel's uh C each of your positions are coming up for election in 2024 and 2025. so what this says is beginning in 2025 so you'll be a council of seven if if this were approved by the voters you'd be a council of seven for obviously the remainder 2023 and the whole of 2024. in 2025 you have three seats coming up including the mayors so what instead of doing it that way um what it does is it says or it might be four trying to remember the math on it but I charted this um three instead of we would just have the mayor's seat come up and one of those other vacancies come up and then that drops off the other two I'm at that point and then from there on it would just be normal cycles for everybody now I I did have a question about that um and I guess the the council and then uh obviously the citizens would have to make the ultimate decision on it but um it sounds like every term uh for every time someone uh is elected they would serve with the council for three years you would have the same people for three years because uh I mean depending on how it works in terms of if they Grant the extent because one of the other ballot measures is a four-year change well I had a originally I was hoping that there would be some way to work to where our elections happened every two years and and it sounds to me like that's not going to be the case now we can certainly make it the case I rolled it out so that you were were going to be right now you're around a 2024 and 2025 interval the way this does read you're right that it would go to four-year terms and so it would be you know the next ones would be 2028 and 2029 if we were wanting to do a rolling basis I can do that and that's probably why I wanted to have this discussion for me it was clueless that way because you guys have at large Council seats that are both on this current thing on this current schedule the challenge for me in phrasing that as I looked at that is like okay well that is a long time for you know that council is because we're at large seats I couldn't say seat one will come up down in seat two or district one or District Two And so enabling that without your input was a little disconcerting on my end I wanted to set up well I can keep their current intervals and depending on what the voters accept and reject well obviously we'll inform what happens here but if you want and that's again why we're work stopping this if you want some kind of roll out that's different than that then I need that feedback so I can you know certainly your method that as proposed is the cleanest it's just is that what we is that how we want to do it number one yeah you guys are awesome uh one of the elections would not fall on a general uh the whenever a presidential election happens or the midterms you know one of the other I'm not sure you'd have an off election year what the alignment is but one year would we would have an expansive election and then one year we would have an inexpensive election um whereas if we piggyback on the midterms then they would both be inexpensive elections because those ballots go out to everyone it was under the impression we were trying to get on a four-year cycle that's correct with the presidential election not have I mean I know it's going to take a couple of Elections to get to that cycle but that was my impression what we're trying to achieve that's right in the way that it's written right now that would that would not happen if you got it on the presidential interval and you did that it would be to have the whole Council change over would have everybody align everybody's nose no that's not what I'm saying that's not what you're saying the mood terms right so you have presidential race that would be uh the 23 year that the mayor is elected and then you have the midterm elections which would be 2020 if the runway now would be 2024 and 2026 and correct 28. right now you do have an odd year which is off cycle the problem we brought into is how do you you have to short cycle or long cycle correct sitting council members to make that happen correct and that was I I certainly didn't want to be the one to propose that without explicit Direction in that regard well and that's why um you know I'm bringing this up is so that we can consider everything no not just making it I don't want it to be easy if it's wrong but at the same time if if everybody's good with the council not changing at all for three years and then you have two elections boom boom um yeah you know the the to the extent there's any Community to go this way the the count of railing narrative is you have the opportunity to get a stride with one another and and work you know that longer overlapping tenure to extend you're looking for why would we ever do it this one way that's the the one conventional is wisdom in that regard I'm not saying that's reason enough I'm not trying to persuade I'm just trying to give you all the information go ahead see this makes sense so we know that we're going to have an election in March of 2024. that's a given if we said in the language that Randy would do much better than I would that whoever those um three individuals are that are elected they would come up for re-election that they were still available to to run in November of 2028. which would be the general election would be 26. well not 26 because that's really quick because that's going to be I think the other group's going to fit into that cycle so again so if it's going to be a four-year term if it gets voted off so so here's here's part of the challenge and I think part of the reason why I made the document that starts the materials is as you conceptualize one it's naturally leading you to the discussion of the other but that's like right now we're talking about the seven to five and and how do we cycle those seven to five if we do a three year affiliate I was like well if I if I predicate this on the fact that all of these are going to be approved it's one result but I'm trying to write them with an understanding that one of one or all of them may not pass and if that is the case what result do you you don't want to write one that is holy or you could write one that is only contingent on the other if that's your intention and say this measure shall not take effect unless of the other one's also approved but that also was not the the approach here and so they are presently interrelated in a way that makes it difficult to discuss them in a vacuum but the way they are drafted for purposes of clarity ease and avoiding issues on the back end as they are drafted in a vacuum in a way but as you see harmonized ultimately in that single document but that way if one were to fail for example if I change seven to five and assume that the voters are going to approve for your terms and they don't and I've made my whole schedule based on four-year terms then in the charter then it doesn't make any sense later after it's been adopted and now we're having a charter amendment to fix a boo-boo of some sort um and so I wanted to make sure to avoid that kind of confusion it's almost uh it's almost like it'd be better to run two of them together but you can't do it I mean you can do single subject you can make one of them contingent on the effect this shall only take effect if battle measure seven shall only take effect if ballot manager 6 passes right you can do that um the challenge the only challenge I see there is if you're going to do that understand that if six falls out it's like oh we really did want a five-member council but we made a contingent on for your terms for example well then you get your five-member Council you lose your but then you end up with neither if you make them contingent on each other I don't think you can you came and I don't I mean because I think the 5 members are pretty important aspects whether we get the term changed or not so I would just clarify that when you're using can in that sentence I'm saying you have the capacity to do you have the capacity to whether or not your shirt is a perfect question it's the best idea I think the goal is to get this to five member Council number one would you all agree uh I would I would say so yes absolutely and then the other amendments are the other ballot items are um secondary um maybe to you but I think that I mean I think they're important equally is important but I don't I think the number one number one is the five council members because and we can also look at when we get to that fourth item of of when your election cycle is that would probably be the best place to address that if we want if there is a way to address it it might be best there um because that language is presently just a basically copy and paste from federal law um on what your election schedule would be so we can we can tweak that a little bit but if you're really saying I want the seven to five to be clean and just its own thing then I think I have my if that is your consensus and I'm not saying it is if it is your consensus I think we can move to the third one and then maybe see if coming at this in the third or fourth might not make more sense once we see that language okay okay so the next um one in your packet three of four is the um is for um the terms uh failure terms and so that comes up again in a few places um it's the you know the mayor's elected for a three-year term has its own language of course the election in terms language and then we schedule a notice of Elections language and so um you can see the language there highlighted in yellow I I won't read it to you and with all the strikethroughs and underlines the Battle of language that corresponds to that says shadow of the city a member Charter to provide that each individual term of office for City Council Members including the mayor shall be for four years as opposed to the existing three-year term beginning with the officials elected in 2024. so how that would work on Election night if you're running and you know we have our qualifying period in December um for whoever qualifies for those March 2024 seats they would depending on the results of that election and referendum they'd either be serving a three year or four year term they won't know until we know the results of that referendum vote but that would make that change go into effect sooner than later um the other way to do it was just to put it off to the 2025 cycle but um again based on the um attention and experience this Council sort of communicated on this issue I didn't think you wanted rolling it out a full two you know 2025 term but if you do we can change that I want to be very clear if you're like 20 21st too soon I don't like the unpredictability let me know I was I wrestled with a lot of this so I want to make sure that it captures what you want my uh my goal for this was to keep good council members in longer and number one uh to give each council member the opportunity to do more uh within the city and also uh with the communities around and the county because the longer you're in the the better relationship you establish uh with those various entities but also it wasn't just for that it was so we could line up with the presidential and midterm elections and and you can't do it without without having four-year terms uh so um I know that during the I think generally we don't have great turnout in our elections we did last time but that's not always the case uh often it's very low turnout but I think that if our elections wind up on the same ballot with the presidential election and the midterm elections we're going to have astronomical turnout compared to what we've always had in the past so that's why that was my goal was to make sure that we had the most voters and we had good candidates that will that could stick it out an extra year to get the job done and council members as you're looking at these things I do want to note and I think it was a function of a file saving over another right before transmission but the radius Clauses for the ordinance on increasing from three to four years are the ones from the five to seven member I would of course fix that not important for you folks right now but just letting you know I I see that I've made that note and I would fix those whereas Clauses to make sure they're they all correlate to the actual ordinance okay so let me ask you this if we um we have these four items well let's go ahead and let's let's talk about this one first uh would anyone like to comment on amendment number three I'm I'm just trying to run through my head our next election cycle and dates I mean maybe you can clarify that for me yeah so let me um I mean our next election is March 19 2024 I which is when these will hit the ballot correct these will be on the March 19 ballot everyone where are you two approve these by ordinance presuming you did these would all be on that schedule um I'm looking for there's an email that I that I'd put together um in sending some of this material to City staff that I do want to reference real quick so that I think will help clarify some of this so am I mistaken in saying that this election this the terms cannot take effect in 2024 if the election is in March of 2024. well it will be the same time they're voting on these ballots right you'd be voting for somebody the way it's written you'd be voting for them that night so they could validly run for the vacancy the vacancy is there it's just how long will their term be would not be known when they when they qualified which is the if done this way um it's not cleanest but again it was you could wait till the 2025 cycle alternatively shouldn't you see problems with that Patty do you see any I mean I'm you're the one that handles all this do you of course you tell people up front Okay yeah so if you get elected in the March 2024 election to city council you might have a three-year term or you might have a four-year term correct depending on whether this whether this Charter Amendment passes and and to be clear the seats that are coming up in 2024 are remembered Notaro member banker and member Livingston's livingstones uh seats and then we would also have um members able seat but they would be assuming a midterm see they wouldn't they would not be subject to that because the term for members able seat is not up until 2025. right I think that what I see is that let me make sure I've got this right okay so 24. do they just said for the rest of the term I'm not remembering they just sit for the remainder of the term Point okay you appointed and they said for the rest so please strike what I said about table I'm sorry I've got a few communities in my head and I misspoke I don't want to mislead there but at least you would have you would have three on the 2024 nateros bankers and livingstones are up on the 2024 election okay so if the three to four failed then they would be up for uh until March of 2027. if it passed and we were trying to align with uh uh the next one would be yeah if we align let me see now they don't let all the even years on November so we got 24 26 28 30 and 30. so it would be slightly more it would be almost four and a half years for that term if we align them with the presidential and correct if if those terms correct if that all if that other um ballot measure passes on the realigning the schedule they would get a slightly longer term slightly longer term all right and then then the question is is what would we do on the next election if we lined everything up how do we do the transition with the people that were elected whenever I was you I think we have a couple options I think Randy so I understand exactly what Dave is asking so that election would come up on March 25 normally now if we're changing this to try to get on the midterm and the general election which I think is huge I think it's and I really think that's going to pass I hope so then we could say those people that would normally have been elected on March of 25 now we're going to wait until 11 of 26 correct and then after that we would have everybody on the midterm in general from that point on yeah you look into Patty because Patty's got these dates down and she knows uh Brandon does not extends their original election tournament it does can you do that yeah we can do that I I believe we could do that um we'd want to make clear what we're doing we could put that language in the resolution right and say if this passes this is what we're going to do so I want to make sure that I'm conceptualizing this now yeah as as describe if you will so what you're proposing uh member Roberts is here's what the challenge is there and that I'm trying to harmonize you're sort of marrying the November election um referendum item with the terms of office correct one and I'm trying to write them in a way where they're not contingent on one another and so if we said any official elected in that seems to me like it would be better addressed in the presidential in the in the transition to the November language if I'm understanding it right I'm just trying to think through how to how best to do it mechanically um is so we're going to change I think if you're going to have an ordinance if you're going to have a budget measure I mean Budget sorry a ballot measure that changes the election cycle then we could say after the language about moving it any official explain what happens there I think would be better to explain it there than in this one right in the details of the resolution but as far as what appears on the ballot it would that you wouldn't have to give details you would just say we're increasing from three to four right I I would say that I might depending on how much language I have how many words I have to work with I'm I might add more detail if I can okay um but I don't know that it's absolutely critical um to say and and it's you don't explain the whole process because you can't in 75 words but you might say and marginally extending the term or something like that if if there's space um but as it relates to the one we're on right now which is I have a question yeah and I'm just I don't know I'm just thinking this through we have a primary election in March what year does that fall in 2024 I'm just trying to think this through not everything happens in November and that's why we that's why I think our city has these March elections too because we do have the presidential primary right that's the primary though that's not the people still come vote for is my point yeah well that's true I mean so I don't know why we're trying to push everything to November the reason was because we feel like more people vote at the general and the mid time in November as it is a primary a lot of people just say not only that but but it's also a way to absolutely there's a drop dead cut date of every two years we have an election instead of an off in one election we have it in March and another one we have it in November so everything would be balanced okay I don't know why we didn't do this whenever we this is what we're having to work with I knew it wouldn't be easy but I I don't see any other way to do this and I would tell you that you know in as much as you're trying to conceptualize this the document that started the materials on these different referenda the three-page document that shows the charter that was as much for my benefit as it was for yours right if I do all this does it all actually make sense once you clean it up and remove all the strikethroughs does this all work it presently works it can work another way um and that's why I want to make sure that you know we're conceptualizing it in in context now we could I think we could go by by shortening that day like we talked about so normally the second group would come up March of 25. Randy already said that so we could actually have that election instead of waiting to November of 26 we could have it of November of 24. which was shortening it by seven months um shortening that term normally we would come up for election of March of 25. we could put language in there that said well instead of adding seven months we're going to subtract seven months from the current term but but I think that involves you so you may not want to do that I don't think it's just about involving him I mean for sure but I think the other concern there is um you know abridging those terms I don't think solves the problems that of what you guys have been well it gets us on the every two years it gets you much closer that much sooner for sure that is one way to get there yes I mean you could do it anytime I was just trying to get the most voters that we could get you know right the biggest turnout we could get and um I don't I I don't I don't really see any other way in support of adding it rather than taking away from if it's if it's feasible to add right the months to it rather than taking it away from the city right that's why I was just proposing both ways I agree we'll look at it this way also what if uh if you if you're wanting to run and then you realize if you run you're going to have a short term for the first one then you got to do it all over again that's probably gonna [Music] convince you not to do it no I think what member Roberts is proposing is that in and it's hard because again we've got to talk about them in in a vacuum in a vacuum in 2025 member Gaddis membership member Roberts and member zaba's ordinary terms end and so what member Roberts was saying was well alternatively we can make budget language that states that those four terms would instead of end in March 2025 your turn all four of you would end in November 2024. and so and get you on cycle sooner shortening the term of the people sitting at the table presently that's what I think member Roberts was discussing about the other option would be November 26th so hold on though if you did that what where do you place the other half of the council where where does their election you could all be on the same oh you can't do it yeah everybody lost yeah you have a brand new council with no experience yeah so so therefore by definition November of 26 would make the most but we're adding seven months right yeah that first we know that going into it I think that first set of Elections is going to be unusual for lack of a better term two sets of Elections yeah right but yeah so I think we answered that question that we don't want everybody on the same exact cycle no so it would have to be November of 26th by adding seven months to the existing terms and the people that get elected in March also would have uh the ones that got elected that's right they would have addition though they would get an additional seven months yeah so the outgoing would have extra yeah in November of 28. yeah four and a half years yes exactly does that make sense Randy I think I think we nailed it still look for me one more time I'm sorry if we can I apologize so so basically if if the four year term passes and the Align with the general and midterm elections passes um existing uh I'm sorry March 19th whoever is elected at that time they would their uh term would go until that's March 24 now they would go four and roughly four and a half months to November of 2028. correct okay the next group of people that would be up for election would uh currently they would be slated to uh to either Exit or run again in March of 2025 correct for review so they would actually gain about a year and a half it's what would happen because then they would be November 2026. would actually happen during the midterm elections and the uh the the other council members would be on the presidential elections yes yeah so actually it's yeah a year and seven months yeah I follow that yeah now my question to you is if before your term fails but you move the elections can't do it to November you can move it in November but you can't do it balanced I agree with you and that's my question is if if you do it the voters are going to be voting on each one of these things separately right now we can make one contingent on the other but right now none of them are contingent on one another so we can say that this ordinance shall only take effect if I would say that this is just my opinion Council police uh speak up I would say that if the three to four does not pass then leave it alone then leave the election cycle alone yes is that the last one the resolution correct okay yeah because it's it it's of no value there's really there's not not a whole lot of value to it you're going to have one election that's gangbusters and a big turnout then you're gonna have another one that has almost nothing because people generally don't care I want to make sure I understand just so so should that be reciprocal or only the presidential what I would call the presidential election resolution should only or or should moving the election should only happen if we increase terms from three to four correct term years term years sorry 10 years from three to four if however the it's the other way around it doesn't matter doesn't matter yeah I guess what would happen is you'd have that happen all right let's just say we're we're doing the three year Cycles so you've got one election then you've got another election and then you take what is it two years off all right then it start the cycle starts all over again well the way the presidential elections fall and the midterm elections fall you would have one election the let's just pick on the mayor's race you're going to have a huge turnout one cycle and then the next time that comes around it's going to be an off cycle and you're going to have no turnout and so you in fact you never know what you're gonna get okay um so I'll definitely need to work um as I'm as I'm understanding it we would keep all the language as it reads in the in the proposed Charter amendments but just change the contingency element and oh and and we would have to change the the in the um in the four-year term one we would we would explain the realignment yes yeah okay I will admit your method was way easier but it it's it doesn't it it it's it's not the direction that I I totally get that and that's why I said it's like I didn't want to make it more convoluted and say like there's a really easy way to do this um and so I I unders I understand the competing um ease versus desired outcome one thing I can say is this Council has never just said let's take the easy route agreed um I think I have my direction as far as all four of these um sufficient to bring you ordinances on first reading next month um which would be in a couple weeks so first reading would be then we would only do the ordinances not the resolutions with the ballot language and then if those ordinances pass and this in the November meeting we would do the resolution you know contingent on the limits having passed and then and then it will still then be put to the voters in whatever form the ordinances and resolutions appear okay so you none of this is being you know done by Fiat it is where the you know well do the voters agree on you know what the council's proposed absolutely and just uh to go on a record uh I I am aware there's been some disinformation out there about the people should be able to decide what they want to do and that's exactly what we're trying to bring to the people is this what you would like to do or would you like to not change it at all and so that that's that's as far as this Council goes the rest of it is up to our voters and our citizens all right before we move on to the next uh agenda item would anyone like to make a final comment oh it's all right this all right now we are on uh discussion of oh did is our guest here yes okay you know do that plug into here [Music] he's going to run some gifs should he plug in here yeah yeah and then I can plug in after you know thank you okay all right so now we're on uh agenda item number 93 which is discussion of fire ordinance uh City attorney more thank you Mr Mayor um this item admittedly is lingered a little in the background but you'll remember in the spring the city was contacted by an advocacy group that expressed some concerns about uh your existing ordinances governing public Gatherings and permanent related there too we've had some back and forth I'd at a direct session presented you a fairly um robust ordinance as an attempt to harmonize our code with their concerns uh they provided a different draft and then after that we exchange rafts um I've been working collaboratively with this advocacy group to arrive at something that meets both parties needs and so in large part the ordinance you have before you is very much their draft I made some limited changes many of which are reflected in red text and they're in red text because I was sending it to them to say hey I've pretty much used what you gave but I made some changes on it by the way if you're seeing a blank page four of eight that's more just because there was a page break in there and when you add track changes all the pagination gets messed up um so it's not skipping anything you'll see it goes right from D to e and that that is deliberate you're not missing a bunch of texts um and that's in the handout right in front of you yeah um at your desk so what this does is it it establishes a policy with several tips if you will or acknowledgments to some of the Constitutional concerns that have been addressed before the Reason by the way that you have this handout in front of you following the materials last week or around Monday or Tuesday I had sent them here's my version with all your edits without my edits and on on Thursday after the materials have gone out they followed up and said here's my comments addressing your comments and so that's what you have before you is an exchange it's a public record but an exchange between myself and um their account so and hey here are some thoughts for example in their draft it just said um you know we won't require insurance if it violates the 14th Amendment I said well how does that help a city manager who's gonna have to call their attorney every time they need to know whether or not to do that so they've proposed some edits um to address some of my concerns looking at this from the city's operations generally speaking I am I am good with most of this commentary um I'd run I might Wordsmith a thing or two here or there but what you see before you I think is a draft that sufficiently addresses the concerns of the advocacy group while harmonizing it with constitutional law and the issue and you know the the ability to administer it I know Kyle's in the midst of this year and as much as I've shared it with him he's not localized yet any any concerns on how would I do this Randy I try to look at when I draft ordinances look at it with an eye towards the administrator who's going to be the poor sap task with administering it and and and so I wanted to make sure that Patty and that the language especially clear in that regard but uh if you have any concerns I know in the past the ordinance I provided was much longer we've we've we've certainly Abridged it while still addressing almost all of the same topics and you sent them uh you you sent the last correspondence is that correct um you know I'd send something Monday Tuesday which was this draft with red and then on Thursday or Friday I have a Thursday afternoon and Friday morning I can't remember right now they sent this draft that you have in front of you the blue where it says anywhere where you say a T2 or that's their personal uh making comments the red where it says rm1 Randy Mora that's me making comments um so you'll see the blueberry spot as the red or adjoins it to address the concern I'd raised I apologize I got a little confused on the back and forth it's confusing I apologize about that just want to make sure you have the full complement of information as the council Council any comments on this why are we catering to this I almost wrote the organization from Philadelphia I've found catering to wrote people from Philly serves me well generally remember bankers um I I I without investing your characterization I think that our ordinance as it existed was a problem but we never enforced it I believe we never asked for a permit right you're you're absolutely right that we didn't have the the investment mechanism but all the same it identified an issue in our books and I would not want to set Kyle up or failure in the position of saying hey we've never administered it so just leave it on the books and ignore it because they were going to test it and if not then somebody else would inadvertently test it when they go to follow its terms and so it needed to be updated and candidly um I've looked I in in updating when I looked at a survey of communities in larger communities where this has been done more recently and you're seeing a version of this in part to avoid whether it's Fire or the ACLU or just some general challenge the other you know in Florida we have the added benefit if you will in this landscape if there are criminal laws that address some of what had been raised in our language about blocking the streets and that so we could look to to state law if we really needed that but I think this is an opportunity um would I have written this exactly this way no I agree with you I am collaborating I wouldn't say as much as catering it was an opportunity to reach a better product and call any future challenge because and and I said that to them there was some language they gave me I said so you're telling me written that way you'd be totally fine if we did this they said no I said okay that's your language so maybe we should have that discussion now instead of have a lawsuit later my job is equal parts risk manager and if I can find a way to mitigate your risk I'll do it I appreciate yeah it's just um I know the organization up there I don't think they have the Moxie to do or anything but I like I said Lynn never required anybody for a permit in my knowledge I don't think and that was I was sponsor them you know when this first came up I will tell you uh I remember it because I was traveling with my son when I was like Hey we're going to be there Saturday with nine people and I was like nobody has said no um we have actually never ever done this and so can we make this an opportunity to reach a better product rather than make a point and I to their credit as an organization they said yes let's have that dialogue because they could have been much more you know cantankerous and confrontational they chose not to be they said okay we'll work with you if you'll work with us I think that's uh reflective of how the city does business and I tried to carry that forward and how we reach this product I think that uh that's not what they were expecting I think that they were expecting us to say get out yeah they expected the standard you don't fight City Hall this is City Hall's code so you know get lost since that's not you know that it's not a fight worth having because in its existing form it was already a problem had we been in a different posture you know with better language I would have said you know sure it's not perfect but we've never done it that way on its face it was going you could still get a vagueness challenge or some other thing and we would either have to seed the litigation or fight it and lose I I don't want to put him in a compromising situation either but yeah right I understand philosophically you might not be aligned with them and I respect that as well thank you all right any comments on this everybody's satisfied with uh what this has developed into I think it's a good good working paper it's good thank you thanks for all your hard work Leslie with that Frank all right Floyd I'm good at the risk of putting you on the spot Kyle was there anything that you know I know we can still continue the discussion but before we bring in for first reading anything that was a challenge from the city side of things other than those things that we flagged no okay I think it's still that this rarely ever comes up or anything right if anything I I look at this as a is a a good exercise between two seasoned attorneys yeah you know the one thing I will tell you and you know I had the um benefit of sitting through in Indian Rocks Beach last week they brought um Scott Dudley from the Florida League of cities to do a presentation on local voices United which is the lobbying and advocacy and sort of the home rule hero side of FLC advocacy and it's worth noting here especially that we say this has never been an issue in our community but the face of our communities the faces of our communities are changing drastically in some in ways that we can't control uh or have less control like our short-term rentals home-based businesses and some of those other changes may have Downstream effects that we don't have the ability to anticipate now that the way people are using their homes might lead to more Gatherings might lead to more advocacy you know if I decide to make my home be you know Florida advocacy headquarters I can do that and if Florida advocacy whatever that means decides to host a local event maybe that ends up flowing into this and so you know as we look at our the landscape of our communities changing it's worth saying yeah this hasn't been an issue but do we have the ability to get ahead of an issue instead of always being reactive any other comments on uh this item number three all right well why don't we go back to item number one review storm water Improvement project plans welcome back thank you well since our last meeting we've we've gotten some survey in and we have some updates to the plans we'll give out here and outs thank you sure thank you well I have to admit this is much easier than looking up there and trying to make this okay we've been looking for a bug going yeah okay okay the uh on the plants hold on one second uh before we get begin would you please give us your name in the company you're with yes I'm Larry foodie I'm with the Gemini engineering I'm the project engineer and uh with me tonight is Alex I am Alex devoki with Gemini engineering and Sciences welcome and um so what uh we did last time we had uh not all of our survey was complete uh last we met and uh the plans uh since then we've gotten our survey it's completed and uh we have our uh plans updated based upon that survey so that's what you have in front of you tonight and plus uh taking into account the comments and questions from our last meeting so we've Incorporated uh those comments uh to the plans and uh and I think the the changes uh on that is uh we are still waiting on some uh more videos uh for the for the pipes and so that's in progress and uh What uh we're also be looking at in in some of the documents uh we'll have comments on the conditions of the pipe so you'll have a report from us of what what we're seeing the Rubio and where we see the improvements and which is what the plans uh reflect what we've seen came from and we'll update those plans based upon the new videos we'll get in as we need when do you think those uh videos will be complete hoping to have them complete this week um it was the first week that we got the tide cycle right um okay continue okay uh so um the questions uh one of the questions was pavement we talked about that to cut the payment and on using uh but possibly on use on Gulf Boulevard and uh I've talked with the county and looking at what we can use on the back of that uh plans is a well eight and a half by eleven and what the pavement mix that was used on Gulf Boulevard is a type SP 12.5 and that's uh that's a DOT mixture and uh our uh plans as we have them uh today we're using that same mixture so we can use that the difference would be the thickness of the pavement instead of the uh of course much thicker or we're proposing to use a running Edge and also uh and the table the thing is you'll see uh the article that's the Gulf Boulevard design and then there's three other uh roadways at the county right legs when we board a project what what they look for in their groups and roadway section and we uh from the county specs on a residential right the difference between what what we have out uh existing versus that what the county is today's standard is is they recommend an inch and a half of asphalt so that's that's the biggest difference so you're going to go down an inch and a half or you're just going down an inch with the existing pavement thickness which is on there okay are you going to nail it down to an inch and a half or we're going to we're going to move it down to the edge which will be run top of the line yeah and then repave the one inch back I I don't follow you it sounds like you said we were moving to an inch and a half but then you're saying you're putting an inch down I'm sorry I meant what I wanted additions to illustrate was the economy standard for a light residential roadway is an inch and a half okay what we have is one inch existing and and we're replacing uh primarily because going to an inch and a half that one half inch difference it cause stun extra room particularly on the payment the raise of up a half inch so the the ad and more do you raise the base it just adds in a lot more difficulty in getting all that to match I see okay so did you say that the um what you're going to expect for the contractors is in fact the same uh grade as the county used on Gulf Boulevard yes okay and just another quick question when we did 12th and 13th we used we used a different brain which is fine I just wanted to if that's the case I have to get that okay yeah I don't have that project yeah what was spec on 12 and 13. I'm not sure I don't think they did we had a different engineering firm so let me ask you something if if we had we not had this discussion which grade would you have uh installed I had the 12.5 okay so you had it that way all along correct I I it's probably the same because it's coming out of the same plan yeah and unless you're doing the modification of the Stone all right please continue okay the uh if you rather than I guess go through each sheet by sheet if you like I can but pretty much from last time the uh the uh the work is primary leveling the resurfacing we added uh more detail almost upon the survey we got back in and the biggest change it's going to be on 22nd that would be on sheet c14 oh on the theater yeah oh we got it here yeah oh yeah that's that's right yeah foreign Manor I gotta do that no offset me here for me right there um [Music] but that's that's good so he said he was going to do that perfect yeah because even down here the county said they'd use this SP 9.5 yeah and so we're basically yeah okay well like I said just jumping ahead some of the big changes that we made into plan since last time uh we added in more detail on 22nd Street which is at that intersection uh we're replacing the curbs uh each of the four corners to make sure they're draining and off the street now 22nd and there's an existing pipe with the inlet that's uh clogged and uh which goes down to the uh illness to the South and that that would be cleaned out so that that intersection will be able to drink much better than what it is now Council any comments questions I I would like to just go back to the paving and not this is just a comment for residents I guess to understand that we can't change the thickness of this asphalt or the thickness of the limelock due to the fact that we've got Valley curves and driveways in place so you can't raise Elevate the existing Road elevation while we have because of all the other improvements around it and I know that was a question that was brought up can we add to the thickness of this and and no one clearly stated that earlier right I just want to make sure that on record that that's why you chose not to increase the thickness of the asphalt yeah and I think the really the the main question last time the thickness may have come up but it was actually the quality the type of asphalt we were using but it looks like we're getting the best yes that's that's my understanding then when we you know when we did that in order that we made sure that we were using that mix I do have a question with this intersection of Bayshore and 22nd you say that that Inlet uh the Water travels South to then another Inlet in the curb there what is that what is that exit I don't know if there's that through someone's yard okay and that's that line is clear out to the intercoastal yes this guy yeah okay seriously it's a stronger that is stronger yeah we're good thanks yeah I don't I don't see where the where the actual drain is at on this channel no it doesn't it just stops at the curve yeah the actual drain out to the intercoastal we don't have that on the plane okay uh just space wise and and we're just for my own knowledge where is it on this uh on it's obviously it's because it's just going straight through the yard it's an extension of the pipe between D and D yes okay yeah that's 20 seconds I think uh I guess I have a Eis figure oh that's right that's right okay all right I uh I do have a senior and that kind of shows it overall where it goes out I'm just trying to get to it but I can go ahead and finish with the plans I don't think it's that important I uh I just had to I had to think about what I was looking at here I can get that to call that graphic that shows that and then we can send that out to to each of the council yes and it's a straight line to the right from the that's exactly it it's out to the water all right what's next okay the um like I say today the biggest changes there we uh we did an inventory of the inlets and the condition of the in the tops what sheet am I looking at uh it's 23rd Street I think 23rd my hand must have hit that yep there it is okay C15 right the um I think are we able to do that uis thing oh it's not going to be okay we also have a uh what I wanted to show you we did an inventory of the inlets and Inlet tops into condition and we took uh photos of that and we replaced it on a GIS map but we're we can I guess it's and we're not hooked up to where the people we're looking uh watching and you could see that so we I can get that document out uh to the city manager and get that up to council as well all right thank you okay okay and I think uh as far as the plans go and making the comments and and updating that to the survey uh the uh the conditions uh of the tops we have from our estimate we got seven tops that were completely replacing the rest of them look and uh in good condition and the uh the pipes uh where we have the window uh there's locations where we need to sit on which we noted on the plants and uh once we get the new video on the render to pipe we have an idea of where we need to replace or slip line or what other uh improvements we need yeah so any questions or comments so when do we expect the bid documents the big documents uh the build documents I got the uh according to master from the city manager so we're filling in our information so we can have the big documents in a couple weeks great all right on this on the page you have pulled up you said uh uh biggest changes so you discussed 22nd and what what is it I'm looking at on 23rd or is that just where you landed that's just where I landed okay the the biggest changes were on on 22nd adding that information and and away from what we discussed last time was 9th Street and with the question came about a underground Vault or the possibility of using them well we're still looking at deathman and I've been kind of seeing how we can do that um [Music] challenge that we have is at that end uh of ninth where the inlets are and and that is uh underground utilities you know we got the sanitary sewer line we've got waterline and uh and then of course those inlets and what sort of uh retention vote came in there and designing these things have been doing these things for a long time to capture the volume it needs to be separated from the water table and it's still open you know because if it's full of water you don't have all the capacity that you would need and uh so how do you how you build that as a separate containment um under the payment uh you got to read about reloads you got trunks coming down in the big trucks so whatever you put it to have uh that is really multi-standard and which that standard as well counting school work on gradients so we got to make sure it covers that now if it's off the road and not in the roadway proper then it doesn't have that uh needing to be that that heavy duty but we're limited to what we can do between the edge of the road and the property line and looking when it's gone going to work and that makes it uh a really challenging uh opting for us to to look at one of the uh is liking what we will be uh Wastewater station what is we had a reservoir or a location say a pump inside one of the inlets and in just like in a Wastewater what went well you have uh sensors of when it gets up high enough that it'll turn on and start pumping water out and you can take it out to uh decree heading up to uh yeah that that gets it out and we do have a one of those check valves at the end of that pipe so it's not flowing back on us at least very easily that way and so I'm thinking that maybe in the times of high water you know still of an underground vault something that can pump the water out and get it up over to here on into the ditch and out because we're looking at wanting to get the water out when it's high and how fast as long as it goes down and comes down in a reasonable time that would be representatious then that it's still not an evaporation take care of it so that's that's the next stop the king so I gotta explore that and get what the possibility is yeah the challenge we have right now and uh Mr Banker can probably speak on this better than I can but uh basically the water is high enough to keep the check valve closed water is already crested over the sea wall it's now in the water starts receding and there's nowhere for the water that's in to go so you're at the mercy of the check valve opening back up before anything leaves exactly yeah yeah so and that's what I was thinking of things but it was we're already receding below the sea walls yeah but all of those neighborhoods back in this area right here were underwater they right they were flooded several hours longer than they should have been and that's the water that's trapped in correct okay and that's that's what I was thinking this wet well yeah was this was this area right here from Kyle um I know all of 9th Street it was it wasn't flooded over um Harbor here it was close um and it was flooded about halfway into the grass down there yeah okay because when the water came over the sea wall it just came down the street like the Dickens put on I talked to a company called TMI and had the supplies pumps and goodbye I've heard him I know they didn't change their accent but anyway [Music] um they've suggested like a six inch pup would pump out 1500 gallons a minute um right eight inch would do it that's 25 but yeah but now we're talking with the diesel backup and I don't know where you would store um prosthetics although we we had a pump station for sewer down at 7th Street yeah we don't we didn't have any use for remember we used to have Lynn would have to bring the pumps in you know the the uh they call them the honey Dippers just the back trucks trucks yeah okay you didn't have any of that because that pump station ever went down which it worked uh and that order was three feet in the Stream out here uh so it was going right into the sewer system um but a pump a six inch pump with a diesel generator which would require me and it's just going to cost around forty five thousand dollars and that would have a trigger switch like you said would go on it a certain interval right and how much how much help would that give you after the wheel went down the sea level and take it right out but when it's coming over the sea well I don't think anything it's not going to help at that point well you have to pump it over the seawall but you could uh place it in a one of the drain vents um you could you could actually funnel a pipe right into that drain vent but you still have this outer unit that would have to sit up your blood flood stage I guess right as long as the the storm surge was pushing the water from the intercoastal up over the sea wall well there's nothing to do that right and that only lasted about and receded quickly about a good hour but we haven't I mean the seawall receded but then yeah I can remember in the Stream the uh National Guard came down the streets here around five o'clock four o'clock that's the first time that you get a big truck down the street and then FEMA just came out yesterday yeah they hit everything um is there a way with those check valves to have some release or something some release mechanism that would well see that's they're still closed right that's okay well it's already there right so I'm like at least as it starts to recede it's not going to have this constant pressure fighting no when this check valves close like he said it's keeping the water from coming in but it's not letting the water go out either until it matches the height and it looks more pressured and what we're discussing is getting it out while the check valve is still closed yes right I don't know how you get it out right that's the problem you have to run a separate all right easement yeah and around a pipe yeah you'd have to run a safer eight inch pipe through the we could you could funnel it out here too could you use that ditch right a little how did how did the streets there like Jordan Street yeah North uh 12th and 13th they were underwater for a while on the on those Seawall side um the the intersection uh of hibiscus and um Ohio Anderson yeah industry didn't have any just in the street barely it was all the backflow of the tide it had nothing to do with the rainfall it was all the time no we didn't have much rain it was just a surge and um I think you told me it was only a five foot surge or something like that I got four and a half feet elevation above sea level the water got to which is really alarmed it was anywhere there was a check valve and the water was able to come in some from somewhere else once that water was in it was trapped until the check valve opened again and that's that's just nature it is what it is and he's taking pounds a week too so they're not exactly 100 watertight right right yeah yeah they leak slowly but at that point the whole water table's coming up in this infiltration yes but I think that that's that's another discussion as far as pumping goes because that's not necessarily something that you would have to I don't I don't believe it would be part of your project uh a pumping system water out is it just Ninth Street that was the was it ninth that was the biggest issue Frank or is it no they were all right it was bad all the way down they're very helpful sandbag rich on my street we walked down when it started to recede and you actually had the sea walls about a foot higher than a regular Seawall the cereals he just put in at the dock at seven Street yeah they're up about four is that because of the county code or you just did that it's a minimum of a one flood cap okay yeah but the other ones people were I know it's uh people if residents would put new sea walls in that would help I mean that because you go in front of your existing and elevated a little bit and so it would help you know because that's probably why we've you know just broke our seams let's let's let our guests continue so he can leave and then if we want to continue this conversation uh at the end of the agenda then we'll we'll pick it back up please continue all right the uh on the ends like you say the underground involved in the storage and how the handle right we we talked about that um uh some of the other uh issues we've got some examples of uh some of the turbulence and curves uh particularly the ones that are particularly High uh and I have I'll get that to Carl as well is uh some uh companies that manufacture uh these kind of Steel curbs that you can inserted so it kind of it in the height or the the problem of having the small animals and kids uh find themselves in it and particularly some of those that we saw and there's there's quite a bit of difference we in our uh in total of Ubuntu increments of all of those and in the conditions along with the photos so you'll be able to see that so we'll we'll get that document out to you talking about the drains yeah yeah and I think that's where we said we updated our costs and uh I think in uh University the total budget based upon another uh having to change just over 4.1 million I don't have the document here in front of me but we're pretty close to where we were just refining that the numbers there um any any more questions questions comments yes sir so I understand this correctly we're not going to be replacing any pipes unless the pipes are bound broadly through our video right correct and mostly we're going to be doing is just repaving these roads uh fixing some of the end of the tops replacing some things where that really need to be uh the uh as we get the video we see what repairs need to be made and we'll look at what what's necessary do we slip on it be uh repair it Google what the patch if there's a hole in the pipe to the next thing we'll specify that and uh my brother's new pipe uh there's a couple of places where we were placed in the pipe and timing uh but it's it's not very much uh probably two or three places the width of Jerome 24 28 feet and uh but I have a question did you um it's we've probably covered this last time but I don't know if we had a resolution on it uh the steel pipe that was bent uh yes a solution on that one we're going to replace that okay yeah and you're going to put a uh some sort of a box and say the connection yes and and that uh one of the discussions we've had in the problem that we have in a lot of places is right away and we can would have to access it from the water from a large [Music] [Music] with concrete or steel pipe so we can do that we can do that what's the span of a pipe like that [Music] um uh plastic pipe 20 years it's comparable to uh to uh CNP pipe and concrete is there anything with a longer life than 30 years 20 30 years well concrete's got the longest life because we don't want to have equipment out there or well the hardest thing about using Comfort is the weight right and with equivalent to them and the placement versus these strikes any backyard so we can use material that has like the corrugated plastic but it's it's more dense materialism so this is easier to replace yes it may not have quite the lifespan of concrete but if it it's close sailing in 30 years it's not that hard to replace right exactly is it a plastic neoprene plastic or the uh it's a hard plastic and uh I'm not going to get you to specs on that but it's uh it's been using the new things around the use of that material for your read away projects because the swimming is not compromise it should last forever I mean that's that's correct okay okay uh any final comments or questions I just wanted to add that the plans are pretty detailed it details every pipe and what's being done to it so if you have any questions I would say review every page okay I appreciate you coming out I think you're giving us this presentation I look forward to seeing those videos yeah and the other pictures and I uh I I believe you're gonna send some files to Kyle to distribute to us is that correct that's correct okay great great all right well thank you for your time and uh I look forward to the next presentation okay thank you thank you Larry right now we are up to item number four discretion of action summary this is placed on the agenda by city manager reefer takes away thank you mayor so this is uh just a real quick workup of sorry where we talked about when we were reviewing the Strategic plan and we thought that if we put a quick uh kind of like news release of of what occurred during a meeting you know out pretty much the next day to get something out there to the public so that they have the facts of you know how how things turned out after the meeting and um this is kind of something that we came up with and looking at what similar cities have done and you know it kind of just covers you know what what it was you know if it's an ordinance what it what the basic concept of that ordinance what it accomplished and then what you know if it passed and you know what the vote was um I just wanted to run this by you see if you had any additional information you think it would be helpful um to include but this is just kind of a mock-up of what we thought if I went on a website would I be able to click on you know you know what I'm saying like ordinance 2305 will take me right to that part of the segment or um right now we weren't planning on doing that we have to hyperlink everything um and that's what I'm saying yeah so you would have the agenda so if you wanted to refer I mean we could always put a note um or link it back to the agenda um because we were trying to come up with something that we could do like the next day in the morning and then be able to pop it up and send out um and then you know obviously if you wanted more detail on what happened in the in the meeting then you'd have to wait for the minutes to come out which are usually like a week if that so you would have uh the way that we have it now this would just be another item you could click on yeah action summary I like it okay so do we call it an action summary or do we call it meeting results or something yeah I looked at them I didn't know what it meant like I didn't I mean we started from another city so you could call whatever you want yeah I know I don't I just looked at it I'm like I don't really know what that means so these are the I mean it's everything we voted on yeah everything we took action on yeah that makes sense and then what would you do in a meeting like tonight where we're not voting on anything and we're we're having a general discussion are we taking action on anything or are we just having a discussion or would they even be a need to uh there's an action item on this during the work sessions you would obviously have the uh the meeting before that the public hearing uh that would be a good one to have but um do we need anything else I like that the action items too because it's straightforward um sometimes when you try to interpret a discussion then it can be you know depends could be misconstrued thought to one way when someone could hear it a different way I'll tell you what would be helpful would be uh to have a link on here like Mr Banker said that would take you to where you intended to place the uh minutes whenever they're whenever they're finally outdated I know it takes time no pressure you can do it the next day okay it would be ideal to click on each one that wouldn't be a lot of work no no no no I'm just saying I'm just saying this is the ring to where the minutes will be placed you know and oh yeah see the minutes or whatever or at the bottom just say minutes now available it's like you know whatever yeah or maybe whenever you first post this you don't have anything but whenever the minutes are finally added then you come back and Amanda link to the page right it'll take you to the minutes just something else that makes it easier for people to find what they're looking for uh and probably not a bad idea that whenever this does happen it appears on the home page and not buried you know in all of our other stuff yeah and I knew uh admin assistant uh Jennifer uh Walsh um she's pretty Savvy with some things and as she gets more in the swing of things she might be able to add you know some of her responsibilities congratulations you hired so much yes she started last night no you said there I know Leslie was here what the status was and he said yeah he made an offer she accepted she started nice so that's good that's great I didn't actually think somebody would follow through with that but nice job yeah we found a good one all right any other comments on this particular item all right so uh next is discretion of proposed switch gears in easement at Crossman Park City Manager riesler thank you this is uh part of phase two and the very top end of phase one um throughout phase one they've been installing the pedestals which consist of switch switch gear equipment and um so um Transformers and things like that and transition boxes connections and um throughout the process uh um underground Consultants of Florida uh how to request easements from different residents produce um diameter layout and in that process you know um we achieved it we got some movements and then some things we have to relocating but it all got worked out over time um so this is kind of like coming up to our property which is Crossman Park um where Duke is requesting to put two switch gear um and if you flip to the next page it gives you an idea of the dimensions and what it would look like um it you know it's kind of like it's part of the process and when you underground the equipment still has to go somewhere and we've been asking a lot of the residents um as we move down like to put in for other houses and things like that but um since this is being sitting property I ask that they you know gave us a layout of what they're requesting um because then they would give us a an official easement that we would approve okay and um I didn't I was okay with this design we have like a communication I think it's uh the frontier um this is an in-ground box there these things unfortunately camping ground they have to be outside um but the way it's laid out is kind of just tucked in right on the property line um it'll remove like one of the shrubs but I think it'll sort of stay out of the way so it's sort of like a utility Corridor of that of that Park but I didn't see any major problem with it that's the best place for it if we can keep it on our own property versus you know residences property and you know for the most part they if they have to get in there they'll get in there so whatever the equipment has to be worked on but we could we can put like some shrubs or whatever and park bench yeah whatever oh that's good yeah I don't have a problem with that everybody good with that well it was the button right through these agenda items uh let's see here Civic website I tell you what uh it's five minutes till seven let's take a few minute break uh everyone and then we'll come back in about five minutes everybody will see better tonight I just did a quick glance on there so the reinforced concrete pipe of course it depends on who you're asking what what organization 100 years also 100 years okay I disagree why well first of all concrete group back then wait a minute we only have a 16 percent it was only good for 60 75 years always looking so Random foreign [Music] it's sold by Flowers Bakery owns it now they bought it they're flower spoons they're one of my biggest customers do you eat it I do good I can only eat gluten-free they don't make gluten free I found a smile on mine like a file that's good [Laughter] all right uh let's uh get this show back on the road all right we are up to item number six on a discussion of Civic plus website design and hosting solution proposal a city manager reefler take it away hey thank you so Civic plus um I tracked down who worked with town of Bel Air because I was sort of a website that we agreed was a well put together website and I got put in touch with uh sales obviously with a Civics Civic plus and uh they looked at the town of Bel Air website with me on like a web meeting and a bunch of other cities have similar websites and it gives up a couple you know I mean five pages in and you start seeing like premium design ultimate designs um that's their two main layouts now time whatever um as you can kind of recognize uh has a similar design where it's got an image it's got like the name tabs um and it has some different pop-ups depending on how they uh designed that um the difference between the premium design and the ultimate design is they look the same when you first click on the page but with the ultimate design it allows you to add more as a scroll um below that main image and you know um hot buttons so I'm not sure uh what we feel the greatest um the greatest values of like the town of Bel-Air website is because I feel um unless there was something specific that we wanted to have to scroll down that home page that we really could design it like on the premium so you'd be like you just would see this front page you'd have your crabs down at the bottom you might have some like some widgets on the side whether it's calendar meetings or whatever and um you know that would be it like there wouldn't you wouldn't have a Scrolls people feel differently about schools sometimes people go to a page and they're not familiar with websites they don't even notice Scrolls so then you know you have to almost explain too how to get to it um but really got to bring that up is because between the premium design and the ultimate design um the pricing that you see on the front page of this uh packet material um that is the premium design so the ultimate design to have that ability to scroll on that home page would be roughly about a thousand dollars more and what you're looking at is your first investment um that includes the um kind of like the design transition from your current web page to their system um and then it's a reoccurring annual fee so the premium design you're looking at right now that's priced at um about 3 500 an annual service actually includes all the uh you know programming and assistance um in the web hosting and all that um to put that in perspective the last time we did a website design was digital eel which is in St Pete Beach that costs us 6 200 for the design but they're web hosting after that we only paid we paid 263 dollars a year so it's a much lower yearly cost um well again we I think we sort of see what we're getting um they set up a they set up the design on WordPress and then from there it's just kind of we're changing things out we try to work with some different ideas with the widgets um which they'll charge us an hourly rate for when they do that but um it just doesn't like I don't feel like we really get the support to keep a well-functioning website um as much as you would with using Civic plus okay um because they just they have a lot more things just built into their program that you put the websites together with um that just kind of make it all fit together well um but a lot of this Relentless to my um because this current budget here we still have money where we could do we could start the process and pay our initial tournament but um price of 3 200 and uh we'd be good in building into the Budget moving forward and my suggestion would be um we would put together sort of a design team and um I think I would have like a couple staff members and maybe a council member just uh tag in and be a part of it okay uh I'm gonna speak for vice mayor Shirley because she normally wants to see all the numbers for comparison you know old versus new so you want yes so repeat about six thousand for that uh that design and we're doing all of the uh basically we're just adding new pages whenever whenever something happens but we're paying 263 dollars a year for the web hosting yeah or the web host oh it's relatively cheap now that we have it but again we're not talking about it right and with this new company uh the initial term is 42.65 yeah and that includes the the initial design exactly yes that includes in all the migration of all the because that's a lot of the work is is moving all that down through and building this site all right and then annual recurring services so for two years we get uh I mean I'm sorry for roughly thirty six hundred dollars we get two years is that correct no that would be three years locked in for two years that's per year so thirty five hundred dollars okay what does the council thing um yeah go ahead Mr Roberts uh when you when you talk to you know already the existing company did you get a feel that this annual recurring service for 3 500 is it equal to or greater than what we're currently receiving from company a that we have I would say it's gonna be it's greater than because Civic Plus they really when they do upgrades or they put together like the the back end of what you use to design the page they put a lot of effort into like making a like user friendly and okay um was like they selected to use the program WordPress um and they will for a fee if you want to try to do something more they'll work with the programming side of it to try and add a like a third-party widget or something like that okay um but it's not always successful and it's done it's kind of like they they're almost there to sort of use that tool and try and help you use it but it seems awfully limited and um a lot of times when we try something new or whether we're putting that scrolling thing on the whole front page there was like they run into the little like quirks with the system and they get you got to figure them out and it's just kind of okay it's okay maybe the difference of you know using like giving Windows as your operating system or trying to use like a free shareware operating system where you it's cheaper but you expect to have like the quirks to go along with it there's a there's an awful lot of uh of research involved in using an open source uh hosting solution such as WordPress and Joomla something like that um well if you never know where the plugins actually come from so the extensions that you want to add to it none of them are made by WordPress they're made by companies all over the world and you could very well be putting something on your website that's China or Russia or something like that um either way you have to kind of look around and guess is this going to work or not then you physically install it on the website and see if it's useful and if it's not then you kick it off and you try something else there's a lot a lot of work involved in doing that it can be done if you have the Manpower and you've got somebody that's that's focused on doing that what I see the advantage with this company is that this is all they do they focus on these uh Municipal these municipalities and uh looks like they've they've got something that seems to be working out it's not a one-size-fits all because they do some customization but for the most part they know what we would be looking for and so there's a lot of value to that the question is is it worth the I'm guessing we're probably if it's thirty five hundred dollars a year you know versus the 260 263. uh I have no problem communicating you know wanting to do better for our community question is is is is this what our community would want us to spend our money on do we have a some kind of a tally to how many people look at our website a month a week can we tell that is there what I'm saying I'm looking at what we currently have on there on as far as counting yeah um they I know they spend a lot of focus on that we're in finding out what uh most people most traffic is interested in and they then they design and have things like adjust accordingly so this is like a little bit of like AI built into it um but I don't have the exact numbers um I I do it all the time though it's very hard for anyone to find WordPress will give you all that data okay that's that's not really uh the issue if it's lame people are going to go and look at it a couple of times they may want to go and look at meeting minutes or a link to municip code if they are building something um it looks to me like this is trying to figure out a way to encourage people to come and look around plus it looks like this also adds a sense of Pride to your community if you've got a nice website representing you um another thing they told me is that out of the photos um that you find in these example communities they were taken by people's cell phones they have like Photo competitions and that's how they get the material I said it's actually pictures and then is this an actual app or is this just what it looks like whenever you pull it up on the cell phone um it looks relatively the same I think it's what you see on your cell phones and so and it's a very user friendly their opening page you know has keep me informed emergency alerts report a concern you know just things you can do right on their homepage right it's so easy you know and then if you want to get into the weeds and looking at departments you can do that but they have a lot of good information right on their home page and it's real user friendly and you say it includes training also uh uh 150 Pages migration free virtual training sessions and premium designs for me I think um ever since I've gotten on Council there's always been this uh feedback that we're not communicating with residents and I and I think our website has a lot of good information on it but I have to tell you I struggle finding that information many times um I am in total support of moving forward with um with this contract I've been doing web design on some companies I own and this is a very reasonable initial cost to set up um doing the web hosting and supporting I don't think that's unreasonable if you look at it it's 300 a month it's not that bad um I know what I pay GoDaddy for my uh work I'm having done or not necessarily they're not doing the work but they host the website and there's a fee to that so whoever is hosting it it takes there's a cost to it um you know we're paying 263 annually and it looks like we're paying 263. it looks like we're getting nothing for that service they're basically just keeping the website alive yes that's it which is why I think we have so many complications finding things on the site even when you do a search for a word it doesn't generate what you're looking for one thing we find too is things work um like our calendar worked one way and then they do an upgrade and it completely changes how that counter which it works they can't really explain what changed and right can we go back to the old one we can't yeah yeah that's kind of like why uh yeah meetings running uh showing like six hours because otherwise it'll fall off because people never had a problem with the meetings before once they started I mean just little things that you're like you can't find a fix for that yeah I mean I think this is just a you know it's a cost of doing business and it's expectation that we communicate with our residents and this is the best way to communicate with our residents we agree Okay so make sure that I understand what I'm looking at here because I see a quote here and then I see project cost here is this what they this is what they openly give out and then they're offering us a deal [Music] all right yep I see that now uh so we're a Civic Plus customer yes okay and that includes hosting well this is nice because there are added options where you can add you can do your bibs and our piece through here I mean it could potentially eliminate a lot of work for you too of course speeches yeah and looking at what he's looking at we don't have I don't have those pages in mind page 18. there's a good packet it's 18. okay I'm sorry yeah I don't listen I don't I don't let Patty print them out for me normally I use my computer my battery was dead I'm dead dead so I had to print both sides foreign instead of uh Mr Roberts what do you think I would definitely be in favor of it all right Leslie favor right I'd have to know how many people visit our site before I can make a decision on it since it's selling 50 25 people a month I think it's a waste of money if it's a part of that could be that they've tried to and then said there's no damage I think our site's pretty easy but not to navigate right now what are you looking for in our site well it depends on the you know is it easy to get from A to B or is it easy to find the information you're looking for that's what I'm saying yeah I had to with our site right now I've eventually found what I was looking for it just took a while sometimes well I think this will do too I mean until you understand me it's what I'm saying um I'm hoping it would be better sounds like when I'm listening to Kyle talk that he feels like we'll be able to find information in design and what the ability to do is gonna is going to in a way find out what people care about and then make that easy for them to find some holes would be that more people rely on our website but I'm saying if there's a couple hundred people a month looking at our site then it's well worth it that's about a question like uh like when we did the enhanced videos they asked how many people it was like four United visit our site on an average so we spent a thousand dollars a person and I don't think you know I was going to get our money soon I bet that you'll be surprised at how many hits our website gets good now I I can't say I hope you're right I can't say no no I'm in now I I'm hope you're right here's what I'm saying oh there it goes but I can't tell you and um but um the WordPress if it's working properly was going to be political headphones all the pages what's important that's a good question uh do we have a time frame on making a commitment obviously the next meeting right I was just trying to get this paid on this year if we what's that I was gonna get paid out of this year's budget because we had the room but um it's not anything that actually you know price point wise that needs um you know like a special approval I just wanted well I'll tell you what I would be willing to do is comparing what we've we've actually we would be committing to the first year and then the annual recurring services to get this price are we committing the three years or or are we committing to one year and then eventually we'll come up for renewal if we're committing to two years it says annual reoccurring services for two years and then then it says two years in parentheses so I take that as they want a two-year commitment well that would be three years because the first year is included on the initial term I think it's the initial term and then um annual reoccurring service year two we don't have a number yet for year three it's two years Commitment if that's what I mean I we we haven't seen the uh the contract automatic one-year renewal term unless 60 days notice provided prior to Renewal date and so that's at the end just yeah I think they're just showing us on this um estimate that the SEC the annual recurring Services which would begin in year two is thirty five hundred right I would just like to know if there's an out after the first year uh because I would like to see the thing in action and um get started with that comment what happens if we want to get out do we still keep that page yeah who owns the website you would you they would own this this is all provide here everything they've got this is we're renting this service thank you I didn't know that yeah and so what you would do is you would have to go back to what you had before and I'm I'm sure you can get a backup as you're terminating our services with the company we're with now yeah I think that I I'll find out about that I think they have a responsibility to at least provide us with our content I I suspect that once we move forward and we see what all uh what all we can do with this that we'll probably want to keep it but um it is hard pill to swallow it's a lot of money compared to what we've been doing but everybody's complained not enough information we've all committed to uh communicating better with the community and uh I'm okay with this foreign yeah I'm I'm in favor of moving forward so yeah I'll get the information I'll send it out okay I was like kind of like okay here's what we're looking for all right and then um so as from what I'm gathering like everybody's pretty much in favor but we'll get we'll get the okay I think the win Frank over once he sees the uh I'm just saying is it well is it well worth it yeah well if you've got no offense to anybody involved with our current website but if you've got uh Chevette and then you've got a Cadillac you know it's uh it it's not a fair comparison everyone's going to gravitate towards the Cadillac and that's what I'm hoping is going to happen everybody's going to want to actually use our website because I think it's going to bring a sense of Pride to our community to have a nice showing online instead of what we currently have which is kind of an and a novice approach and I'm trying to be as well it's old right so it doesn't have um new technology applied to correct correct yeah okay well I think the general consensus is yeah move forward again uh and but we would like to see uh once once you have all the details please email it to us okay okay item six uh discuss discussion of the sandbag filling attachment for tractor Mr reflorded okay thank you so this came up um after the last event and we were kind of thinking about a hurricaneian as well um but uh it was another uh let's see Monday during the when the event uh before uh The Dahlia came uh it was an 11 hour day of sandbagging for the for the staff and that was um them and some volunteers from the community that were helping out but um over that time they did a little over 2 000 sandbags um and this you know kind of after that the the work is is tough um because it's just a whole day's worth of uh and not only being out in the heat but you know doing the shoveling and all the sand and and we just uh we couldn't have done as many bags without Volunteers in the community but at the same time it really does well um on the Public Works staff out um when they're doing that many samarites over that period of time so this is an idea of yeah the job is still going to be hot and sweaty and you know people are going to be agitated just from the events happening but we felt that um this sandbag attachment in using the machine that we already have um and it can do 20 bags at a time is a good way to save um save the the employees backs let's say you know to to continue storm preparation the next day because it's really it's not so much the first day but it's that next they wouldn't have to come back in early to keep going or whatever we had to lock down and everything with the way the storms moving so fast but you can just see it and top on around like you know so this this uh this invention is actually like a social Source um patented invention that Steve Oldsmar purchased uh it was about five or six years ago and they're extremely happy with what they have and they're looking to purchase another one and uh they they did a demo for our community services administrator uh last week and um as you can see like the you know the in an eight hour period using this sm20 which is you know it's a skid steering password and that's the attachment we have on our our tractor um their average is 4 800 bags over an eight hour period so the idea would be um just to enhance uh how fast we can make these sandbags when we have an event come um and also you know less wear and tear and everybody involved and I also feel like we could still have piles to say like I still have other options to fill the bags if people want to fill their own but at the same time we can add a whole nother 20-minute pass and maybe down at the end of this cul-de-sac where you're working with a tractor and you're and you're dropping 20 bags at a time um coordinating you know people loading their cars and they tie them to go and I think uh you know for the price point of this um as you can see it's uh with the bags you're getting four thousand sandbags you get about twelve hundred dollars all right sorry twelve thousand dollars but um just wanted it to be considered um maybe uh hear your input because we do have some some funds available in public works a trading budget that would be this would be a Capital Equipment but it would be within our budget to to make a budget amendment and get a sandbag loading in this area in this year's budget yeah be used this fits on our existing tractor or whatever you want to call it yes so I have a I have a question um we we had a limit of sandbags and did they actually stop any water I think they did faces where where they were placed around where they actually keeping liquid from going I'm I'm not discounting sandbag no what I'm discounting is the amount of sandbags that we distribute and it wasn't Ashley enough no no not 20. yeah it should have been like 40. well well I think part of the problem is education about how you properly stack a sandbag to stump water and and that's what I saw was people were just slopping sandbags around and I didn't think that they were doing anything anyway and so I I would say that I would be willing to do this but we definitely would need to raise our limit I I would I mean if that thing did what we expected they should have been driving cars up reloading reloading all day long getting ready and stacking sandbags to stop the water and uh I unfortunately I think that some of the people that did receive water damage um if they're if their sandbags have been stacked correctly it would have stopped it um but I think that's something we give again back to the website I know the county actually has information on that about how to properly use sandbags and of course you don't just use Sam actually have to have some type of visqueen plastic behind it otherwise you're just smoking in the wind there right so we and maybe that's something we could put on our website that says you could be out there with the crew and showing like a little demo here's how you do this because you're exactly right if they don't do it properly it's a waste of time yeah well it's uh definitely they need more than 20. hello I mean yeah this this was nothing and people flooded so uh um I have a question are these poly bags they have coated on here are they proprietary to this this they are proprietary um but they are not much more 37 cents or something yeah and you know we talked to City Oldsmar about that and they said the other prices have remain the same um for these bags and you know this doesn't tie up right now it's just a little confused at what I'm seeing here I wonder how you attach into the uh Imagine This you know what I'm saying so they yeah they they have an array of slipping around those little holes um and then like this the ring is it's like a loop it's inserted so that when they release the bags they drop someone pulls them tight um and then it's set down you can release the ties and then the idea would be you know that's something um somebody who may not be as physically fit can can tie their bags and then we can help them get them in the college it does say here that it fills transports and securely closes and places the sandbags yeah so it does that was going to be one of the questions I was going to have though I mean I noticed when people were filling them out here on their own some people weren't as quite as smart like me I would feel that thing all the way up because I wanted more space to be covered that's pretty heavy you know when it's full other people were feeling them like halfway that's that's about I wonder when uh when Aaron went over there did they did you actually see the bat were they how much did each bag two-thirds film a fill yeah but how much did those bad boys weigh that looks like 40 pounds this looks pretty heavy I was gonna say exactly that's a pipeline bag and if you see yeah or if you see any guys in there they're using pipeline okay so you're you're from higher than what you would that's for support and those guys are bigger than me yeah but what I'm saying that's for support that's not for stopping here it is I don't know if everybody can see that yeah okay there we go I mean if we're going to continue to fill bags I think this is a this is the right thing to do you want to hear Mr Mayor one resident suggested sure bringing uh prisoners that's the last thing [Laughter] yeah it's it's one of those Acquisitions that you say well we've paid this much money and that we don't have a storm for seven years and people go why did you buy that but when you need it you need it it's called insurance if you don't have it you're gonna need it right uh so I thank God you don't have a son one year in my five that we didn't activate the sandbag station okay it seems like there's always something minutes it's like paying your friend Insurance you're screaming yeah what do you think vice mayor Shirley I think um we should move forward with the purchase okay just make sure that we have plenty of inventory of the bags because you know when you need them it's gonna be type you know it's gonna be tough to get them I I don't think 4 000 is enough no we can up that I think you need to I can get 6000 for the same shipping I could but I could even go size 12. I would like uh some sort of uh uh how many per home what what what where are you gonna how many homes are you gonna uh protect with this and how many bags do they get because I would like to see I would I would like anyone to have the option of having at least 40 back yeah and that makes sense I think that we still should phase them with probably you know because you don't want everybody coming up and getting all the sand right away but like it maybe you give them 20 and then they come back around and get the other 20 exactly you know um because I think in every one of these situations is just depending how bad um you know that storm is it's it's kind of like we're going to be putting sandbags until we can't do it anymore we gotta start packing up right and I think I said this before and again if you look on the County website they will tell you do not put sandbags in front of your garage doors it's a waste of time and it's not important you're trying to prevent water from getting in your house so forget about your garage doors because that takes a lot of bags put your sandbags on your access right whatever that door is that's inside your garage go in your kitchen that's this wide you put four or five bags there I'm stack them as high as you want to yeah but I've seen many homes around here that have a many of their bags or in front of the garage makes no sense I kept the water out yeah yeah see if it comes into your garage you only have a uh drywall barrier between inside and in between in your garage and inside so I would I would sandbag my garage too well you should have a minimum of like a four or five inch step in right yeah but you know we're thinking that the mercies are only three inches two to three inches mine's mine is about like that yeah yeah but it's still the garage door um you know on the sides it's going to get in typically it's just it's more difficult and my garage is the experts say do that don't don't waste your time that's my front door I've got a tarp and a vapor barrier under it okay and I still got water started to come in right okay nothing's going to be perfect unless the guys seen on the commercial that uses all right are we all in agreement uh to purchase this device I am yes and extra bags extra bags okay am I good with that yep all right last item uh discussion on Marina waitlist policy take it away Mike Sable this is this last revision that he provided us with um and it addressed like some of the I think at one point he had that the uh foreign like the longest boat one but then he made an adjustment here where he started but let you at the bottom of the list um and then as you move up if you you're offered and you deny you go back down to the bottom um so it it you you select what what uh size um you got what we call them category of slip or sizes slip group wait list you want to be on and then you're on you're committed to that one um so that um so then at that point you're you're on there by the date you got on versus you're not getting jumped by the guy who's got the longer boat in that in that group and um I don't know if there's anything else that we saw jump out when I went back through it um you know this little things like um she'll throw out a uh Maria waitlist for him I'm just gonna have that the form we currently use on the website very rarely we actually have a paper form someone's got to fill out um it was there was one thing that uh that I uh one comment I received from someone in the community uh they felt that the 180 days versus 90 days that's uh basically they wanted it the same for everyone uh I I realized that it's easier to buy a smaller boat but um they just thought that it should be the same across the board and I I agree so if we had to do one or the other are we doing 90. I don't think 90 is acceptable because vote okay what um and then what they're paying how much are they paying for that slip rental while we're waiting for the not the bottom not the cheapest price right I think they were paying the maximum to hold it I think they should I don't know if we talked about it but I think they should yeah until they get I mean that's good I mean that's incentive they're not gonna get right maximization I mean you're you're paying a premium price to hold a spot so you can actually go find a boat and uh there's many places that won't allow that and so I think that that's something that we're offering a service and uh and then it says um we'll specifying the applications so you'll collect a deposit so I think that should be the one month of the maximum the deposit amount yeah yeah and then um says once the African has notified of the open slip and accepts the retinal Beat Again from the Cell Pro later for that month um but I wanted to put something in there that they that each waitlist applicant will get um 72 hours because we gotta have some kind of like from formerly notify and we call and leave a message email their email address and then from there it's like gotta set a time limit oh yeah 72 hours yeah yeah to to get back yeah I want this slipper I don't want the slip give it to the next guy right is that that's all you guys that's what I've done in the past it seemed to work I'd be like I need to know in 72 hours and what if you can't reach them in 72 hours there's a question I mean maybe it's 72 hours upon uh I mean I mean you're next in line and I and I can't reach you uh at what point do you say I I've done everything I can I'm moving on to the next person I would well I would say like and we can explain this maybe in the in the waitlist application that we will call the number leave a message and we'll email the email address from there the clock starts and if you don't respond in 72 hours then you're out so you require an email and a phone number I think yeah try it again yeah that's that's fair if you're overseas or something yeah yeah you'll get one of those Communications yeah um oh and then it says assignments are prioritized at no time or any household regardless of how many homes the applicant may have in dollar Beach have two or more boats registered at the marina so does that mean because we do have one situation where there's a household that has two boats at the marina are we gonna just is that a grandfather thing at this point and then is that even a household here technically now non-resident where they live just because they have rental property here yes yeah I I I'm not really sure how you evict a boat but uh that's a situation that uh they're probably going to say well I'm grandfathered in and you need to allow me to keep it but uh there should be a mechanism in place for addressing this do they renew their agreements at any time the agreement just runs just which is wrong I mean we have the option cancel at any time but you know well what I would say is that everybody that's down there needs to reapply and they're first on the list except for the person who has two boats and then they get one vote and and you know first dibs but not both how long has that been going on I mean that's a tough one because how long now I gotta I'll say eight years or so well they were they were almost two separates those two they had bathroom when I came in got here oh okay right that's I think it's always been that way right I don't even know who it is but I know that that's been an ongoing concern for the city like we've got one family with two boats in the marina and they don't even live in the city they just own property right nobody else is going to deal with the fact that they you know it all goes back to we have them install the lifts and then we're are they both on Lowes yeah they pay us a little less and how big are their slips how much do they pay I'd still get back to we're not charging at all it's just like the beach barking we just don't charge enough for as as valuable as that property is we don't charge enough for those slips and I know that I'll get kicked back from everyone that's down there but I bet other citizens would agree with me other citizens that are trying to put their vote in a slip I guess that's what you would if you wanted to you increase the non-resident rate we've done this we know more because you know that way you're not we only haven't heard your residence but a handful of non-residents yeah I mean I I just I think that uh I know how hard it is to get your vote in a Marina and a slip and a high and dry even on a trailer in storage somewhere it's impossible and uh yeah we've got residence running slips for next to nothing I mean I don't I don't but I've been down that road before and no one agreed with me so we have what 30s how many slips too uh 18. 18 hay bales actually it was just one residence um I don't know that's a tough one but it's an ongoing issue well we need to make a decision on it because this sets the uh sets the standard um was to was to keep somebody else from wanting a second vote and you can't I think I can't Mike did a real good job I think Mike did a real good job in this whole thing he did yeah I think if we if we do allow the grandfather card then you know we would not allow any future households to have more than one vote but if you're already in there and you've paid for the lives that scene is kind of hard my original idea uh whenever I took a stab at this was to give them a time frame to find another place to set one of the boats so you know it's it's not that hard to find slips they're all over the place they're still available you can you can go to Clearwater Marina and find a slip right now um all right it's not Bel Air Peach and and would it cost more money typically I'm sure it would you can't have a lift you'd be which I don't know which flu or Marina you're talking City municipal on this side or that side the other side yeah can't have a lift your boat okay and you said both the boats are on lifts they don't have a big boat that's in water no most boats over there are on less aren't they all the three there's a couple that are in water one of them two sailboats at least so we don't mandate that they use the lift okay you just believe around it that they take responsibility for and they remove it when they're done okay you know I would say give them a year and pick one I think that's fair okay no I was talking to Lynn about this when somebody leaves that Marina they take the lift out or because he said they're told they have to take the lift out yeah it's elastic and I'm doing agreement with uh I think I do it all on their own okay but the rift has to technically come out or a new owner has to agree that is a little weird you know yeah and the problem is is no one may most people don't maintain their lips and you know that's why we have you know neighbors where their boats are hanging off the you know because they didn't maintain a lift so we don't want to take that responsibility as a city yeah it's a big deal maintaining one would that be our responsibility to lift if it would fail not yeah with the amendment to the contract that we do but we do like right yeah I think that's fair Dave uh one year notice and just you know with an explanation of we have such a long waiting list and we're limiting yeah one vote for also so maybe I could clean up this um and then we could uh you know I want to lay out you know if this didn't include the different categories like we had before but Cali out the fee structure the categories and then can we pass this policy by resolution and somehow include the new because they're trying to wean them down to one boat per family within a year I mean we can definitely pass a resolution as far as the procedural elements of getting the the new Arena policy you know codified or established as far as the you know um the phasing any single slip owner down from two to one I'd wanna I'd wanna look at that a little bit more than I have the option of doing at this moment especially given some of the the history of that I just want to make sure that I'm guiding you right and I don't feel comfortable doing that on the fly in this moment all right and I I would like to see if they talk about exhibit a the marina wait list form and exhibit B the annual confirmation of Interest form can we get copies of those I'd like to change that around to something more electronic um because for the last like five years I've been doing it via email it's just a lot quicker turn around and then yeah like I said we've changed that form to the website but I mean I want to reward that okay oh then look at that the way that section 2A is written I think that language can be clear up you know no more than one vote you know it's I right now it should have two or more boats registered to the marina I just I don't that sentence could be clean yeah but you know just kind of focus on that a little bit and I'll get uh returning more at a review as well um and then I it was all the license Z and for some reason he wanted to change it to renter but I believe our uh our agreement says license Z so I was going to change that back and then have her uh so whoever has the license of the vote also is the runner of the yeah yeah it's not it's a license agreement because look I could go rent the slip and then give it to yeah who doesn't live in the community right right when do we receive a cleaned up copy of this not not that Randy has anything to do yeah yeah and I want to kind of like let's I take a safe date with I would say the November meeting because I'd like to go over the uh the actual agreement to yeah I'd like to see y'all see it all together and then also pricing this kind of again a recap of where we're at versus I mean just to where we're at is what we're charging currently sure and what the new price structure is going to look like so we can all agree that that's Etc we've been talking about this for years now and uh if we have to wait another month or two to get it wrapped up and so be it I'm just glad to see there's some progress being made on this any other questions or comments about this topic no General business do we have any general business um we have because of members able resigning we have to do signature cards for our accounts um in discussion with vice mayor I think instead of getting everybody's signature I don't think we really need to get every council member signature um maybe get like the mayor um council member Notaro and Mary councilmember Roberts because based on or or council member Banker based on who's local that can be in the area almost like a sign checks okay yeah so I think theoretically we're all local yeah but my suggestion sign checks and I don't really need any additional liability so I'm only two blocks away you often sign Leslie's here often so I suggested those two and I'm like just randomly pick some other council member at least have three so if you can't get a hold of someone but there's no need to get signature cards every time there's a change in it I understand yeah okay um just get this is the form whatever works okay um uh have we had any applicants yet before the council see um I did notice coming in today that the notice on the board out there is a bigger print than it was that's called desperation you know we may have to turn up the volume [Laughter] I saw there was a cut off date like the 25th or something right we need to adjust that they may be waiting to see who else applies you know well uh we'll wait till The Bitter End and see what happens but for the charter that person gets appointed and then they that position gets elected the next so in March that position gets elected somebody in October when marshroll's around they'd have to be a lot better than something yeah yeah they would have to go through the regular yeah but he's finished He's Able he or she's finishing zables doesn't matter it's the next election the next election yeah when we were talking about Glenn's no no they wouldn't have to run again he would finish the term yes see no the next election is your term in but yeah so the person that you point on put on wouldn't go off until your turn correct yes okay they wanted to stay in they had to run in the next election Belinda this term is is a lens yes so that's up right right mics because I'll be up until the phone yeah correct so what is the answer can you movie manager yes I don't want to do it right this second because I want to make sure I'm reading the language so you technically move Belinda two is able no no no because they were put into that you're put into the seat specific for that purpose even though you guys don't know I was saying our Charter says it's the next election that's what I read he wants to verify it is that's how we've always done it it's the next election for their term right it says the annual election next election no that would not make sense because then you would be flip-flopping the cycle of the elections correct here's the language filling with vacancies a vacancy on the council shout this is section 2.06 Sub C a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council which we're all in agreement is what's happening any person appointed by Council to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual election in the city wow but I get with you theoretically you could you could make it to where everybody's I mean if enough people resigned all of a sudden all seven or five council members would run yeah every year you have one election every every three years and that would be the end of that no no I don't think it would work that way I think that they would run but then they would serve the remainder of that term still so you're still on the cycle that's not what you read though yeah well that's at their next election correct okay and they in our terms are right now three years so let's so the way the way that I'm reading that and again this will require some follow-up so just in case there's any well you said this I I'm doing it on the Fly the way that I would interpret that as I read this is let's say you I had this happen to me in another community so I use another Community somebody's elected in March for a three-year term right and then in may they realize all the stuff they wanted to do they can't do they say you know what I'm not sitting around for three years to do that and so the council says fine we'll appoint somebody and then you get to March that happens in March 2024. when March 2025 comes around that position that was filled in May of the year before eight months it's up to the election and they serve the remaining two years of that term it doesn't start a new three-year cycle it's just an election to throw the remaining tenure of that term of that of that scene so you you okay and so in this case if we appoint somebody to replace Mike Sable then an election would happen but it would not be that person who was going they were an election that is going to happen between that term and in other words it's an election for the balance an election is going to happen then it's not going to impact the appointee no it sounds like the appointments the points you have the opportunity to run let's say you appointed somebody tomorrow to zabel's position the way that I'm reading this that person would serve from September 19th tomorrow to March 19 2023. okay they have the option to run through that position in the March election and qualify in December um and if they do they are one of the candidates eligible for that seat but that election is for the balance of Mr zabel's term which I believe runs in 2025. that makes sense so they would run to third give us one more year okay and so what we need to do in our qualifying period as that approaches is Mark are you running for that particular vacancy or just or establish how that will be handled which is its own issue we now have to address can I Twitter wrench in there oh that's absolutely it's a gift so the way it is right now come March the three highest vote debtors I'm getting they're six people running five people whatever three highest note Getters get put on Caravans so would it be the two highest vote letters stayed for three years and then the third highest or the third lowest or whatever finish up zabel's turn you know what I'm saying you're saying and that's what I'm trying to wrestle with in my head is how do we address that in our and it may be that we we address it in our resolution that calls for the election um remember if we've already adopted it because I can't remember where we are in the process but we either established that if it's two vacancies plus I think it's actually three vacancies plus disables um so that would be four right um in which case it would be the top three we could do it either the top three get the ordinary seats and fourth place gets the bridge term where we could say in during the qualifying period there are three seats that are up for at least three year terms and one seat that has one year left which one would you like to run yeah but how about the voter trying to figure that out can I just say before this conversation goes much further that it's probably best that you research it talk to Patty about history yep and um it might be a Char amendment that needs to be looked at because that's not how it's been handled in the past and we can we can have that discussion we can talk about all of them that's why I come with all the caveats this is a discussion on the Fly later yeah and I would also say that with the caveat um of just because we did it one way doesn't mean that's how you're always supposed to do it yeah um so I I reserve the right to make my own independent conclusions talking with Patty and the manager and we will address that that sounds good to adjourn uh not yet um I wanted to let you guys know that um I don't know if you received the alert Pinellas thing today I looked at it and uh the county said that they are making repairs uh starting in Sunset Beach Treasure Island um but then I got a report that they are just dumping sand on existing Dunes so I don't know what the heck they're doing yet but stay tuned I'm gonna get to the bottom of it and I'll let you know uh also the county decided to go ahead I I suspect this is what they're doing they're they're uh I've been invited to a uh some sort of a press release um gathering at the Rays stadium tomorrow at 10 30. I suspect the county is going to say we're we're doing it we're we're gonna do this this Grand new baseball no not beach nourishment the Ray stadium right oh I've already heard it yeah well I know that they we all knew that they would but um and what they do you know we need to people aren't going to come down and see the raise unless they can go to the beach exactly yeah well well I have to um at the TDC meeting they said uh I don't know if anyone was actually here whenever The Big C whenever we we hosted The Big C they they painted a picture of Doom and Gloom that if they funded it themselves we were all gonna go broke um the FEMA would turn their backs on us um you see this Army Corps won't budge well that includes FEMA they're not doing anything for us see anyway as far as replenishing the sand on our beaches uh but they they said there's no way we can do it and and they Danced All Around well at the at the TV The Joint TDC meeting it was the board of County Commissioners and the TDC uh Janet long said we have the money to do everything so they've got the money to do the Rays stadium they've got the money to renourish our beaches they've got the money to do something for the Phillies and they've got the money to do um a project over on toy town of course Sports Complex let's keep the Phillies side there I can't really knows is that um there suddenly they have this unlimited well have you seen how much you're charging in taxes I mean that's well it's it's bed packs that's where all those projects come from it's not what we're being charged uh at home it's for if you if you own a hotel when you think assessments are ridiculous that they're hitting they're hitting the residents with too but he said it and everyone said it you're not going to get a bed tax if you don't have people going to the beach right you know so well right now what I'm doing from them is that they're only going to nourish the most uh damaged beaches and I say to them that they're all damaged and what the heck having to assess that so I spoke to uh Kathleen Peters and she walked up to me at the end of the meeting and she said I was able to do a flyover her and I looked at all of the beaches and Bel Air Beach was by far the worst she said that Sunset Beach and Treasure Island was number two and that North Weddington Beach was number three so why they decided to go and dump sand on an existing Dune in Treasure Island I have no idea but I'm going to ask some tough questions in the next next couple of days and try to find out what's the point what's the real plan because so far I've not heard any plan other than we're going to do the some places that need sand here's sixth straight at three o'clock today with the tide going out yeah there's nothing yeah it's awful yeah another another thing is that um I've been speaking with Kyle um I I a certain uh representative assured me that she she should be able to get us some money to help with storm damage and so I asked Kyle what it you know what what's damaged and he said 400 bucks and um what what come on man I mean like I said that the rest of the damage that most of our loss is the beach um but if you want to tie into we're going to try and extend those boardwalks that's the damage there's no sand underneath and our beaches are inaccessible right now so uh I uh he quickly came up with a better number and I've passed that along and uh we'll see if that person is able to come through for us good um but I'll also let you know that what what she's trying to do is piggyback on the damage that happened at Indian Rocks Beach so we're you know because they lost a lot of access is there in big trouble same deal so maybe maybe they'll come through so that that's something that we talked about is you know extending those walkovers because I mean it's a good four foot drop you know yeah it is [Music] doing stairs I was I want to see what the cost would be for both and and again right now if you keep the same angle it looks like it's gonna have to extend the ramps you have to extend 10 to 12 feet which will pretty much put it in the water most of the time um maybe we can bend it so you know go up the beach or something like that yeah um look at some options I mean or maybe or maybe do stairs I'm going and then get and then at least have one that's like accessible to the electric Indian Rocks just pulled some of the planks up and you just come right on the beach now and then you got the walkway railings but you don't have no planks now on some of the accesses because there's no place to go now you know [Music] we do is because the state required us to be like 18 two feet 18 inches two feet clearance over the dune but people wonder why we have such steep they have angles no it doesn't have to be no it doesn't have to be here it would have took a lot more ramp make an Ada so we definitely I mean making you know Morgan Street they can you know that's 88 for the fine right to get out to the beach but um so so you're trying to figure out a plan but I would say make sure that we budget get that in the budget and get that done you know started sooner rather than later it's been a while and it's gonna I mean I've gone out there and I'm like I'm not jumping off of that I know you know I don't know how to get back up if I went down to the beach right it's gonna be it's going to be tough feet tall and it's about a lot of boardwalks right now so carefully because that'll require permitting too won't it you got to get the state permitting for the beach yeah and that's another thing how long how far out are they going to let us put stuff I see all right any other General business I uh I know when we hired Kyle it was for a two-year freeze but Disney's been exceptional to this city you put a lot of dedication in and I think he deserves a raise like every other employee this year especially with Dynamics facing relationships gambling I think this Council should really take consideration and giving him at least the same raise every other employees I'm sure other people are even looking at in other settings right now I would hate to lose them I think this Council should give him a five percent raise I think he's well deserved any comments how does your situation work from your position is it based on your when you started a new position 12 months from that period yes uh contracts started I think it was November 24th okay we'll have to change your voice but it does something you can we normally do reviews and February and so I was planning on um sending out the review paperwork next month so give like a month and a half before but annual term since we're on the subject I brought this up with uh attorney Mora I currently have 44 hours of vacation leave on the books for myself in November I get another 15 days on top of that technically my contract says I can only carry over 30 days um right now would be a struggle to use right to get to get down um and use it like it says technically I'm I'm violating it right now because I have 44 days and I think this is a Max I can actually have it one times 40. but I don't know if there's any option um you would like to extend that I could do something because I don't even if I was to take a day a week you know recent weeks to irritating a while so if you're gonna would you want them to continue to accumulate or would you want to get paid out on them I would take a payout deal because I mean it's just hard to take that kind of vacation so when you say but it's important that you take time off too so I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna say that but you know you know um I don't know what that looks like I don't know what the rest of the you know now we're wrapping up budget I know it's you know we're still in kind of some hurricane Touch and Go type time but it's not I think we've gotten through the worst of that so take a look at it and see how much of that time you could use I mean I'm not opposed to given looking at allowing me to accumulate more but if you could take a vacation and we could pay you out some and you could have a little extra cash to take that vacation that might be a way to accommodate the problem okay as of right now I'm planning on a vacation um the second week of the holidays so that would go into I think it's December 29th and then I would come back the 7th before the meeting on the 8th in January so that would use five we don't engage in that I don't think an hour yeah normally normally from my experience is what you carry over so you said you're 30 30 days was the max right so the 15 you're gonna get the next fiscal year that doesn't count so let's say you can't have a maximum on here he's so important with the new personal policy changes he carries 30 right he's presently at 44. right so if he acquires another 15 he's functionally exceeding half of his accrued leave time is his concern and if that's a benefit to say he can't carry more than 30 over so for the next true over the calendar year so I technically after the end of December oh okay because he had a bunch of times yeah it's a solution really the best solution is to do a payout and get you down to a reasonable amount of vacation instead of this you know this week and we can do an amendment to his agreement that contemplates that because that's not contemplated by the Personnel policy and his leave is generally governed by the Personnel policy which we recently amended um and so if we if you wanted to do that the cleanest way would probably be an amendment to his employment agreement that addresses this that we could you could all you could provide for payout and at what rate and also you know if you wish to say he can accrue more or shall not accrue up to you know make that number something different you can do that too it's a contract we can do whatever we want at that point so we could just make it whatever this I think that's what I would like to see is uh is let's let's pay him give him a payout for his his vacation I don't I don't know how much you know I would probably need to come up with something reasonable because that's a big there's a big check to walk out with to cash it all out and we wouldn't want you to do that we do want you to use your vacation time uh at the same time put something in there that will incentivize him to take vacation correct and that was the other you know you guys in the city are my client here and so you know my other concern for you as a council is you wouldn't want you couldn't you wouldn't want to put yourself in a position where he accused so much time and then whether he leaves in you know two years or 20 years you're paying out 80 120 hours because you're just sit in the bank and I've seen that happen in communities where it's like now they're time to go and wow that's a huge liability we want to manage that in a way that incentivizes and also caps you know at any given time we know that it's going to be afforded because anything that's not used by calendar date shall be paid out in some X as for example as a way to automatically draw it down if you haven't used it then you know we'll just cash that out at the end of the years another way so we can put something together um and present it to you for consideration as a contract reopening right so um go ahead yeah oh yes I say something you you can um as far as incentivized because I'm exceeding mine too we have incentive we don't need it we struggle to take time off because one week you're preparing an agenda the next week you're sending it out then the next week you're preparing the work session and the next week you're sending it out so it's kind of like we struggle to find time you know unless you take two days before the agenda or three days after and well that's I heard that Latin clear he would be back for the meeting on the 8th and I'm like why don't we just push the meeting out another week too so you could actually take a vacation and not take five days and come rushing back to be for a meeting you know well as uh it's not intentional I know but see that the table has turned a little bit as a good manager with a good Administrative Assistant that that person should be able to lighten some of the load to where you can afford to take a day off or a few days off or whatever I mean it really how about the new hire does that help any eventually when she's trained right yes she help more than anyone so far before her so yes she's she seems like I mean I have I'll have a lot of experience but she's already helping me but she's Spanish so you're in the same position you're in the same position right now you have too many days who else just her it's not yours isn't quite as bad but you're at sequels per pay period yeah so it's different it doesn't get done um but will you seven hours up or seven or seven days of seven especially like 37. so technically she's not over the 40 that she can have at one time but but technically by the calendar year she's supposed to be at 30. so why don't you provide us exactly the details and what it looks like and then any vacation either of you have planned and do we need to move meetings between now and the end of the year to accommodate your vacations I mean I hate to say it that way but I think we need to be accommodating too yeah of course yeah absolutely and you know I don't mean to complain or anything no no yeah explain why we have that you should we ever take a full week I want you to get some rest [Laughter] you can hear these people are putting in too much time and we're not rewarding them enough we're a small community and and we will do everything we can to work around you um and as far as Mr bankers comment about we're not paying people enough I tend to agree uh but but on the other hand um uh we have to do this in a way to where we're not we're not straying from our agreements so um whenever I would like for us to at least get to the reviews and then that way once we have the reviews done we can sit down as a group and decide what it is we'd like to do thank you yes so your lead structure if I remember correctly is reviewing you don't have the separation of six one year and I do know the separation I I opted to keep because I had a lot of sick time okay okay yeah okay and Patty's I'm sure the same way you got sick and annual right yes now you can't donate your leave like if you want to give your leave to me I can take time off a co-worker I tell you what she can give you as much time as she wants to but you have to adhere to the rate of pay that you that you get currency I guess back to that just Dave and I had a little sound conversation but the review for Kyle since we're coming up on your running one year anniversary could be prior to the February March when we normally do theirs right yeah we do hers anymore February March February and then the raise is typically I would like if she's um if you're struggling with your vacation days and you want to get rid of some I think that while this is going on for his vacation time I'd like for you to look at both of them and see if there's something that we can do a one-time all right let's get them caught up to where they have a reasonable amount of days they've uh uh gotten some extra money in their pocket and uh and then hopefully we'll get this under control and we won't have to do this exercise again yeah that sounds gonna do that uh the managers could be as simple as an employment agreement it's my understanding Patty doesn't have a separate employment agreement um just found by the Personnel policy in which case it may be a resolution and further amending the Personnel policy and and that can be narrowly tailored to address that okay any other General business or would everyone like to go home motion to adjourn do I have a second second all in favor aye any opposed anyone anyone all right good night everyone awesome"
