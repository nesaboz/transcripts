    "transcript": "5:00 so we are here to convene a meeting of the audit Committee of the city of Delair Beach welcome everyone U let's just go around the table and do a roll call um get my she Rod sigic Mark Goldman John hansik and Kim Shaw Elliot I'm zooming in we have Heather Heather guoli of our Financial Consultant this is Kyle reair city manager very good all right so I don't know if anybody's had a chance to look at the minutes of the last meeting um I did I move that they be approved as submitted I'll second it very good we have a motion to approve the minutes from the last meeting and a second all in favor I I any opposed very good the minutes are approved secondly we have a mo uh do we hear a motion to approve the minutes of the July 12th 20223 audit committee meeting minutes do we have that on the agenda is that what this is no this you're reading the old oh gosh I'm forgive me I'm on the wrong page um so I don't think we approved the tonight's agenda that's right okay so that was for the the motion was for the April 16 audit committee minutes I apologize for that error uh now for the business of today we are here to review and evaluate the requests for proposals for certified public accountants to provide audit services to our city uh we have had uh five responses to our request for proposal they include CS L CPA James Moren company Markham salt marsh and Wells Hower and shotel I think uh how we might go about this is uh I think uh we need to approve the agenda thank you all motion approval for the agenda thank you Ron any second to approve today's agenda second thank you very much we have a motion and a second to approve the agenda for today all in favor I I I any opposed the agenda is approved thank you for that um what I would suggest for tonight is maybe if we just kind of I'm sorry let Heather just some input that's for oh you're chair no AUD of committee is you were last year I know yeah I didn't know changed no it's so yeah remember K is chair last year I believe Jody Shirley was the representative oh yeah my bad you can just cross standard John um Heather as we begin would you like to make any introductory remarks um I I don't know how you're going to approach your ranking I did not give them number ranking um I have here you know the the ranking criteria like you all have seen and I just kind of made notes on each one so depending on your approach of how you want to go through it I was kind of going to just give my input as we go that that is fine and um I'm open to any suggestions from the group but I was thinking that we might just go by one by one for each proposal uh go around the table and get everyone's input on each one it would be great if we can reach a consensus on ratings but we we can also do that individually and and then just see where we are so anybody have any thoughts look at look at a Mark's cheat sheet my cheat sheet we've already eval yeah I have evaluated R this is um it's rather a the criteria for having a u suitable auditor is pretty it's a pretty regulated um Venture that we've taken on um first of all to be an auditor for municipality is is heavily regulated with certain levels of experience and certain people on their staff in certain years of everything the RFP that we put out certainly captured the most important pieces of qualifications that they they all should have um if we take away a lot of the fluff that's in there and the take the pricing away I think any of those firms could do the job and as long as they delivered as they said they would deliver and ask for the assistance they said they would ask for I think any of them could qualify for it um now that being said there are some innuendo things about each one uh for my take on it there's enough flexibility in any RFP that they could perform their tasks and meet our needs easily uh with the qualifications that they all have so um I didn't find it extremely hard to differentiate between the bunch of them because they all seem to meet the requirements at least the ones that were in the RFB and um so I guess what I'm saying is that uh there's not a whole lot of discriminating features between them all um that is would change substantively my rating of them uh I didn't um I didn't find anybody with failing grades so to speak or without the characteristics of the what we want for an auditor so that being said I think it's it's a matter of uh past experience with with the Auditors that uh have made the list uh if anyone has any information uh to share outside of the questions to the RFB or something that they received that we and I'll get like a letter of reference or something that they can relate um uh then I think it's just a matter of doing the accounting but uh that's just my point of view anybody else have any preliminary comments yeah know I think Mark summarized it pretty well they all have a good they all have good track records I think the difference is do we want somebody local um do we want to be able to come into the office toes other want to you shake hands and meet meet them on occasion cuz some are strictly 100% remote and some are they claim they're in Tampa but they're really South Florida or somewhere else but um you I think you those are the um and as much of anything Heather sees in other cities uh within her firm and so she knows who's the good the bad the indifferent so um definitely curious to Heather's Insight yeah for sure but if I you I don't know who that first person was speaking but I agree with what that assessment I I agree all of these firms could definitely do a quality audit um and then that would R second I recognize his L um there are definitely nuances that that's basically what my notes say um the pieces that stuck out to me are exactly like you said are they going to be auditing completely remotely um are they going to have a physical presence those are the things things um that I would take into consideration and also one of the big things is that I really like the idea of someone that's audited someone in pelis County um like we have certain we have P for pelis for example you know just the relationship between us as canel County and then the municipalities here um I like the idea of someone that's familiar with that not to just exclude anyone that has has already done an audit of County but those are the things that I definitely um picked out as well this is Kim I appreciate those comments and I I think I can Echo what everyone else has said I think uh there CPA so there's certain credential credentialing that everybody has to have so they're all going to be qualified to a certain extent um the the beauty of uh the work of a CPA is that there are actual rules on how things need to be done and so uh takes a lot of the gray out of it which is nice um the the distinguishing factors come into what everybody's already just said I think their proximity um their uh their familiarity with our region certainly with our Coastal issues but also with the size of the the smaller size of our pelis County communities um and uh also the desire to either be uh remote or to have availability uh um on site and Heather what are your thoughts about that because they'd be dealing with you um so the last few years so the existing Auditors that are they off theya Mar they rid um they've done an audit completely remotely the staff accountants that work on our job the the lead um was in Texas um we've had different staff accountants from Georgia North Florida the Personnel on our audit has changed over the years but I've never met any of them in person with the exception of the managing shareholder which is Chu Landers he's the one that comes and you've seen him at the City Council meetings um so I'm fine with that you know doing it completely remotely um but also part of me is a little old school and I used to be an auditor that used to poop down in conference rooms and speak to the actual humans that work in an office um so I think that there is some maybe added value in that um there was a lot of emails and phone calls um between me and salt marsh and they also were the Auditors at another municipality um and so I don't really have a strong preference one way or another as long as they're available and part of it is that I'm not there all the time so if they need something I I need to be able to provide it to them so that's where the phone calls and emailing me personally comes in but I worked through it and it's fine um whoever was talking first said you know to take out the fluff out of all these I agree with that as well like a lot of these rfcs did have a you know fancy graphics and and things like that but as far as the audit process and the procedures that they have to do like you said Tim there are designated things that they have to do and everyone's going to do it whether they have a fancy proposal or not um I did like that some of the RS spelled out the audit approach for someone that isn't maybe familiar with what all goes into an audit um but again I all of them would be qualified I will say Sal Marsh and I know we talk we said you include the price consideration but they were three times higher um that I have a hard time picking somebody with such a cost disparity um and also we weren't really pleased with them this past year with the timing of the report it's been a couple years Heather yeah it's been a couple years that they've been that's you know kind of your point you the two that stood out to me that actually gave some timelines was Markham and Wells Hower you know that said you know we're going to deliver by this date and you're going to have it all done and we'll get the gfo you know submitted timely and so right you know those are the intangible things that jumped out to me and then on Wells the other intangible was you know they committed to no change um in a partner uh without 30 days notice to the city manager where we asked them all to make that kind of a commitment but they were the only ones that I could see when I went through them all that actually made that promise um yeah so I it's interesting that you take that out too because Kyle and I had a brief conversation about that the other today they were the one they really I felt like went through our RFP and answered all the questions that we had they committed to all of the things that we said um they were they had the least amount of flu no Graphics you know it was just what we asked for um but I I definitely agree with that yeah no I I uh I I thought that they responded you know like you said just specifically to the to the RFP um and they didn't wander into how pounding their own chest you got to love Markham who put pictures of belir clearw beach at s key on the cover of their proposal those are just things that as a person who used to give these kind of proposals you go like what what oh not why didn't you think I do need to tell you this so Weller and CH they're the Auditors for Readington Shores now that's my other municipality that I work at but they're also the firm that I used to work for I worked for them as an auditor for like 12 years so I know them inside and out um and I want to put that out there before our discussion goes any further um in case that all right so you can't vote you're conflicted out as long as you're not a consultant anymore out I'm out of there I like being on this side a lot better being a and and I think um for salt marsh they were just sending a message there nothing more than that uh you know I wouldn't even I didn't even consider raing them um because you don't do that and that was almost like a slap in the face you don't that it is and I felt that way too like man you really don't want to work with me anymore yeah I I didn't know I didn't know it was because of you well it feels like it is no I don't think so I don't think so but they make that one easy that that was that was rated the low I at least rated him but no I I wouldn't even rate him because that was so ridiculous why waste your time that's like really all righty well why don't we then begin um let's start with the first one listed which is CS and L Ron should we start com you might have about them yeah no these guys um put together a good uh proposal they you I mean do you want to you want me to fill out the chart as we go along that's fine I've already done mine I can tell you if we just want to rate them as we go I got one here got one okay but you for for the qualifications experience and expertise I put him as um I gave him 40 points 40 um what was the one thing so the one thing that I kind of took is uh a negative was they talked about the Tampa office but all the people were out of brington so I took five points off for them being braed Bas so that was my thought there on the audit approach um I gave him a 25 here's um they didn't provide a calendar so that's why I gave them a discount there on their uh references um they only gave one year I gave them 10 cuz they only gave references for one year um that they the the cities or municipalities that they were oning they only had a onee window and then the fee I did give them a 10 because they were the cheapest so overall they were at an 85 for me thank you Mark your thoughts oh on csnl is that where we are yes I gave them an overall rating of 90 believe that's right not 90 I was I was at 85 7 told yeah then it would have been 90 for me 15 45 90 yeah so what you what you have for qualifications experience uh 45 approaches 25 that's 70 and um responses was 1585 do they have any responses of references yeah I I spoke to the woman I called um their reference at the city of brazington and she said that they're very happy with them I don't know if you were able to see my notes on that neighbors neighboring to City Hall their particular audit like they would literally walk from their office to field work at the city um and she but you know it was hard for me to tell whether or not they're going to come here to us in person but she said that they were very happy with that good what' you get for her fee for total or fe uh 10 10 okay that's 95 95 Mr Hansen I'm pretty much in line with what Ron did looking at him um and one comment about Markham actually uh my organization is looking at them for auditing and providing a uh part-time finance officer our fin our budget committee met last week and uh we're now have to wait I need to wait for my executive director to come off a vacation but uh um our proposal was to go forward with Markham to do uh their stuff but yeah this proposal is similar to uh what we got up there at headquarters um but yeah my my scores align with uh Ron um 40 for qualifications audit approach was 25 response to references was 10 and the fee was 10 for a total of the 85 okay on mine um for the uh qualifications I gave a 42 um I like the fact that they said that uh Florida municipalities are a core part of their practice that it's 90% of their Auditors work on Municipal engagements uh 20 of their current clients are governmental and Municipal uh clients so that was a good fact they did state that they would not use subcontractors um they uh have experience with it's cities of comparable size but um Bron is obviously a much larger more complex city than ours um and they have 10 staff members on the government team which of course staff is important to be able to support the Auditors uh regarding the um let's see the audit approach uh again everybody's going to pretty much have the same but excuse me second La lost where I am let's see that was a total of 30 points yes okay uh I thought uh they were responsive without a lot of fluff in their proposal which was good um oh yes the the point here was that uh the city is to prepare the schedules and the confirmations um with the expectation that we'll be doing their part and then they pick up and do their part from an audit perspective and Heather was that a good approach for you yeah that's fine I mean I do prepare those anyway okay so um I would give them a 28 on the audit approach now uh references did they receive oh we just said there was a reference and it was good so we'll give them 15 on the references and the proposed fee which was the cheapest one that was offered so I'd certainly give them a 10 on the fee and if somebody's better than ma than me5 okay what was yours on the references again please 15 15 because they had a solid good reference thank you okay anything else on csnl and Heather do you have any particular comments about them no like I said the woman from Bron seemed very happy I did like their proposal um the only thing against that was a knock against them and it's really not a knock against them is that they're their closest client was the city of brington and then like Ron said you know they have a Tampa office the thing the other thing I have in my notes here they talked about and I don't know if you guys picked up on this at all but there they put in there that they use idea and caseware software that's data mining um we're very small we don't have that many transactions but um and I'm not even sure how they would really use that but that's you know software that they would be using to look into our accounting records and identify irregularities and try to focus their sampling um so were the only one that well no they're not the only ones but I I did note this that those two softwares were noted um it doesn't really matter to me and then like P Point him I do prepare a lot of schedules already and the confirmations and stuff so I'm going to continue to do what I do um whether they use them or not you know as I guess up to them but I liked them overall I thought they were yeah well good thank you let's move on to James Moren company want to switch the order John do you want to give your thoughts first I'll keep going okay go run go run just got to find out where I put should put it in your order off my chatchi uh um so I gave 40 um for presentation again the discount um was there Daytona based and the uh the lead Partners a ad junk professor at ston so if he's over we know he's on the other coast then um I gave him a 27 on the audit approach I I can't find that page oh there it is um they gave the three steps of that they'd go through but they didn't actually put a calendar in place so that's probably why there why there was the discount um references I put 12 and um I like the city cities I like you know they put down you madira Beach SE Beach Indian Shores but they didn't list if they did GFA for any of them so I assume they didn't so that's why I discounted that and then for the pro proposed fee I put them in an eight so alog together they're at an 87 thank you Mr Goldman uh I've got them at 45 approach 27 references I have them at 15 I I know they're not we didn't get personal signatures on references but if we endeavored to check every one of the people that they did current audits for they we would have found that there was no complaints or else they wouldn't have put them down there yeah we know that's how that's how they work yeah and I I came ATT 10 on the proposed fee so what was that total 25 70 97 those are high Marks Mr Hand okay um 39 for experience and expertise a of approach 25 because they again same thing with Ron no dates time frames uh do um I'm going to do 12 on the references and for the fee I'll give them a nine you're have to make me break out a calculator on this one okay I got one okay 76 oops oh I got to put my get into it first I think it's an 85 5 there we go I'm in now [Music] 85 85 all right your turn all right um for me uh I'm sure this is a highly qualified firm but somehow another it just wasn't a standout for me it just seemed rather um uh routinized it was just a a rather routine fluffy presentation so so for qualifications I rank them at 40 the audit approach 25 uh the uh references 10 uh cuz I don't think any of them were personalized uh the fee at 8 655 758 is is that 83 83 yep all right moving on to Markham uh yes S I already made my comment cover page had pick of cities other than ours but um uh let's see AIT approach I gave him a 40 um they noted a Tampa office but the principles look like South Florida so that's why I had them 40 then I had him at a 27 for procedure oh wait I'm sorry I'm looking at the wrong Callum ad 30 cuz they did give a calendar on the audit approach okay and then on the references I put them at 11 again only one to three years and then no GFA noted then on fee I put them at a four so I had an 85 total yeah Mr goldan 45 on qualifications 30 approach 12 references and six three okay they have a total on that 93 82 or 83 H what did you say 93 93 Mr Hansen okay Mark 39 for experience qualifications uh 25 for the audit approach references 11 fee give them a four um add that up I didn't get to that part like I said I got interrupted by a phone call before I could finish up all right 79 Heather do you have any comments about Markham or more I think I skipped you on that oh that's okay um excuse me I didn't have any real strong feelings one way or another about those um I would say James Moore has a I'm a little bit torn because I believe their office is in Daytona so a little bit further away um but they do have local AIT so like Ron had mentioned Beach Indian tour than the beach but I do like that um but then Mar has a Tampa office but no pelis onit so I'm you know it's just the opposite you know one is potentially closer with um no pelis experience and then one's a little bit further away um both of those also mentioned that they're going to use share files um like you know a remote audit which leades me believe that they're not going to be physically there which is fine um but no I didn't have strong feelings about either one all righty my comments about Markham are similar and that just uh not a not a real standout for me um for the qualifications I rated them at 35 I noted that they have a New York City headquarters which is fine and offices in Tampa Miami Fort Lauderdale and West Palm but it seemed as though their practice really is focused on East Coast as opposed to a familiary with our side of the state um on audit approach uh the um I was a little a little confused by that in the sense that they mentioned that they have a bot but it wasn't clear to me that what that function was or how they were going to be using that so for that reason I put 20 well I put 335 hours with Bots you know how yeah with with the exception of salt marsh it was the most hours they were going to put into the audit and then they're using Bots it didn't make any sense to me all right so what was your audit post number again Kim uh audit approach was 25 okay uh references I'm going to go with with 10 and the proposed fee I had it at six actually I'm going to lower that to five I got 75 all righty we we're making progress here salt marsh we kind of talked about it already I mean I mean they're who we had but um I at 35 for uh the qualifications main you're destined all remote you they wrote that remote I just to like that audit approach 25 um no calendar they did put the steps but you know I was shocked that they had the 47 75 hours um and I put them in a 10 for references just cuz we know them and um then I put them in as a one on the fee so all in 81 all right Mr Goldman I would go on salt Mar with 40 20 5 and zero Pig 65 pass you feel my pain barely [Music] I kind of feel the same way Mark does I felt insulted by their proposal uh qualifications 20 audit approach 20 response to references 10 and um f54 85 that's being generous that's a 55 right yeah wait a minute 20 40 50 55 you're right my bad I at Le SK was 65 uh for me uh I rated them 35 on qualifications uh they are our auditor so we would hope that they're qualified to be such um they're audit approach 20 because we haven't been satisfied with their approach uh references five because our we are our strongest reference for that one and I propose fee one 61 55 all righty jeez I I was generous then oh my gosh so our final respondent is Wells Wells so I gave them a 45 cuz they're in St p and as we talk you they just they really seem to lay out uh their audit um how they go about it who their experience their expertise they're in our backyard they're doing it with all the neighbors that we like him to be doing it with a approach I put him at a 30 um they gave the calendar dates you would be done here presented the council presented to gfo I gave him a 15 for the response again they had they they noted um gfo clients um and they had they had Legacy time with most of their clients that they gave his offered his referrals and then fee I gave him a seven so that gave all in a 97 all right aot okay Mr Goldman on Wells Houser Wells Houser 40 30 10 and seven 7 8087 87 87 okay Mr Hansen okay um bations 45 audit approach 30 references I gave him 15 and proposed fee uh 7 all righty uh for me uh I gave them 45 on the qualifications um St Pete is their only office which was I thought a great fact uh they have 11 in total staff one thing they have no women on staff which is a little concerning um and that that it looks as though the shotel might be a fatherson team and I don't know what kind of impact that has in terms of you know how everybody else in the firm feels how they get along and how assignments are dealt with so just I think something we need to look at but um I love their uh current Client List that includes seminal Oldsmar South Pasadena belir Bluffs and Readington Shores so they certainly know our area uh on the uh responses of references AIT approach AIT approach I gave them a 30 uh I like the fact that they will be on site Y and I want to make sure that that's okay with uh Heather but I I thought that was a very strong Factor as well as the fact that they're close to get here to do so uh on the responses I'll go with 15 on that one along with every everybody else and on the proposed fee uh it was they were I'll give them an eight on the Fe well can I can tell you that they do have women on staff they didn't list anybody on the audit team other than I think that they said staff account I think that a woman um and the Shel are wonderful people I mean Pete Shel is probably the nicest man I've ever known definitely wonderful to work with um and then mattle is the son and I know he's a good auditor because I trained him they will um they will be on site definitely um I to it's inconvenient hang on that was that was me I'll go over the uh yeah I was just signaling to Kyle since he's on his iPad hopefully he's got it all toled up instead of me doing it but but I I think um I kind of think from a continuity perspective at some point that'll retire and son will take over the business so I like it from that I kind of think you down the road that that could be an opportunity mhm I know I know we'll do an RFP long before that ever happens the other partner John Hower he's the um he would be the second partner reviewer on our job but he's the main partner that audell BL so you know he's also familiar with the area and the local audit as well very good well just when you talk to you your peers and what you see with the other cities I mean how does the fees rank I mean is I mean I know they gave us a fee any room to go back and say can you do for $1,000 doll less or is it worth it you get what you pay for at the end of the day so well with the attention at Salt March I thought that these were all very fair um we budgeted 35,000 for the this next year's audit um that's what I was kind of anticipating these coming back so I pleased that a lot of them were below that um but I think that it's fair I mean you see the amount of hours that they're anticipating spending on our job it's a lot of work there's a lot of documentation and and there's a lot too that we don't see you know in their proposals you can see that there's the planning and risk assessment evaluating internal controls and testing and reports like all that takes just so much time um I think that a lot of these firms will probably attend a lot of the same conferences they'll go they do a lot of the same trainings um but it does take quite a bit of time you know to on their side you know they have auditing standards that they have to document that they've done this and that and then going all the way back to the very beginning Kim you had asked about the single audit um we will probably never be subject to a single audit they just raised the threshold for that to a million doll which is if you get federal funds and spend over a million dollars in one year then you would be subject to a single audit so we have no um anticipation of ever being at least during this term of this AIT um we wouldn't be subject to that so I think that we can base our at least the cost considerations on their main price without that um single audit but the one thing I will say that I thought stood out on well and CH they were the only ones that mentioned that alternative report for the arpa which is not an issue for us anyways because we spent all of our arpa money but I thought that that was interesting that they're they are so familiar with this area and the municipalities and just the operations um to mention that um the other ones obviously will have to do Harper reporting as well but it kind of makes me think you know did they just take an rfu that they did for someone else and move it and replace some some other City's name with bell Beach well we've seen that before I did yeah for sure and I'm pleased to see that you guys saw the value of M and Chapel I mean they do I I am the most familiar with them obviously so I would be very happy with them as our Auditors I don't know how the your ranking added up I don't know if you have it I do um so I what I took we have of the uh the full members of the audit committee um we have five of six here so I did the average score of the five um well sorry we have four of the six here but we did have Rob reasing turn in his numbers prior to the meeting so I included hits so I have the average of the five what was Rob numbers um you want his totals at the bottom you had um they're on the sheet in front of you but they're um His Highest is actually oh I'm sorry I I didn't yeah that's in there okay good okay got it so if I go down the list um of the the average for total scores so csnl I have a total of 91.2 for James Moore and Company I have 88.8 for Markham LLP 84.8 for salt marsh Cleveland and Gund uh 68.4 and for Wells Hower and shatel Pa I have 94.2 so that was the high score average well those were my two pick I didn't do the ranking but I like Weller and chel and I like psnl as well those were the two that I was leing towards those were my two also my leading ones going in so do we need a motion to recommend proceeding with Wells Houser is that on the agenda is it do we do we make a motion to send it to city council no you guys decision yeah okay is your decision oh so we do the actual selection yes um do you think we should invite to in I think you recommend it you recommend it to the city council and then they make the final decision I don't think we need to go through the exercise of an interview I know to inter it's up to you guys I mean you don't I don't think so really huh especially if Heather knows them and they tested out I'm fine I I'll make a motion just that we recommend Wells Houser shotel as our future auditor would be my motion I'll second all righty well we we're uh efficient tonight so we have a motion and a second to recommend that Wells Hower and shotel serve as our new Auditors all in favor I any opposed motion carries one more call well I will say that the city council will have the option if they want to to then interview them um I think that would be up to their discretion but I think that your recommendation will carry a lot of weight with what they decide but they if you you know wanted to interview them you could do that and have them come and present and just meet you guys but sounds like we're all in favor of now is this for one year that's a threee with the two one-year extensions now I did notice like markam in their cover letter they said that they're proposing 3 years with two one-year extensions but they're pricing they didn't put the option yeah in there but um but these guys carried out their option through the full five years three year do you guys feel good about plus two oneyear options about um you make this recommendation but we'll have them come and represent themselves at the at the meeting you when they when they present the oh no when we when we uh recommend Council for approval yeah it's invite him it would be good for uh the partner just to make a few comments about I think it would be good for him just to say he we're St Pete Bas but just the winning yeah just the winning yes yeah that was not part of the motion we presented so is that something you want to add I mean I don't know if we got to I mean you can make a motion get on record

committee meeting minutes to be approved and it does have you as chair last year last year I was on the I would have approved look at I mean Jodie Shirley was on on a committee they're say we approved these already didn't we in the last a committee mebe probably not because this would have been the first audo committee since that so maybe Rene date on agenda April this is Wednesday July 12th huh it's almost been a year Jody Shirley city council member okay here's the minutes from our meeting last month we approve these wait yeah so you approve those that's audit on that one maybe they never

the July 1223 audit meeting minutes okay okay go ahead approv approved the July 12th yeah so these were already approved so it should have been signed already yeah I don't it's probably I don't know why I'll check that and get back okay yeah but we approved those at the last meeting so this one is today is there any um new business anything further for us to I guess the only thing I ask bu I guess we'll get a draft of the budget after you have the work session coming up and yes cuz then we'll get all the draft for all the council input from first workshop and then do can we discuss with with the members present want a good date at Le to start with what do you thinking well and that's that's the Finish advisor committee the audit selection committee right now yeah it's a separate committee oh so it's not the audit committee that looks at the budget it's the cz's advisory yes oh okay yeah so cuz Kim will get it when she on count yes okay got it so we could bypass that if it just doesn't make sense um go the standard way Rene sends out emails you just have what do you have an is it going to be like end of this month I'm you guys want typically do 5:00 and usually do some Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday um it our Workshop is Monday so anytime after that it could be next week or it could be I'm going to be out of town next week okay but the the following week I'm here okay how about for the rest of the month just as a sign note are you guys here for the I'm going to have to I my okay written calendar with all my travel stuff so set a date here for now and I'll look at it tonight I'll shoot you an email okay any we just have Rene send it out yeah we'll send it out but I'll just have a general idea I know he's here like the week of okay what is it the week of the 24th yeah PR are you talking about the advisory committee yeah just got I just want to get some input all right so um well that would Beth week of June can I say my two c sorry before you finish yeah um that draft that you'll see then that we prepared we won't have the updated adum numbers until like they give that to us the taxal values on July 1 so just keep that in mind when you go over that budget um we'll get more than we bu and so does that mean we get we get to call you and Kyle a nickname we call it one sand and the other one bag so we'll have the sandbag figure out Heather yes um how far has the estimated value been from the actual value in the past like couple years it doesn't fluctuate a lot but the budget that we prepared the first draft that's going to go in front of the Council for the first Workshop I we just kept the ad alarm at last year's budgeted amount because we didn't have any taxable estimated values yet um but we have since gotten the preliminary estimate and it's higher I mean your taxable values had gone up I want to say 10% again like the last two years we've had a 10% increase in taxle values that's a lot wow I well we live in Paradise but it didn't fluctuate between that preliminary six I say the um the uh Sheriff contract that's going up another 7% per. that makes sense you're going to have to start doing more and I'm going to send you an email about that too I almost hit a vehicle yesterday on 20th Street making a right turn parking too close to the intersection the wrong way yeah that's uh corner by 21st 21st I'm sorry terrible I got to go down 2st to get the mining because of the median on 22nd well that big twostory there on that corner there was somebody in the in the circular driveway doing irrigation work I got my blinker on and and I'm slowing down to make the turn and I go to make the turn and here's this vehicle staring me in the face within 20 ft parked the wrong way oh you know what that was all the guys replacing the meters that's what it was they have a fun it was who's ever replace all the water sub contractor water yeah they're all doing the the water meters cuz they did my reclaim meter so they they did my reclaim it was the reclaimed guys yesterday and today it was the the regular meter well further down the street there dad red house that's been vacated Anna's house we call it the crazy lady those people working on that parked on a wrong way on the street well come down bring it to the sheriff when he patrols if they're parked the wrong way to get a ticket not a warning this is getting over so on 22nd Street at the cuac past me at the far end not only do they they park in front of everybody's mailboxes or wherever they want but they park on the wrong side and and they line both sides of the street the garbage company now does a u-turn on Donado and backs all the way down the street over a block to get in so that they can get out after they're they're and the um the recycle people have to do the same thing and the post office guy he's he hasn't he can't put it in the pil box from his truck he has to stop get out and it's technically they don't if it's blocked they they don't have to get out of the vehicle right they can skip it yeah but the point of the whole thing is that it is illegal to park like that it is on wrong side of the street and facing the wrong way but the sheriff comes up and down the street and doesn't do anything about it Mark it's my point right I know we pay Buu books I know and if you if I you stop them and you tell him sometimes he looks at me like okay we pay his salary they work for us I know well those are the city those are the Cy's contractors not in that case that is no these are these are construction contractors on a new house talking different things three different sorry issues the ambulance couldn't get into I recommend we adjourn the meeting so that we can continue our side I think we have a motion to adjourn the meeting do we have a second who made the motion right Ron did I'll second very good you and me today all in favor I any oppose so we don't have to put that okay motion passes meeting closes at 6:05"
