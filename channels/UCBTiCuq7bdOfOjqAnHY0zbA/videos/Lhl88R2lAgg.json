    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is now 6 p.m and the august 1 22nd regular council meeting will come to order please rise and join join me one injury [Music] patty would you please call the roll council member frank banker president boyce council member leslie noterow here councilmember lloyd roberts council member jody shirley councilmember mike zabel vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor dave gattis interim city manager kyle riefler city attorney randy mora president thank you patty our first order of business is approval of the agenda do i have a motion to approve the agenda the motion made by judy shirley do i have a second second misleading tarot all in favor any opposed content is approved all right but before we move to citizen comments i'd like to bring everyone up to speed on what's happening in the town of bel air shore concerning their shade ordinance for some time now i've been pleading with mayor schmidt commissioner bloom and the commission to change the ordinance to allow single pole umbrellas at the very least in the access areas at their last meeting commissioner bloom motioned to allow forefoot umbrellas in the accesses and the motion passed i realized that four foot umbrellas are small but it's a start and the ordinance change has not yet been voted on i have already contacted commissioner bloom and stressed that eight-foot umbrellas would better serve our citizens i also told him that i plan to attend their next meeting to urge the commission to amend the ordinance allowing up to eight foot umbrellas this would allow two people to bring chairs and sit comfortably under an umbrella as you may or may not know changing an ordinance is a minimum of two meetings after deciding to do so and still requires the majority of the commission to agree to the change progress is slow but it is still progress and i remain optimistic concerning this matter i would also like to remind everyone that our beach bale air beach is open to the public and warmly welcome to umbrellas now we will hear citizen comments during this time you will be given three minutes to speak on any topic that is not already on the agenda when called on please go to the podium speak into the microphone and give us your name and address remember that you are addressing the council and not individuals if you'd like to speak please raise your hand but first i have a few people that have turned in carts that would like to speak starting first would be yoli rodero at 113 12th street good evening i am yoli gudero from 113 12th street and i am glad you started with the billiard ashore situation because that's what i would like to talk about i have my three minutes my husband pete with daryl's there he's given me his three minutes should i need it because i'm long-winded sometimes linda welch is also um i'd like to just give you a brief really quick history my husband and i bought this house 11 years ago and the one and only reason we bought here was that beach over there five houses from the axis and that's where that's the reason that many people buy here not bella beach not indian rocks the fact that you're so close to the axis and for two years now we have not been able to enjoy our beach even though it has been deeded to us rightfully for over 70 years and for this past summer we have definitely not been able to enjoy it my husband is the one that received the citation a citation that requires him to attend to appear in criminal court to be arraigned and prosecuted for having an umbrella on the beach now that is absurd absurd and a waste of everyone and all resources available but that's what we're finding now i'd like to just suggest to this council we've been here before we've talked about this issue two kind of avenues that we can perceive up to now this council and the city has proceeded on ignoring the problem staying out of the problem as the resolution that you that was passed some time ago baylor beach is not involved in this lawsuit butler beach is not involved in anything we made it to the beach and that has been on in the books for quite a while and it i would like to point out that this doesn't really work because behind the scenes things have been happening that interfere with our lawsuit i am an intervener in this lawsuit and i appreciate the comments from the from the bench saying that they've spoken to the failure shore meetings about possible settlement settlement comes from our lawsuit it doesn't come from this board and i personally resent your meddling into our lawsuit muddling the waters suggesting that they allow a forefoot stick umbrella that does not do anything and not keeping and keeping in mind or maybe not keeping in mind that food is banned bicycles are banned so it isn't just an umbrella there are more issues involved here fixing just an umbrella doesn't work um also i found out that baylor short is anticipating keeping their citation books right here in bellaire beach city hall putting them here because there's a deputy office or something here and i find that outrageous that we will be storing the very method by which they use to harass our citizens also this is going to impact property values already it's impacting i know some people who bought homes and are angry that no one told them there's a ban on the umbrella also in impact tourism this is the only beach that we can find in the entire state of florida that doesn't allow umbrellas and all for what reason so that belly short residents many who have been are there shorter than i have been here can have a 24 7 unobstructed view of the ocean well they're not entitled to that they have their land their rights to the stand part after their house but unobstructed view is not one of their rights and they should not and that's the only reason go through your minutes you will see but i'd like to suggest an alternate plan i like to ask all of you to stand up and fight back to support the citizens of this community we are what twelve 1600 strong and there will be sixty i ask you to please support us in fighting the this uh ban um we know that i a unprotected sun is a health hazard it has been declared a carcinogen by the world health organization excuse me one second uh patty i cannot see the cloth can you tell me how many minutes it's been including mr waderos she still has one minute and 15 seconds is that my original three minutes included your original three and i've added time for when we're discussing it so i'm sorry to interrupt you please continue well you're gonna add me some more minutes right you'll have a total of six actually a little over is that okay and you recently received a flyer from the ems saying how july is heat advisory month or something like that and how to uh protect yourself that advisory what's the number one thing on that advisory an umbrella number two is chloe then sunglasses and a hat number four sunscreen umbrellas number one baylor sure commissioners and major have stated algebras that they have had skin cancer and therefore they don't go in the sun but recently one of the commissioners had a party and he had three umbrellas over his pool to protect his grandchildren we want to protect our grandchildren lupus how many more minutes please approximately 15 to 20 seconds okay is this for my original three minutes i have nine minutes total oh no i i only heard you say mr rodero's mr rider and linda welch and i've already lost maybe 30 seconds from there no no i'm adding that on each time so additional three mare for the third person yes yes continue okay recently we declared this council may i think it is lupus awareness month are you aware what lupus does and what happens to lupus patients when they go into the sun they don't get a sun tan they have severe allergic reactions one of our intermediaries is a lupus patient so on one hand you support lupus and on the other hand you support a broadband by not doing anything for it i just want to let you know that i go to every single belly sure meeting and for two the past two meetings they're planning a nice surprise for you it may not be a surprise maybe to some of you but they're planning to bill you for all of your legal fees for the lawsuit they believe you are responsible per the inner local for their legal fees and that's coming they've said it more than once so i'm going to end by just saying you may not be supporting the lawsuit but you may end up paying for it in the end i ask that you rethink your position thank you [Applause] thank you very much and i will uh remind you that we are in a formal meeting and i will ask nicely for you to refrain from the cheering and clapping thank you very much richard hagerty i'll uh i'll start the clock here because i'm going to be off to six times while we're worried about the clock so start uh richard hagerty uh 9th street so ironically enough it's my wife who has lupus and i think most of my neighbors know my story 30 years in the army i won't go down that road again took a job after i retired from the military so i could afford to live near the beach on the beach access the beach safely and happily only to come to find out uh several months after my wife and i moved here that uh we really weren't allowed to enjoy the beach the way any other person in florida and probably most of the united states does with common sense things like shade um among other things i want to talk about my wife though for a few minutes this morning or today and not me so uh lost her mother to cancer very young as a teenager moved in with her father in germany he was also in the military took most of the brunt of raising her siblings we met shortly after flight school got married we've been together almost 28 years she's been through a lot for combat deployments raising our children a lot of other things it was her dream to move to the beach also several years ago probably seven eight nine years ago she was diagnosed with lupus and in addition to allergies organ swelling joint pain lesions and other things on top of just all the common sense things that we know comes from increased sun exposure now i'm sure many people in the audience maybe most of the people in bel air shore their response is probably just staying inside we don't care that's not our problem but that really isn't how people like to live their life not when there's common sense ways where you can do both you can go and enjoy the beach as well as take care of your health so we talked about this a lot i know promises were made during the campaign by then candidate goddess i even actually sent about a page email back during one of the emails that came out promising that we were going to get right on top of it that diplomacy was the way ahead i outlined several concerns and i think a very professional manner they're right here if anybody would like to read them and asking so how can you how can you assure us you're going to get this result how can you guarantee it's not going to cost us money how are you going to get around the lawsuit because in all of our minds and my wife's an intervener that really is our only hope because the council doesn't seem to be supporting its own citizens and there was no answer i got i got back simply in response thanks that's it and i thought to myself oh no another politician over promising and under delivery now here we are five months four months past the election and we've really seen no movement i guess four foot umbrellas which is that i guess if we laid on the ground and all huddled underneath them um i guess maybe that is a partial solution but it's not one that we really think works so i implore the council to stand up and fight for your citizens this is common sense this isn't a ridiculous sign or anything else it's common sense and it's our health and it's what we pay for and is what we elected you for three minutes thank you thank you very much [Applause] next up is baby dwyer okay i'm going to give my hands j.c enfield greetings mayor council and everybody else i'm not going to talk about an umbrella i think i just walked into hornet's nest but i came here on my own behest to complement paul moreno for his service to the city of bellar beach in the many years that he served i know as chairman of many committees that i've served on for the last 20 some years being a resident of the city that paul helped me and many on my committees and this man deserves the congressional matter of valor for putting up with what he put up with the man deserves a round of anything we can think of good job paul marino from the citizens of bel air beach thank you very much paul [Applause] again i will remind you to refrain from the applause next up is uh joseph manto mr manzo you have nine minutes i think there's somebody wants to give me three more here i got two people i could have 15 but 12 got that rick give me [Music] i'm sorry you can only do 12 minutes right that's what that'll be fine we'll do 12 minutes ready yes sir again honorable mayor council members of bellerin beach my name is joseph manzo former mayor and plaintiff and manzo b bellershore you know who i am you know where i live for two years we have been fighting this battle and sometimes it feels like i've been fighting it by myself with 48 courageous interveners behind me that's wrong that's why we're here tonight we're here tonight to set the record straight abc news is here tampa times is here we've been with cbs we've been with fox i have all their phone numbers there's no more lying there's no more given information that's incorrect to anyone because when information that comes out that's wrong i go right to them and i send it on that's the new world order now okay people are coming around to the idea that little children frank bancard's grandchild was thrown out onto the sand on the same day that council member stephen bloom was under a tent drinking beer out of a glass bottle that's three violations while his granddaughter got exposed to deadly ultraviolet rays it's unacceptable and i'm the one who put my name on the line and i paid for it personally i paid for it politically and i don't care for anybody who thinks that the election results is going to silence me you're incorrect let's go back down memory road and take a little picture of how this all started another beach didn't bring this on and i didn't bring this on no one even had the decency to come to us as a council and tell us that we were having that they were having problems at feller short in may and june of 2020 they had the meetings to pass the shade ordinance the first of its kind as far as i can see in the entire country i've looked far and wide and i can't find any place that bans shade another short date some of the reasons given so people won't set up shop and my favorite quote which appears in every legal document i make stephen blue make it the ordinance as tough as you can and maybe they'll go someplace else i'm they so are the 48 people behind me where are they and so are your citizens that you are supposed to be watching out for you know you have a strategic plan we worship it like it came down from moses himself it's the strategic plan it's what governs your city and the first thing in that strategic plan the first thing is safety of the citizens and what have you done there's one person on this council has done something frank banggard and frank didn't come to this council supporting this this uh lawsuit in fact he ran against it but when frank saw what i was doing and the 48 interveners were doing and his grandchild was hurt by being thrown out into the sun changed his mind i'm asking you to change your mind put your politics behind you it's time to get in line behind us and help us what can you do how about first off fred riley sent a letter fred riley is here tonight thank god and fred riley sent a letter telling bellar short all their ordinances that they were violating i will quote bella sure because i hear the tape of every meeting they said that letter that you sent isn't worthy of a response really you're violating your own ordinances by the way that was a big topic of my depositions with them they violated you know what what other people said but we just made the ordinances for the other people it reminded me of leona helensley when she said little people pay taxes that would have been the same guy who was drinking beer under the tent that day it's for the other people we have a constitution in the state of florida you know that ceremony when you rose your hand raised your hand and you swore allegiance to it and protect protect it i just wrote a legal brief on behalf of pedro ridero and in that legal brief it explains how this violates three portions of the florida constitution i'm seeking to overturn their ban it gaddis went and spoke at the reading that's wonderful but he doesn't speak for us as jolie rodero said i speak for me on this lawsuit it's manzo be better sure that's not what i'm seeking i'm not seeking a four foot umbrella by the way it's not four foot high as the colonel said it's four foot wide it's a golf umbrella guys in fact i measured my golf umbrella and it was 49 inches so i'd be violated in violation by one inch 49 inches enough to put on the seventh green not enough to protect your family it's ridiculous that my grandchildren who are coming here can't have an oreo cookie on the beach but they can't protect themselves from sun but i may have to take them up to clear water so that they can enjoy a beach despite the fact that i spent hundreds of thousands of my money to live across the street from the beach why what what's this great love for bellar shore i want you to hear what your mayor sent to bellar shore on may 17th it's short it's 30 uh seconds if we can get these uh these uh quality traders under control uh maybe uh between what you and uh joseph manzo are working on and uh and possibly these changes maybe we can get back to something where we have a single called umbrellas and then we can connect to a chair or status around and get not giant canopies but just something that's not so invasive and not such an isolated community we love your community we think that it's uh it's a treasure for all of us we love your community i don't love your community i don't love that community at all they're exposing us to deadly carcinogenic uv rays from the sun while they themselves protect themselves because you know why they've had skin cancer steve blue and robert schmidt admitted that to me before dave gaddis did this little speech saying that we'd be satisfied with a single poll umbrella i had lunch with robert schmidt we were had two months of negotiations i had a nine point settlement for them that went down the drain so no problem i'll take it to court we're going to court this thursday we're going to get this thing overturned and then friday we have the case management meeting on manzo v beller short this is unconstitutional you swore to uphold the constitution it's easy to be popular when you say yes we have 30 years of mayors before me that said yes to bel air yes yes yes and you lost the gates they put gates up you lost food you lost bicycles and then umbrellas and finally someone stood up not you me it's time to stand up and say no write a letter back to them and tell them do a resolution you know how to do one do a resolution and tell them that you are disgusted and you demand that they repeal this ordinance talk to your people at the big c and the mayor's council and every place else you can talk to your elected officials you know how to reach them some of you had some nice support when you ran for election you know how to reach these people call them tell them you want legislative support get behind the people of bel air beach you work for bellar beach that sign behind you says beller beach you love bellar beach you don't love bella or shore we've tried spreading the love for years and you know what two weeks after mayor gattis went to bellaire shore a memorial day the police came out and harassed everyone on 12th street i know i was there they also harassed the african-american couple next to us they got the written warning nobody else got a written warning what's that all about two weeks later pedro rodero from cuba gets the first summons what's that all about hey joe didn't tell you or his wife didn't tell you pedro came here from cuba on operation peter pan that's when the little children were separated from their parents and came to the united states to get away from the oppressive regime of castro and what's he come to a town of 58 people that takes away his beach rights and his constitutional rights we have deeded rights we have constitutional rights if you want to know the law go on to the public site the uh the um city the clout the clerks of pinellas county type in pedro rodero you'll find my motion to dismiss you'll find a 20 page brief you won't find it on next door you won't find it in the chit chat you will find it in the people that are non-lawyers you'll find 20 pages of cited legal information that's what you stand on that's why it's illegal it's time to stand up and represent your people it's time to stand up and protect this constitution lead follow or get out of the way please don't get in my way in my lawsuit i don't need your legal help but the citizens of this city could use your support time to not be popular and do what has to be done tell them you don't like their law you don't love them you don't even like them you want the law changed thank you thank you all right do we have anyone that would like to speak that did not turn in a card yes sir rudy davis 612 eli avenue i would just remind everyone that mr manto lost the last election he only achieved 23 of the vote that opposed as lawsuits his manner 77 percent of the bank baller beach residents voted for a calm demeanor on council discussions not lawsuits with fellaini shore the reason for the law of delay is the lawsuit the fact that they can't talk anymore to us because they're being sued had that not happened the lawsuit went away we could have had these discussions like the mayor is having now it's step by step making some progress thank you thank you yes hi my name is david keith i live at 109 harbor drive i would like to thank all of you for what you do um and i have walked the beach for almost 20 years until i had health issues i had encountered many people involved shores in numerous times i do the beach conservation the children rescue and the jordan rescue and things so i had direct contact with them it got difficult in the beach um there are many different times that people would put up the big square tents and they leave them there for the entire week when they were here um i would deal with it because they'd leave it overnight and they'd be in my not my turtleness but the turtleness and the uh birds would be trapped in the different things and i understand um the negativity that beller had i had one of the older ladies that i helped remember having sex under sea wall i found all kinds of horrible things this would be settled if it wouldn't be the animosity i talked to them people in the council out there and i agree with you um mayor gaddis they want at least a seven foot umbrella that that's going to happen if it wasn't for the lawsuit it would be there anyway thank you for what you guys do thank you other citizens yes jim van scoy 7th street beach first of all at any given time and had what has occurred was nourishment reached out to their attorneys and got permission to have a private one-on-one conversation with former mayor manson so at any given time this could be handled and as far as people were saying drop the suit start the negotiations if we had dropped the lawsuit there would have not been any discussions and the lawsuit couldn't have been pursued at any time so people need to understand that as well he went through and he stuck his nose out his neck out everything to to help the citizens of this city they were doing nothing they were given a two-week notice to respond then they didn't respond and they were given almost two months to square this away before the suit was filed the fact of the matter is they've been given ample time to try to work through this settlement negotiations have not taken place before before let's make this clear the depositions were taken of their mayor and vice mayor and it was the sworn testimony so all the lies all the backroom stuff that has gone on is just that lies second of all if we do not win this case it's not just for our city it's other cities around the state of florida and it also has to do with protecting the rivers the lakes having umbrellas do you not think that they will address this and use this to ban them around those places as well thank you thank you anyone else yes kim young 108 first street um i'm not here all the time but i'm here a lot and i just want to say i have been so happy since march that i could finally sit back and appreciate my property this talking to many neighbors a lot of whom are not overly involved we do appreciate the city councils representing us and working with fellow shores you know i like to go with the idea that sometimes you get more flies with honey than vinegar as an attorney i will tell you that my first order is always to try to work out things with the other side we have a city attorney that we pay to look into these things for the city so i just want to say i really appreciate the calm that we've had for a little while and i appreciate everything the city council and anybody in the city has done to help the residents and i fully firmly believe that the city council represents us as citizens of elder beach thank you thank you yes hi my name is helen i live on spruce i do not understand what was so rowdy where we live i've been here for five years nothing has been routing our our rights were taken away that's the only difference in this city that's been going on besides all the other things that were taken from us um miss keith has been doing cleanup for beaches maybe she's confusing indian rock's beach with bel air beach on her cleanups that's usually where the tents get left never seen a tent get left on bellar beach but there's been nothing that's been done to help my family and i go to the beach in a safe manner in these past two years you promised that you would come in here and help us get our umbrellas back nothing has been done it's you're in three months it should have been a quick turnaround regardless of the the lawsuit that mr manzo has going this should have been something that you said to bellar shores our citizens cannot go to the beach without an umbrella regardless of mr manto's lawsuit it has nothing to do with him has to do with your duties as our elected officials to protect us that's all thank you anyone else nope all right move on to item number mr mayor yes i'd like to interject here uh since you opened the door for uh before citizens comments about this subject mr banker i only made an opening statement and it is not open for discussion it is not i believe wonderful i mentioned you all robert school is worse since you opened the door and brought this to the attention of the citizens beforehand above a comment and then went right to the burner i had the right to speak yes point of order has been called i'm going to go to uh city attorney maura for a uh an opinion on this expounding again the parliamentary procedure is not codified law and statute or otherwise or in case though i would advise that the presiding officer introducing the topic does not by itself somehow create an automatic opening of the door recognize the recognition of members to speak is at the discretion of the presiding officer in the meeting there's nothing in your rules as a procedure that to my knowledge specifically addresses this so i would defer to the judgment of the presiding officer thank you very much so the point of order stands now we will move on to item number three which is the law enforcement report please come up state your name and let's have it good evening parent council i'm sergeant mike with boss county sheriff's office before me tonight i have for you the 2022 report for the month of june on the first page of that report the ucr property and person crimes report shows that there were three assaults one burglary and two large snakes the second page of the report is the arrest report there were seven people arrested during the month of june 2022 on nine different charges the third report shows the deputy activity there were 862 events resulting in 959 uh deputy responses in your city during the month of june 2022 and finally the last page of the report there are no crashes during the month of june 2022 [Music] and there were a total of 167 combination of citations and warnings issued in the city during the month of june thank you any questions from the council i have a couple questions regarding the um assaults and burglaries were those um well first let's talk about the assaults were those presidents were they people passing through the city what was a little more background on that two of the assaults and of course when they say assaults on that report that's assaulting batteries there was one domestic battery in the city last month that was a resident there was another resident on 21st street that was arrested for an assault and then the last one were two different construction workers at a home construction site one subject any other questions uh it's rare if we see a stalking a stalking complaint or a violation rather give us any information on that that's isolated incident with that one person has a long record with with the city and the neighbors in that neighborhood stockings happen where if i continually harass you or do something else and i keep seeing you personally to some sort of crime that you go into a stalking charge all right anything else thank you very much all right now we're on to code enforcement goody mayor city council staff uh steve potter for the record um this is my first appearance in the last two months i had some time off that i had to take and mara i want to thank you for giving me that fortitude take that time off and not be able to be here uh in the last uh 30 so days we've um still working on a lot of the violations within the city itself whether it's landscaping or different types of uh grass problems in certain lots we are working on that i'm working with that with kyle one of the biggest things we've got was i got a call of a gentleman that was going around one friday evening soliciting to do electrical work i spoke to one of the residents between first and second on harbor drive and they informed me that this man had been coming around i did some research on it come to find out he wasn't licensed he wasn't insured he was not a contractor i worked with the public or the ppclb the licensing bureau found out that this gentleman came from colorado in doing some research i spoke to five different residences on on 1st street told me that they did get approached by this man the licensing bureau is now actively going after him he's going to receive five different citations for soliciting work not being licensed and he's not a contractor he didn't give a name of the gentleman that he was working for out of brooksville florida i spoke to him come to find out yeah he applied for a job but his job or this gentleman actually does a lot of business work doesn't do any residential so he did send him a letter of cease and desist the information was forwarded to kyle and the city's also going to be sending me a letter saying basically you can't solicit it within the city limits uh and to stay out and i encourage anybody who's been approached by this gentleman you give me a call or come by here at city hall and i'd be more than happy to take care of it other than that everything else is still going flow our little situation on 22nd with the boat i did check with our marine unit that boat is registered through the coast guard and as they can tell currently he is not doing any commercial work it's just a gentleman that owns that boat and he takes friends out on it so we're still going to work on that they're going to keep an eye on on that situation for me but other than everything else is going well and i'll stand for any questions thank you council council yes frank baker uh thank you for your service first um just got a quick question for you the question brought up to me um what is the process you go on on a residence property job site and find out uh the contractors and neither his license just recently expired or didn't get the permit in hand and they're installing in an ac air conditioning unit jobs primarily almost done and it's in the months of like june through october okay what if i don't understand which question it is well what would you would you see would you where the job is ceased right away or would you let that job continue buying them appropriately um so the residents can get their ac unit back up well the way that works is and i believe i know what situation you're talking about um while on regular patrol i did see this truck it had removed the inside ac unit and the outside ac unit there were no markings on the truck itself that within itself is a violation of state statute so i went up to the residence spoke to the homeowner asked him about who's putting the air conditioner if i could speak to them gentlemen came out and i'll tell you was very pleasant he didn't understand why i was there thought it was not my position to do stuff like this so as i tried to explain to him the homeowner came out we talked i was also told it was an emergency install because they had no ac but the house had two separate ac units and under the county's regulations that doesn't require it's not considered an emergency repair so basically what i did do was contacted the building department they advised me that no permit was pulled the pinellas county licensing board actually took that investigation over uh the gentleman came in uh was the air conditioning company came in here either was the next day or day after and finally filed for the permit so basically what you're asking me if i see somebody working in a house vehicle is not marked i will get out just inquired to see what's going on i will tell you that the majority of the time even today when i was up on 17th street i caught somebody out there doing work on a pool wasn't licensed hadn't been licensed in pinellas county for four years and again i'm into education over enforcement in this case again my side of the investigation on 22nd street was nothing more than a warning but that information is turned over to the licensing bureau and uh they they they will cite somebody in this instance thank you any other questions from the council no all right thank you very much david thank you you all have a great evening thank you all right up next we have award presentations will former city attorneys paul moreno and friend riley please join me at the podium so all right all right here we go this first award is presented to paul marino and it says with sincere appreciation for your dedicated service to the

of issues we continue to handle public records requests and streamlining those as well as working through various contracts issues and code enforcement not a day goes by that kyle and i don't talk even for a few minutes so please know that we're working here and again i remain available to you folks as i work here at any time in the united states thank you mr moore all right now we are to the city manager's report mr riedler thank you mayor council first project we have is the follow-up on the 12th 13th and base three project um that's gonna be it when i wrote on the report is that we're we had a lead time of 16 weeks to receive the material i got good news today it looks like the material is going to be shipped august 22nd so we're back sort of what we thought originally on this project so given that playing a precon meeting tomorrow or sorry on wednesday and then looking just have the project started end of august beginning of september follow that up by the drainage project on 17th and 18th street good news is we've got the uh two streets the pipes on those streets cameron i had now the video in my possession i've sent it to the engineers for review um in consideration for when we designed this next project um we uh we stuck it in last week on uh wednesday and thursday with the tides it was tricky but we uh we're able to get it done in the evening um the golf ball of our underground project uh made a vice mayor gun and i have been meeting we've met a couple times already going through some some of the numbers laying out all the different options talking about funding options project plans and i've been gathering more and more information on our possibilities with that project we plan on presenting this to the council in a work session i'm assuming the uh third monday of august uh that we will have that for presentation um the 7th street renovation 7th street boat ramp project along with the 16th street seawall renovation that permits are filed with the county we're waiting for review uh there's a little bit of a lag time with the water navigation we're required to get a dredge and fill permit through the county for that project we're looking at we're open two weeks to have either comments or the permit itself get started on that the city hall seawall project um we talked about that in the last meeting i provided the council with the uh the plan for that seawall in the 2023 capital projects fund we are setting aside 30 000 for that project it may be enough it may be a little bit more but it's something to consider as far as getting that done to prevent the erosion of earth that's occurring over there the generator grant unfortunately i heard back from the state we did not achieve the benefit of cost ratio that was needed for the project itself i spoke with the state engineers they assured me that they worked through multiple scenarios i provided as much information as i could is using the the building as a not only a eoc but also as like a pod purpose of housing residents during emergency given the numbers we just weren't able to reach the bcr you need to at least hit a one-to-one ratio the highest that could be achieved is the .38 speaking with the state project manager typically generated projects cannot be reached unless they are a hospital or a uh like a fire department um i kind of wish i knew that going in did give some further insight into future grants but moving forward i attempted to contact the project manager and see if i could somehow this project was another i wasn't able to so i'm looking forward to the next grant cycle which is going to be this coming fall for future projects lastly i got the children's playground that unfortunately is on back order as well the equipment is set to be here in february i had the staff go out and patch the damaged slide to hold this over with uh to keep some kind of structure there where we won't pose a danger and we're looking to have that demolished in january prior to installing the playground thank you council any questions yes with respect to the emergency generator we had placed money into reserve for this budget cycle anticipating an answer on the grant for the emergency generator and when we put the money into reserve in this year's budget we anticipated the possibility of making a hard decision on whether or not we're going to move forward so i think we need to start thinking about that and what's the next step on this thing and whether or not we're going forward thank you other council members frank bankrupt yes uh city medic um is there any update on the 105 h3 tower i know the 15 days has now lapsed it was their apartment ever produced what's the next step there was no permit produced and it was on the code report to see on july 30th we sent a notice of hearing to that address and what date is thank you i have a question about that was there even an attempt made to obtain a permit no do not and then i have another question about the the pipe that i sent you a picture of on bay shore drive were you able to look into that that pipe has been cleaned um it did have some blockage from oysters we have that blasted out uh i need to get the camera in there at an optimal tie level to be able to see what we're looking at as far as that leakage i did tackle 17th 18th street first to get that done okay all right thank you very much any other questions if not and thank you and we will move right over to the city clerk's report ms gendry you have the floor thank you um i just did the processing after the citizens advisory committee and city council did all of their work so that just a list of the ongoing processes after each of their meetings and then there's a board of adjustment hearing coming and that is just preparation still in process and the last thing is the city of bellar beach hosted the barrier islands governmental council monthly meeting and that's all i have here and i would like to add to that annie did an excellent job i'm sure it had to have somehow you there's no way you could have done all that by yourself but it was incredible uh all of the big c mayors were very impressed they said we had a beautiful facility the view was great they were you knocked their socks off so nice job thank you very much patty with respect to the way email goes out for council members the we we had discussed at one time including the citizens advisory committee as carbon copy on those just because they are stakeholders in the leadership process and my question is is does that go out on a separate email or okay yes sir they have their own distribution group so yes i do send it separately okay i'm sorry august 11th six o'clock and uh and i second the job well done on the big seat it was

2022 city council meeting minutes approval of the june 23rd special council meeting minutes and approval of the june 30 2022 special accounting special council meeting minutes do i have a motion absolutely leslie nataro and do i have a second check lane gun uh all in favor any opposed all right the consent agenda passage all right we're up to regular agenda now this is item 12 an ordinance change city attorney maura would you please give the first reading happily mr mayor just give me a moment to get to that uh page of materials this is ordinance 2022-03 an ordinance of the city council of the city of bel air beach florida repealing in its entirety section 30-141 of the city code of ordinances pertaining to the gulf of mexico safety zone providing for the incorporation of recitals providing for administrative direction regarding removable removal of existing movies in the gulf of mexico providing for the resolution of conflicting code provisions and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance number 2022-03 by title only on first reading mr mayor thank you very much before we move into discussions do i have a motion uh i think you're going to have to actually okay uh motion to uh on ordinance uh 3141 city code ordinance that's ordinance number 22. [Music] to approve the ordinance do i have a second second all right um lincoln you had the floor yeah i just want to open this because i i want to make sure i have an accurate perception of what we're trying to do here and because leslie is in the condos and probably deals more with those people she's gonna have to help me along here my recollection is when all this discussion and debate started with their the buoy situation we were given basically an option of making the changes or taking them out that's my recollection of it so the next thing that happened is we had kind of a town hall meeting where people came in we had a public hearing essentially and people came in and gave us give us their inputs on how they thought the design of the bully should be laid out and we added sections lanes for boat access to the beach and there was some question about that however during that very first public hearing the the vast majority of people who got traction in that meeting were boat owners and they felt well if we're going to redesign the bush system we would like to have these lanes to come into the beach the next thing that happens is the word starts getting around with the condo residents and they have some concerns about the rulings and the depiction of the new layout for the buoys the third thing that happens is we go to the first public reading of the change ordinance that laid out the new buoy depiction on baylor beach and it had i believe three boat lanes there well there was some uh concern by the condo residents and they made that very apparent to us came to the knee and the next thing that happened is when we looked for a motion to change that ordinance it died because there was no motion for it no second they died so my the next thing that happens that we're up to item four we had this before us now which strikes out the depiction of the uh the safety the gulf of mexico safety zone and basically removes all of the buoys from baylor beach and i just want to make sure i understand that the concerns at the time when we discussed the layout was are we creating an opportunity for boats to start coming in and creating a nuisance on the beach because of those those boat access lanes and because we didn't we took that action we went right to that action and then the follow-on action was it wasn't it died now we're taking out all of the beliefs so my my concern is are we creating an unexpected consequence whereby you're taking out all of the movies and now it's just open season for any vote to come up on the beach in front of the condos there and i'm just i'm wondering am i reading this wrong or is it i believe i'm probably better positioned to respond to the member nataro so what you have are mutually exclusive policy positions right based on the responses we receive from fwc in the current state of the law in the federal and the florida administrative code the wake zones that we have that you had are not a permissible designation within your waterways based on the required criteria to be able to have them and so you were allowed to have you could have a vessel exclusion zone a swim area a safety zone as it's been historically called where no vessels would be allowed with some potentially with additional showing you could establish a vessels under manpower only or something kind of something like that or you could arrange the swim zones in particular areas and allow for carve outs as this as was ultimately proposed to you trying to balance the equities of the interest that administrative expressed to you as policy makers that ordinance that had a specific design that had been submitted to fwc to make sure they felt our ordinance aligned with what their with what the administrative code permitted uh was put to this council on july 5th failed your question about will there be unintended policy consequences there are forever unintended policy consequences for any decision that's you know just every drop leave circle every you know drop the notion these rebels there may be ripples for no pun intended in the waters here but i will tell you that once this once this once there was no will by the legislative body of this community to propose amend or discuss an arrangement that preserved buoys in any arrangement that said to us that there was that the inverse conclusion must be drawn when we informed fwc of the fact that the ordinance had not passed the proposed arrangement they said okay so what are you going to do about your code which i advise the manager was the very natural response to say well we don't have any intent to preserve this anymore they say great we'll take it out so that no policy maker in here comes in and says well this is on the box and so that is this is a cleaning it up to align with the implication of your policy decision to not advance discuss or amend the proposed arrangement with boobies the public out the public response that you heard was largely in opposition to the presence of those movies this simply memorializes that this is a discrete amendment removing one section the one section that establishes the safety zone by the way that nomenclature would have had to come out anyways it was safety zone was cut out in that proposal so my question is though is because there was a silence and the emotion died my question was that might have been the precipice for the unexpected consequence here and that is and if you if you back up and look at this indian rocks just face the exact same situation so what did they do well the status quo approach to this is you make it now and vote exclusion zone the boys are still there you're still providing safety to the swimmers on the beach and nothing's really changed i'm told they have a handsome and brilliant city attorney and i've conferred with him um i've confirmed that i'm familiar with what each jurisdiction and this is the joy of women right each jurisdiction can dictate what it desires that is how that community chose to respond this enactment uh proposed enactment before you reflects nearly a year of your correspondence back and forth with fwc in the dialogue happening at a staff level and at an attorney level on trying to find something to balance that particular equities and interests of this particular community and having seen a series of proposals involving movies be ultimately unsuccessful the message to from the policy makers is we're not interested in seeing this our residents haven't expressed to us some some strong desire for this such that we wish to advance this further and so if that is the case we cannot have we cannot continue to maintain the law of the books as it is i i do you would disservice if i leave void provisions within your code once i'm under the hood we fix what's there and so this is the fix it's to remove it sorry i just want to conclude you enjoy the legislative uh discretion should you at some later date choose to revisit that you may revisit that political will aside just procedurally you may revisit that but at this stage what we've brought for you is is to finalize those exchanges with fwc so we can say we are in compliance and here's how our code complies so i i certainly understand making the ordinance look like what we wanted the outcome to look like and i guess i'm questioning the outcome is that what we really want did we really think of it in those terms i could comment on that i can tell you what they didn't want and i i literally received dozens of emails phone calls and people coming up to me in the meetings and speaking with us during the breaks and i did not have not one single person said we must have these i want this fixed i never got that uh one time now there may be people out there that do want the buoys but i have not heard that all i have heard is there's no record of boat issues and i think you heard it probably the exact same thing that i did and as representatives of our community and i believe we have no choice but to respond to our constituents i'd like to give others the opportunity to speak that's all right a lot of the people who talked who spoke at the june 6th we were objecting to having the boat zones and the swim zones and that just just didn't work we've never had a problem that i know over there you know people will bring their boat in to pick up the grandkids you know but nobody comes in at warp speed or anything like that and so if we have to take if we can't have the buoys out the same you know out farther that say [Music] and that's what i heard in fact they were highly opposed to having they weren't ozones they were non-regulated zones is what they were and whenever lynn and kyle were working on this lynn specifically adam's label of his boat zones and it looked terrible it looked like calling all boats that was that's not that was not the intention that was not what we were looking for but they did realize that no matter where you put those open zones uh condo owners felt like they were being slighted and uh and not being treated fairly others i'd say about 50 of them spoke up and said well i don't like them at all i want them gone and if there's anything you can do to make them go away do it because we don't believe there's a crawl so that's that's what we've what we've been dealing with and my my response to that has been well now it's all about the entire beach is a boat zone um so that's that's where we are right now and that's why we have two readings so that we can think about it but today i have not had a single person come to me and say you need to stop this we need these movies i have not heard that and i see council member banker's hand is up so please mr banker yeah first of all i thought ordinances before they came on the agenda was supposed to be worked out at a work session am i incorrect on that yes your understanding is incorrect there's not a base requirement in the law or code that an ordinance be workshop before presenting so who directed you to come up with this awareness i guess i i received my direction from the city manager after conferring with him and fwc on communicating the failure of the amendment at the july 5 meeting the my advice has been we will likely need to repeal this the agency responded to say we would like to see this repeal without being aware of my advice and given that meeting of the minds and i i asked the manager if i could proceed with presenting something to the commission that would memorialize some action and here we sit well i believe this should have been addressed at a work session because we just had a bunch of residents come in about safety on the beaches and this is on the beaches um i don't know mr davis um if you don't get the same emails i get uh you see one today of a citizen uh complimenting our state area emphasizing bullies i think he sent the ball council i should see the number of emails about preserving the movies from that group belarus shores adam which we had an interlocal agreement for over 20 years that our former city manager took it on its own award without addressing council to abrogate that agreement furthermore never fulfilled the duties and the requirements for that permit and i pulled up irb's minutes this month and i didn't know if this was uh you mr moore or you had a twin but it says uh just reading off the minutes it says the city can have no buoys it would be an open season for all of us uh i think that clearly states and then you also say discourage removing all the ones just to paraphrase the minutes of july irv um so we have citizens that came here in june okay that were not residents i believe there was only two residents all more condo owners okay they weren't residents we've had residents emphasize safety we have a strategic plan which i think's a joke because we don't follow it um and the number one issue is safety but hey remove the buoys if you guys see fit but let the blood be on your hands and just snickering if somebody gets hurt or killed out there i mean because when this motion failed or the motion field for the ordinance for the swim zone vessel zone which six of you guys not me voting to bring it out of the workshop introduce it on the agenda not one emote not one of the main emotion to move forward and discuss it all right i've always stated that fwc is incorrect 327.46 we do comply with it i've contacted the attorney general's office about this today um i sent them a long long long letter with uh exhibits from aiden i believe i um and hey somebody gets hurt can make i can make sure that i fought for the safety of the people of belarus beach visitors of ballard beach residents of bella beach thank you city attorney or would you like to uh to comment on the validity of this statement about the fwc i would say that fwc is tasked with interpreting its ordinance and it's for administrative code i've talked with mr banker very briefly about the provisions that he has cited i i don't reach the same legal conclusion in terms of the defining terms and how they apply throughout the ordinance but my own subjective interpretation is not what is controlling here is controlled by the agency tasked with enforcing and administering this that that said excuse me that said uh this is what i am not a policymaker in this community i want to be very clear as i am newer to being your attorney and meeting your wonderful public and working with you folks i don't need policy here you folks do we put together a policy proposal that i think aligns more closely though not precisely word for word with what the member banker the the values member bankers proposing that did not succeed i can't will it to be so one way or the other i presented you an option and ultimately the majority of this body will dictate what this community looks like as the process should work and thank you for uh clarifying that i was not looking for an opinion on how to vote on the validity of this statement do we have any other council members yes lloyd roberts i was fortunate that a very nice citizen of belarus beach called me on the phone and asked if i would like to take a boat trip up and down the beach area starting in clearwater beach and going fairly far to the south so that was very beneficial to me so that i could get a firsthand view of all of the buoys that were existing out there today the type of language they had on the buoys also had an opportunity to see which areas of our beach actually currently had no buoys so that was kind of eye-opening one of those areas is belair shores for the most part i think the entire baylor shores area has no voice it may be one that would be debatable i live on 20th street so we access the 19th street parking area a lot and we use that beach area there because obviously if i chose to i could go 15 feet towards miller beach and i'm outside of the umbrella task but in all the times my wife and i and family and grandchildren have been out there i can't even tell you if i've ever seen a boat come up to the shore on baylor shores not that i'm actually looking for it but nothing caught my eye to where i said wow look at that boat there's like 20 people dancing on the beach and they dock their boat on the shore there may have been a boat there at one time or another i'm just telling you i i never recall seeing any i think the good news here as randy said earlier that if we do decide to remove all the buoys at any time in the future we would have the option of putting buoys in if we thought there was an issue out there i also understand that the condition of the buoys that we have out there now even if we had moved forward with the new ordinance almost all of those buoys when i was talking to the previous city manager he felt like those would have had to have been removed and we would have had to have acquired new in some time in bui future we decide to put louise back in for whatever reason that may be it's not like we lost money and somebody might say well we shouldn't have gotten rid of the buoys previously now we have to buy new ones my understanding is we would have probably had to buy new ones anyway so just wanted to pass that along thanks well should we show it just follow up on that lloyd the buoys we currently have are not in compliance with the current requirement with fwc so we have to do something one way or the other my position on the swim zone versus boat zone is now we created three large boat zones along our beach that encourage boaters to come in that was my concern um with the boat zone versus it and no one's going to be happy wherever they're at so it doesn't matter what condo you put them behind what beach access you put them behind no one's going to be satisfied because it does open up to now we've labeled this a boat zone and guess what that becomes it becomes the next sandbar for all the drunken teenagers and their parents boats to go up and anchor up and have parties it's good to create a nightmare so when we had this discussion with the residents um there was there were quite a few that were just in support of removing the buoys completely now i like you i go to clearwater beach quite a lot quite a bit and when you get up towards the north end of well north of the pier there are no buoys there's it's just swim boating whatever you want and i don't see an issue when you get up in your account easy people there's boats randomly anchored near the shore they're not up on the shore but um it seems to work it's working in other communities i don't know [Music] i'm not ideally i would see i would prefer to have nothing change but that's not an option so that's where we are at and why this is here in front of us we have to we have to do something to comply with fwc so we either have the boat swim zone or we have no goodies those are our choices uh let's go to the citizens would anyone like to speak on this topic yes jules chandler gosh that was loud um 3207 hibiscus drive west i rarely go to the beach when my granddaughter visits she likes to go to the beach but i have taken a boat down there but i i'm against boats coming to the shore i have a neighbor in the neighborhood who likes to take his boat takes it right under wants to take it on the shore [Music] go two blocks to his house let the dog out do whatever they have to do and then they get back on the boat but i can see people partying because we're so close to clearwater beach and there are a lot of um like jet skis and it's unfortunate that we would have to take out the buoys that we currently have and to have to put in new ones and that's an expense and i don't know what that expense is if you have that figure i just i agree with what frank said about keeping the residents happy you don't want to say well let's take the buoys out and see what happens all you need is that one one bad thing to happen i hate to see that because you have kids that sometimes even if they go out you know beyond the buoys i mean that's not to say this but you're doing that yourself but i would be i'm against i'm for having the buoys or and not letting the boats come in so i had made that clear the last time it was a lot of the condos i get it maybe it's an eyesore but i think the safety is is better than the eyesore in my opinion thank you other citizens yes jim van scoy is 7th street now i was at that meeting and it was just to promote and inform the citizens no discussions were made the council wasn't allowed to vote on anything at the time and since then there has not been any work session and the last time i checked the council was the city manager's loss they would relay what they wanted to the city manager for this to proceed without this council's knowledge i think is wrong on so many levels if there's no checks and balances and this is what has happened historically if there's no checks and balances then how can anything run efficiently okay i do agree that there was way too many zones and yes it would have attracted votes in to be a party thing i do agree with that okay but as far as eliminating i i just don't agree with that we have too many children that don't pay attention we were out a memorial and and we notice a parent not monitoring their child okay teenagers swim out to the sand bars okay if if we at least have those boots in place okay it is a safety zone i think that we need to try to find a workaround if i i believe that if we start tampering with this law okay i think it also can be just like the nightmare with the short-term rentals i think it can come back to bite us okay and i think we should steer away from it as much as possible and just put the citizens first okay i'm not against boats coming in a general area to pick up or whatever to enjoy it what i am against this is not having some kind of marker there okay for designating no wave zone caution that basically puts a flag out there and says hey there could be possible swimmers in this area thank you thank you other citizens yes michelle segment live on 12th street and i have to agree as far as the uh the buoys and the boat zones just to make it a lot safer for our family and kids to swim out there i've been out there for the past two weekends in both weekends i've seen boats on either side of the 12th street entrance that have gone off there and anchored off uh one closer to the clearwater that actually got so close to the beach it was it was stuck up there they only have people go out there and push it so it goes back to the umbrella situation if it's an eyesore we don't care we'd rather be safe on our beach thank you thank you anyone else yes sir jeff keith harbour god uh be clear about this um the buoys are only 19th street in north they don't have anything to do with beach at 12th street or 6th street or 28th avenue so just wanted to make that clear to everybody that's here thank you thank you anyone else nope let's go back to the council my table right now we do have buoys i don't know if anybody really checked into them and i know i did um for example up in clearwater that's a swim only area no boats permitted in there we're kind of unique uh you can actually drive i mean i don't know if you know this but you can drive a boat you can take a boat right up to the shore here at miller beach it's perfectly legal it's the speed at which you approach once you're within that it's basically you've got to cut the image you got to go to slow but boats are permitted in that area right now this let's throw that out there and about the city manager frankly that's showing initiative you're preparing work we don't have all the hours of the day but you went out there you took the initiative knowing that we're trying to work with other governmental agencies you prepared a response and he gave it to the council to review so i for one applaud you i applaud your work coordinating with the city attorney thank you very much that's the type of initiative we like to see and we'll expect from the new city manager and said that i would like at least at this point to understand fully my understanding is that once you remove the buoys that you are still you can still bring boats up here they're still swimmers in the water uh and you're only really limited by you know personal damage like if you come in recklessly and injure somebody obviously that's the same on the street that it is out there at the shore i like to kind of understand that a little bit further what happens when you remove the buoy um next and this is really for discussion we've seen a lot of discussion tonight and i propose really tabling this two at work session to have perhaps povc come in tell us exactly what happens when you remove a set of buoys you know are is there an expected speed limit within say 50 yards ashore 100 yards a short i don't know those are my comments did i hear a motion to table no i did not no you did not yes sir just a clarification did did any rods beach crack the code on this issue or i mean are we solely faced with a binary yes or no either take the bullies out or indeed rocks beach has not enacted anything yet because rock speech is in the process and they plan to workshop it as well though if this is the first it was presented in the last i think 60 days in their community that they've begun to address it but the their their currently proposed intended approach is to have the buoys line the entire beach and have that be a vessel under manpower or sail ruling area and so there would be no motor boats coming in full stop so my presence of a motor voting that is is would be a violation of its code subject to a citation yes we are at a binary mutually exclusive the choice of the boats nothing in this ordinance eliminates ordinary torque liability from negligent acts or wantonly reckless acts and people may have civil causes of action should things transpire in that regard but the no i will not suggest that any community certainly a community that hasn't enacted anything and yet has cracked any code it's just they're taking a different approach but for them there has to this point and again maybe it will manifest but it has not yet the the vocal opposition to the buoys as they presently exist in their community but my question is is it a viable option for us rather than remove all the buoys to replace the missing buoys and re-label the existing boys with this boat exclusion zone or this that is an option to you that's what was presented to you i would suggest to you that and then i had a conversation with one of you earlier this week where i said no proposal that comes to you is my name you have the ability as the policymakers to make and change policy so when there was no proposed discussion to let's do this but maybe change it maybe do one channel zero channels we'll slide the whole beach and make it there was no there was no will political will or i should say no demonstrable political will in those minutes to have that discussion then at that point again we are left with the reverse implication and again in an effort to make your code clean and compliant this is your option um if you wish to return to an option that has a lot of buoys and that operate in different for different purposes we can have that discussion again we were responding to what the apparent will of the body thank you okay are you saying we can make like the whole beach a swimsuit period you could do that as a matter of policy you could make the entire beach a swim area which would a swim area that is a vessel exclusion zone no boats no kayaks no nothing panel boards paddle boards no nothing that is an option in the long run i'm not taking an opinion on it i'm letting you know your options yes that is an option boy robert so somewhere along the way i thought i had heard that fwc would not allow that if we were mandated for lack of a better term to allow vote access no that's not true no what was what was said in the nuance is you cannot allow votes and then dictate on what terms those boats will operate so there's no way so well we're okay if they're just done like an abc manner is what you cannot you can't have no wake low wake zones those are very there's very specific administrative criteria for where those can be placed this beach is not one of those places and so your options are vessel exclusion or a series of vessel exclusions or vessels unregulated as the mayor pokemon earlier you can either regulate them or you can leave them unregulated which would allow for all uses this proposed ordinance would remove the movies that are present leaders strike the safety zone which you can't have as it's written we would have to change the nomenclature anyways that's what has been proposed to you it failed here we are frank baker yes um first of all about the 12th the woman that spoke about the 12th street access there is a buoy between around 16 to 17th street hence so boat coming north or south you see that buoy and they have to start varying out west rather than coming close to the shore if you remove the buoys i've had discussions and i can't see the back of the room here but the sheriff may still be around if you don't have any markers i've been told by the sheriffs we cannot enforce high-speed watercraft they can come in as close as they want because there's nothing to warn them otherwise again i believe 327.46 one a clearly says around launching or landing facility available for the use by the general boating public on waterways more than 300 feet in width or 300 feet of any boat rate is allowable for idle speed no weight buoys i went to dinner with the family a couple weeks ago down to saint pete's by my surprise these water taxis were pulling in to the shore letting people in and out i walked down to the beach oh final speed no wait boots i then contacted the fwc showing pictures of all this i got to reply back well we allow that on some areas i then said well went a little bit further and explained every part of 327.46 and five other statutes their reply was we don't believe our position is not compliance now irb has had a permit with the epa since 1996. 1999 fwc was created this in-app agency that's ordering us or bullying us okay should be taken to test maybe a joint city since our attorney is represents the other city we should take this fwc to court for cease and desist order because what they're asking us to do is to put a put people in harm's way should we remove the crosswalks with golf ball ward because some residents or some drivers do not of like when i cross the street or my resident or my fellow residents across the street i get some comments uh i won't make them here um but they're they're there for safety they're there so i can get across the street off boulevard safely does the car have to stop sure has to stop you remove the buoys you clearly say what the sheriff's department says you allow high-speed watercraft in there i am also reiterating with the city manager of irb said you can remove the buildings this is this is just bad behavior this should go back to the work session and we should tackle this problem for the safety of this community mr banker are you wanting to table this are you making a motion a table motion a table do i have a second second okay all in favor aye aye council member notaro no councilmember roberts no council member shirley aye council member stable aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess all right so it's five to two it's table we will deal with this in the next work session i'm not really sure what's going to happen with the fwc because we're on their radar heavily but we'll deal with this later all right item 13 consideration of appointment for an alternate member of the citizens advisory committee we have two two people who have stepped up one is dr brian g biller and the other is belinda livingstone [Music] before we get started do i have a motion jason okay great uh motion is made by jody shirley who made the second right okay um i know that dr dillard is not here uh however would anyone like to speak on his behalf yes sir i guess there were some current concerns previously raised about his residency or voting rights in the city or something i guess in the spirit of why we had this citizens advisory committee looking at his resume and his credentials i i think we would be very fortunate for anyone of his caliber his training and experience to come forward and agree to assist the city of miller b so i kind of want to set that aside i don't think that's a showstopper in the case of uh dr dillard here i i think we are also uh mr hayes stopped me in the foyer earlier and i guess he just resigned from the citizens advisory committee so things are in play here and i'm wondering if we want to take that into consideration now or just move forward as it is we haven't had time to discuss that well right now we're in the of an alternate um but it's this just happened yes sir is john hayes still here runs again can you can you validate uh what i just said i'm sorry all uh thank you mayor uh so the assistant advisor council we have one alternate currently so with mr haynes's resignation that person would rise uh typically on to the committee and then we've got these two new candidates as alternates okay so we you say we do have one okay all right so we would have two alternates okay okay uh well that being said we could just go ahead and vote on both tonight if that works for the council do you have a following uh no problem uh generally thank you very much and thank you for those comments would anyone else like to uh say anything about dr dillard man yes um i noticed on his application he's been a resident of belarus beach since may of 2022. he's lived here for three months which to me is a little a little too soon to be on the citizen's advisor yes please so uh appreciate that um mr taro i didn't comment i i would uh be in favor of both of these candidates just reading their resumes uh the extensive uh backgrounds that they have i think what we do we look at a variety of issues whether it could be an ordinance it could be a change to a code and we also are the audit committee um and so having the depth and breadth of these two candidates i think would be fine and i don't necessarily think i i like getting hooked into the city early so that's just my two cents i'm sorry i thought you were going to give us uh an update on his uh residence halls oh no no no i'm sorry i just i i just wanted to do that okay all right thank you any other comments on uh dr dillon no sir would there be a question about the uh the way the ballot is written says vote for up to one we will correct that whenever the time comes uh next is belinda livingstone is miss livingstone here in which you like to speak hello good evening thank you for having me this evening i would love to be a part of the committee my husband and i moved here in march of 21 we do own our home aware of full-time residents we moved here from san antonio texas my extensive background prior to moving here i was director of quality and risk management over an inpatient rehab hospital which i had oversight of the regulatory bodies including all the committees within that hospital so i do that extensive knowledge and background in committees i also serve on boards as well i was at the alamo chapter of the case management society of america for three years serving i'm also served on my hoa in san antonio thank you does any council members have a question for this letter yes great qualifications thank you i like the metrics talk to me for a second about risk management sure i know as managers you're always trying to mitigate and reduce risk but is it is it realistic to believe you can eliminate all risk you cannot eliminate all risk no so at some point it's a manager's responsibility to manage risk try to mitigate it as much as you can but at some point manager has to make a decision to accept some risk he has to make that decision on what's acceptable what's unacceptable that's correct i actually appreciate that you're very welcome other questions no questions just thank you for stepping up i appreciate it and i see you'll serve on any other board so yeah i like that thank you okay uh thank you very much mr livingston i appreciate it uh city attorney maura i am still having a little problem with this i thought that we voted you had to officially vote an alternate end to the regular position that's not my understanding of how that traditionally works i wasn't aware that that was a sensitive concern for this particular position but ordinarily when you have an alternate they serve on the committee in in the absence of a member they have full vested voting rights in the meeting and in most boards when a fully vested board member leaves an alternate becomes a fully vested number unless it's an elected body but elected bodies don't typically you don't typically have an alternate commissioner for you know when one of you is out so on subordinate boards like that it is very customary for an alternate to move up and then you continue to have alternates it creates a part of the ethos behind that is creating a pipeline of leadership and membership so you don't go from you know five to zero five to zero again again so that's the philosophical thought behind that but um i'll well what's your code is immediate as you continue to speak on it but i'm not aware of anything that mandates though we've been in a position like this before where we we had one that it was an alternate and we now had a full permanent position uh that was also available in other words we already have an alternate and they put their name and they had to go permanent and then we had to replace the the the alternate do you remember any of this because it seems like we've done this this way before you one second mr promised not not all in one night like they said mr hayes just gave me his resignation so we haven't had it all in one night and we have done it both ways um through different administrations so the way that your code reads it says vacancies caused in the membership of the citizens advisory committee for any reason shall be filled by appointment of the city council i would submit to you that that could be interpreted in either fashion you have appointed alternates to the citizens advisory committee who would then uh elevate or you could read it in a more narrow in a more narrow interpretation to say you have to be specifically appointed regardless of whether or not you're an alternate my reading in the spirit of preserving the functionality of the board would be the former not the latter but the latter is if you have been advised in that fashion that is a justifiable and reasonable interpretation thank you uh yeah just real quick i don't think it's a big deal but we did actually just do that with the parks and rec i don't know that's a different grouping where we had somebody from the parsonal rack turn in the resignation we had an alternate we also had another person who wanted to be involved with that committee so at that same night we voted to on both of those people one was the alternate one was a new person we ended up voting for the alternate to move into under the committee but it didn't have to happen that way and if this body wishes to proceed that way yeah and just just some corporate memory on this mr hayes is a perfect example he was healthy moved into the position and i think along the interpretation of the charter the tradition has been for the council to just do a vote i mean we kind of all understand we're getting to the same place but it needs some legitimacy to the process because they serve at the pleasure of the council and it just kind of legitimizes the process that's that's kind of what i was thinking that same line uh well to begin with we have uh now we have we're going to have two alternatives that we're going to have to vote in let's go to the citizens let's hear if anyone would like to speak about the two candidates we currently have and then we'll come back to the council to wrap this up anyone okay back to the council uh the only really the only uh comment that i have is um is this twice now that dr dillard has the last time he was sick he and his wife were sick and then this time he was called suddenly to washington dc so yes it is twice uh that's it i i didn't i didn't think i had my hand up okay all right well let's uh let's just go ahead and uh these two candidates um so it said the ballot that you have in front of you says vote for up to one well now it says vote for up to two i'd like for everyone just to scratch out one and procedurally just so i'm clear you had a member who was an alternate you have a vacancy are you folks voting to elevate them or were you comfortable with them automatically being elevated such that you're voting for two i just want to make sure i understand i'm comfortable with elevating them are you good with that ron everybody else let's take a quick vote on that all right uh do we have to do it by voice or are we okay with it either way is fine all right all in favor has now been elevated to the citizens advisory committee you now have two alternate vacancies and two candidates before you thank you for uh clearing the air on that all right so if you would cross out the one and write in two and uh you are not obligated to vote for both uh you can say no on both or pick one or whatever any combination you would like so thank you and council member bankerd are we going to have him hold up his just like we did last time i just did so council member banker voted for miss livingstone and that was your only vote correct that is correct thank you councilmember roberts voted for both councilmember notaro voted for a miss livingstone and no for dr dillard mayor goddess voted for both vice mayor gunn voted for both councilmember shirley voted for both and council member sable voted for both vote members are appointed as alternates to the citizens all right thank you so much for stepping up both candidates and i look forward to seeing what you can do all right we are on to item number 14. this is consideration of support of the big c election of the saint pete beach mayor allen johnson as the ford pinellas beach community's representative for a two-year term one of the big c representatives is elected to represent all of the municipalities with fort pinellas pinellas planning council and metropolitan planning organization before we do this do i have a motion judy shirley and i believe that was leslie all right joey shirley you have the floor dave i'm going to refer this to you because you're more well connected with okay well um what what happens is forward pinellas looks for or they are looking for one representative to to stand for all of us beach communities currently alan johnson is the president of the big city he is also has the largest community in the bc with the exception of clear water the council spoke and or had a discussion about it really no one wanted that job but alan stepped up and prior to that it was cookie kennedy and she did it for i believe 10 years so alan really wanted it and all of the big city members decided yes let's let's uh please represent us while we were discussing that i told him that one of the topics that i would like for him to discuss and to keep pushing is for an eventual new bridge at sandy something to alleviate our traffic and he said yes i know you've spoken about it many times and i heard about it from your prior mayor and we would like to see something done and i will do what i can to help you does that mean anything's going to happen maybe maybe not but i just wanted you to know that's the that was really the only dog i have in that fight because there's very little impact that fort pinellas has on bel air beach so any other questions any comments oh citizens oh back to the council okay i believe we can do this by a voice vote all in favor all right we're up to item 15. this is to authorize interim city manager to execute first amendment to the low uh the interlocal service agreement for planning and mapping services and or special project work with fort pinellas before we get beginning to uh do i have a motion lesson do i have a second okay joey shirley leslie um i will turn this over to calm mr reaper thank you mayor council this is to execute the first amendment for the original agreement which was signed with the ford pinellas for planning and services and special project work it allows for one four-year extension and everything else being the same so for your approval thank you any questions or comments let's see no hands uh let's go to the citizens [Applause] all right let's go back to the council uh with leslie nataro having the last word all right patty since this is an agreement we're doing let's go ahead and take a raw a roll call though councilmember banker yes councilmember notaro yes councilmember roberts yes councilmember shirley aye council members abel yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess hi so it passes unanimously mr reaper you are authorized to execute item 16. this is to authorize the interim city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services before we get started do i have a motion surely have a second second second by mike sable jimmy shirley you have the floor so um i've read through the scope of services i am in support of executing this agreement but i would like to and i know they have some um allowances for this but you know there's a fee for it but i would like to see our account at least once a year to kind of go over our finances the other thing i'd like to see added in here is that we have that we get the financial reports with every council meeting because we have not they've got behind and i think it needs to be added to the contract questionnaire again i would add on top of it we had these budget names and our city treasurer wasn't present and so we're asking questions of the sitting managers and i'll i'll get back to you and a lot of those questions could have been celebrated probably on the spot with the expertise of our same treasure yeah there were there were some great advantages to having someone here on site but i think that the council felt like she wasn't doing such a great job and so uh here here we are now and we're not getting updates the way we should for sure so i would i would like to see that also three percent pretty good but i would still would like to see something for him somebody do a report i would even go poorly instead of yearly i would like to see a full loan let's doing the city treasure report like we get the city clerk and the city manager report i will be open to that mr mayor yes um i'd also like this is addressing other contracts too that these contracts don't be presented until we finalize your budget that we can talk to i believe this and the sheriff to move their cycles uh into ours because i'm sure that every government around here tries to set the budget get their expectations and then is the possible move these two after completion of the budget thank you the only comment that i have on that mrs abel is that they generally don't know what they're going to charge that far in advance so it's very difficult to set a budget unless you know what you're about to be charged and let's just say that this was a 13 increase well then we would notice and start shopping around this at least gives us something that we can put into the budget we know it's firm and we're good for a year well close to it right so uh so that's my opinion okay thank you thank you um frank banker you have any comments no i do not mr mayor i thank you let's go to the citizens on this all right back to the council i'm with joey shirley having the last word mayor i just how do we this is um uh do you get the attorney involved in uh modifying the agreements and and what specifically are we going to have request are we going to do quarterly or twice a year i i don't i think quarterly they tend to just regurgitate the same thing yeah so it's just nice to have a body show up yeah i'm the one doing my experience with this particular vendor is if you requested that they show just for purposes of introduction they'd probably be amenable to that i don't think that they would need a contract amendment if you're going to start requiring presence at monthly meetings that's going to be the cost that people want to and i i can tell you almost to a certainty that that would likely change the cost of the contract though i don't know that for sure and i would have to communicate that if your request is yes enter this but ask that they come soon we can make that a thing if you want to make something um and and if you put use but the monthly reports to be submitted monthly if that's not already a contract term we can say it's been approved subject to an added item that you will submit a monthly report um for you know the prior prior month's business work for that may there may be some negotiation that will lead with i can tell you when working with the um external analysis the concern becomes well that that month isn't closed and audited yet where in may we're auditing march you know there might be some lag and we're not comfortable putting numbers out from the public sphere that haven't been fully audited so there may be some lag that way but if you wish for us to for me if you wish for if your direction to us is authorized and execute subject to a requirement that monthly reports be we can communicate that if that's a deal breaker we'll just have to come back well i'm wondering if if there's even a problem uh mr wiefler are you getting a monthly report at all i got a monthly report at this meeting okay so so my point is is do we really have a problem or are we just uh do we not have someone that's uh uh standing up and discussing it with us mom i don't have a mother report i didn't get ready okay that's what i'm saying is are we just not getting the information but you are the financial rate board yes i thought you were getting this um today okay so i remember last meeting we got two we were backtracked yeah we had three months we were on council and didn't receive anything for three months right okay you did get two last meeting i apologize was not being distributed i thought this was a handout together it's uh it's not just you it's this is not the first time this has happened where it just somehow gets dropped off and forgotten about we can communicate that in approving the contract i don't know if you need a contract term based on the indications of performance and discussion happening here okay i think it's perfectly reasonable to accept the report yes the agreement specifically says cpa will not be required to attend workshops or council meetings my recommendation would be to for the council to approve this and then we contact them and find out what it costs to have in-person visits where we can ask questions and do things like that and see if that's where we want to go forward i think that's reasonable perfect all right everybody in agreement yes i'm okay well because this is uh dealing with money i would you please call the roll council members able yes yes yes thank you council member shirley aye councilmember roberts yes councilmember notaro yes councilmember banker vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess yes so uh it's unanimous and uh mr riefler you are authorized to execute the extension thank you right now we move on to unfinished business does anyone have anything that they would like to bring can we maybe just discuss what we're going to have on the next workshop what kind of items i know we had a few that we threw out there and i don't know if anyone took notes of what we would it's uh it's been very entertaining at the least of the schedule that we've had we have we're going to have to have if rainey is able to work anything out with this guy we're going to have to bring him in and definitely have a work session immediately we're obviously going to be talking about buoys again sorry this hasn't gone away but it's we're on the fence about what to do so we that's another thing we need to bring up suggestions i would like to definitely review this the bullies during a work session and possibly having a run from that ec just to kind of explain what the actual vessel rules are we need to remove boys and be bad police what happens i was on a panel with the attorney who principally handled that she and i were speaking just this past thursday i will reach out to her and see if they're able to participate remotely or offer somebody who their staff is a lean staff of i think three attorneys for the state but i will um on this issue so i will see if they can offer that if not i will be versed in this thank you for offering to reach out though appreciate that and remind them that we are saying capable so they don't have to say thanks again kyle dave could you put the buoys on the next big c meeting agenda see what everybody's doing yes uh let's see yeah well it's uh it's three weeks out yeah about three weeks out but i will gladly just contact each one of the mayors and ask does it hurt the other unfinished business do we have another budget review right we do have one coming up we have this week we have we have a calendar with a set schedule i know on the calendar there's nothing before the regular council meeting in september okay we can certainly roll that back into the work session but uh i think we were very close yeah so i think the thing i was hoping to see was it compared to a current financial statement so we could see is there any excess revenues income you know money that could be it seems like the end of every budget cycle there's oh there's three hundred thousand dollars left over we're going to use it on this project well how do we miss all of that that's and we never know about it until lynn tells us at the end so i don't know how that mysteriously appears it's it's through vehicle expense no just kidding all right so you have placeholders that don't get spent and so i mean it would be nice to know those things right if we're over budgeting three hundred thousand dollars you need to know that so well and that's where i think that in the past there's always been a little wiggle room and i'm what i'm hoping is that as we move forward we can tighten it up a little bit and i mean because it always looks like we're doing great and we're saving money and but we definitely don't want to shoot ourselves right so again that will be important to have that from our cpa we have like a actual versus budget statement that we can look at when we go into the next budget meeting program yeah and i mean by line item if we could if maybe maybe we set a matrix to where it goes beyond a certain dollar value then these these big ticket items where suddenly we've got all this money and these these different boxes we would like to know why that is maybe by a value or possibly a percent of what was budgeted i would i would definitely be interested in say probably the top 15 of over-budgeted items that we just don't spend the money and suddenly we take that money and move it elsewhere because we're not really being fair and honest with our citizens there are some big ticket items we need to really think about this emergency generator we don't have a grant on that so the question is are we going to go ahead and pick that up in the next year we're obviously talking about the city manager and whether or not we need to test the proposed budget for that in the next work session kyle is going to present to us a recommendation on how to proceed or whether to combine phase one phase two and gulf boulevard so i mean there's some large ticket items here that are coming up and we need to discuss that before we take the final actions on the questions we also had a street lighting in mind we need to remember to review some of the outstanding code issues for the balances in the next session yes and that's something that i have been willing to bring up with you randy is that the temple bel-air is currently reviewing their entire code i believe that they got a quote to sweep the entire code ordinances and come back with fair legal changes or at least advise the council to do that i think it would be wise for us to get a quote like that where we just went through the whole thing and uh and started cleaning it up but i'd like to know what it cost and obviously it's a it's not it's it's not a huge ticket item but i'm sure it's in the 10s 30s or 40s or something like that um i i just think that there should be something we could do to start moving forward we've been sitting on the sign ordinance forever and it still has not moved mr mayor we'd be happy to do that for the benefit of paul president our firm also represents miller and my colleague danielle and other attorneys within our firm are performing that work so i have access to the persons who produce that estimate i'll speak with them and get an estimate for after looking at your code to see what that looks like i'd already been making a list of things that i wanted to prioritize one of the materials some of the materials you have before you include excuse me my time expenditures and invoices for the past month i will tell you that would most definitely excuse me be a special project beyond the retainer as we're sort of suggesting but as you can see the time that we've been dedicating while we based on past usage anticipated roughly 14 to 16 hours of attorney time a month we're averaging closer to 40 right now on the routine and that doesn't create a special charge for you that's all of the three thousand dollar rate and that's you know that business calculus we made i think over time we'll be able to flatten that number that that is just to say that while we have not yet approached that issue it is not for lack of attention to the issues in this community and i'm not saying you suggested that but i just want to make sure that's clear thank you and i'll just remind you and everyone else we sort of walked into a perfect storm okay let's move on to council comments this time let's start with a council member banker thank you mr mayor um guarding the beach umbrellas in the lawsuit um i just want to note a lot of citizens don't understand uh that they can review the dates back in july of 2020 when all the council is an agreement to attend belarus shores meeting not in a hostile way but just to try to relieve this unconstitutional ordinance that they create about four days before that um counseling the art form city manager said uh we're contacting belair shores informing them that a bunch of rebel rabble rouse which will be attending that beat hence uh only a few of council didn't show up with that being or attended that meeting but i want to emphasize that i ran in hopes [Music] that we can sit down work things out that has not been the case with belarus shores of this mission um the lawsuit was filed i believe by citizen in the end of september 29th or whatever like that a few months after that rav overhauser email went out clearly showing that bellair shorts had no intention of doing it and if that lawsuit wasn't filed in my opinion bellar shores would do nothing to remove that ordinance and the longer it went would have been harder to fight this unconstitutional act and good night to everyone thank you up next no comment all right uh lloyd roberts yeah um just a quick story and i will try to make this quick i shared i don't know a couple months ago one of my first stories with regards to a really great experience i had with a citizen couple here in velar beach i had another one when i was going through my campaign process and i really really hope uh the couple that are actually in the audience tonight don't mind me sharing these stories i think it's important um i turned down 12th street and i can tell you one of the things that bothered me the most when i was campaigning is when people would ask me which team were you on when i would knock on the door and i just didn't like that question i think it was sad that that was the state that our city was in so there was a house on 12th street and it had three signs in the yard and none of them were mine and none of them were from the so-called team that i was on so i knocked on the door anyway because i enjoy talking to people and um very nice gentleman came out i introduced myself kind of my quick pitch was running for city council if i'm fortunate enough to be elected is there anything i can focus on for you um that gentleman was pete and we stood there i know for at least an hour and i did get an opportunity to listen to his story from cuba which was fascinating to me and when i would come home at night my wife would ask me what how did it go and i said wow i just met like one of the coolest men i've ever talked to in my life and explained how wonderful it was and i had something to do when i was going to go back the next day and give pete some more information and through that conversation he said do you know who my wife is i said no actually i don't and he said well you may have seen her online um she goes by yoli i said well i have seen her name before we still continue to have a great conversation and i've spent time talking to yoli we've had great conversations we plan on going out and having breakfast one day to learn more about each other um but the whole purpose i'm telling this story is i know a lot of us campaign about um working through issues and and creating a better friendship area we have a small city like 1600 people i'm not naive enough to think that everybody in this city is going to get along but i do believe we can work harder to fix some of those relationships i've had people share with me that hey we were friends good friends with other people in this city you know three or four years ago now we don't talk that's got to be fixed somehow somebody's got to make the first step and sit down and talk and try to get it resolved and find out what the issues are if you were friends at one point in time i can't understand i mean i'm sure things have been said i've only been here three years there may have been some things said and done that people consider um very harsh i don't know all of the things that have transpired but i do know that if we don't sit down independently and talk to and even if it's just a few at a time you know we've got i don't pick a number 60 people that don't like each other anymore if a few at a time start working through there's got to be a way to fix that and that's the one of the bigger things i think we need to do in this city is to fix those challenges that we have out there and can be done thank you thank you mr roberts judy shirley i have nothing further thank you mike sure just wanted to tell you how refreshing it is to listen to the citizens uh actually very welcome listening to all the citizens their concerns you saw the council very thoughtfully listen and become engaged with the various stories throughout as we do at every meeting unlike uh previous terms where citizens were bullied they were demeaned they were caught with meetings lasting until 1am it's 8 30 here we listen to all the citizens respectfully we're taking it all on board and we still manage to complete the business of the people just wanted to point that out to the 77 percent of you who elected us one hell of a landslide so once again elections matter thank you and appreciate you coming up and come up to other city meetings as well thank you thank you mr zabel now vice mayor god i think one of the things i was on the hook for and i don't know if there's at the work session or good morning prior to that was to benchmark some financial or budget issues with some other municipalities in the area and just a quick overview and i can send out some hard copy or examples of this stuff later on but i mean i didn't have to look very far because in my estimation the city of largo does a really great job of budgeting that sort of thing so if you go in and you look at their proposed annual buddy for fiscal year 0.3 what you find is this huge 450 page document it's huge but if you scan through the table of contents very quickly what you find is that on page 23 of this 450 page document is the discussion and overview of the strategic plan so what i'm looking for are benchmarks we're looking for better ways of doing something somebody's already cracked a code on something and figured out how to do it the better way or validation that we're on the right track and that's what i i saw here is the strategic plan does the handshake with the capital improvement plan it does the handshake with the budget process it has a family of plans that we need to start paying attention to the other thing is a budget and break they have this really nice two-page budget in brief that basically breaks down for any person to quickly glance at their breakdown of the budget again intuitive comprehensible kind of tells you what the revenues are what the expenditures are and what's important to them where they're what they're saying for the priorities the second thing is the uh the capital improvements program proposed five-year capital improvement i stress that and this is the validation five-year program broken down by what are our revenues what are our expenditures what is the capital project lineup do we get the horse trade in here do we need to change priorities and once again they set up a matrix just like we've got with care of capital improvement plans to set priorities but that's where it boils down to the budget process because that's kind of the expansion joint in our budget process so i think we're on the right track and uh kyle's looking at it to a lot of this stuff he's doing a great job on that item next best practices one thing that i've never been comfortable with is coming to this council meeting and finding a stack of paper in front of the dais and the reason why is because we walk in here to do business and we hit the ground running things are moving at a very brisk clip there's a lot of debate going on people are trying to listen and we don't have time to take a document and sit down and glean the information that's trying to be presented and try to filter it and factor it into our thoughts and our debate so kind of what i'm proposing is that we need to start thinking about reducing it there's there's really no reason why we need to come in here and get bushwhacked by still sitting here do you mind if i make a comment on that right well let me make my point and then uh we can come back to that along the same lines is hey sometimes things change at the last minute and i i understand it that's that's that's the business we're in and we try to deal with it as best we can but to the maximum extent possible we need to try to get stuff out in a timely fashion so that we can look at it from the comfort of our armchairs at home and try to understand what's going on we shouldn't have to sit down to things and try to glean through it beforehand there are some concerns about that obviously things change at the last minute or we have last minute information that's a given but i don't think it's a satisfactory response that all the time that you're trying to shelter us from sunshine issues okay and if a council member tries to or is saddled with producing some some information and they want to get that out to the council for a review prior to a council meeting then we need to sit back and have some discussion about the validity of that and do risks involved with it we understand that there are possible risks some of that stuff can be making it and i'm sorry it puts you on the spot miss livingston because it this is kind of stuff that factors into this stuff we get advice and recommendations on perhaps what should or should not go into the package or how council members should communicate but it's understanding the risk if it's a low risk and we've mitigated it to the maximum extent possible educating all of the council members that you don't hit the reply all button that you don't respond to it and you read the the uh disclaimers at the bottom of a city clerk's email to say don't hit the reply button on this stuff or respond to it and take that at heart that's how we do business and other than that if if there is that possibility then the question is is it high risk are we going to end up in a lawsuit over this or is this really really low risk and possibilities of it happening are so remote that we're willing to take on those consequences so that's enough said on this paperwork one thing would be the attorney billing cycle which is this document here this is one of those things that we had tried to change the protocol of this to so that the city attorney billing cycle was such that it came in before the council meeting so that we had time to sit down and review these things because there's a lot of information in here that give us background on issues that are being taken place between the city manager and the city attorney what progress has been made in certain areas who's being contacted that sort of thing so it's not a concern about the building so much as it gives us insight as to the machinery of what's going on within the city and how business has been taken care of with respect to the building on this i think we need some sort of big picture to do with this thing because when we selected the city attorney one of the concerns we had was the building protocol which was which was better should we go with a retainer fee or should we break it down to a buy the billable power so that's something maybe we hear enough time okay speaking about the i guess the distribution of information i understand that there are times where it would be nice to receive this information in advance a good example as the city attorney's bill however there are other times where i don't think it's appropriate um you yourself have tried it to give us information at the last minute that could be interpreted as trying to sway and and change the council's mind or educate the council on something that they don't know about unfortunately you're you've been passing it off to patty and it's up to patty now to make a judgment call whether it's safe to send this out or not in my opinion i think if you're going to do that insist on doing that then you should just send it directly in carbon copy pay that way you did it she didn't do it you did in case there is someone calls the council out for violating the sunshine law nobody can stop one another from emailing each other but i certainly don't want it to fall on the city staff to make that judgment call of whether it's a sunshine violation or not and they're having to call the city attorney every time one of your emails comes in i i certainly appreciate that position for instances today and this is what kind of gave rise to this issue was because i sent out some information on on because of a data point hey give us give us some recommendations so late last night i sent it out and it's on the wire this morning it hasn't hit the wire so gee maybe there's a problem with the server i've experienced server problems where it's it's not distributed so i i send an email and say hey you know what's going on i'll send another copy and the response is basically i'm waiting on the answer to a question it's going to be a lot of hard copying it's on the dance and if the answer hadn't just been arranged by the city attorney for concurrence or whatever and the recommendation was let's proceed with it in this way that would have been the end of the conversation we could have just discussed it in a work session or something like that but i i think there is value in anybody if they want to send out objective information that's low risk of interpretation for a sunshine violation then by all means patty is our public records custodian and she is supposedly our our expert on sunshine infringement with the backup of the city attorney so i don't think it's it's a invalid request to say i want to communicate to the city clerk because if i've got it wrong and i've misinterpreted what i'm trying to accomplish here or i've missed something i i would like penny to say glenn i don't think that's a good idea and i suggest we run it by the city attorney and if the city attorney comes back and says yeah it's not that the risk is too high here let's let's not do it then that's fine but if if if i don't have that cover then at some point it's like communication is cut off we uh we we kind of touched on this in the first meeting and i asked for you to hold your comments until we got to this point um do you have anything you would like to add sure um i appreciate the opportunity i recognize that i'm speaking when it's functionally your folks turn so thank you i travel to state educating on sunshine law public records and ethics i take this very very much to heart i will give you legal advice i will on occasion tell you what prudence today to tell you that the law does not require xyz let me be explicitly clear it is not unto itself a sunshine law violation had member gun for example sent his one-page memo out to you this morning that is not by itself a sunshine law violation because a sunshine law violation occurs when there's a media in the minds the problem is the susceptibility or the potential for a violation should anybody reply all reply directly start a sidebar or otherwise about the issue especially where the matter is being sent out in the hours before publicly noticed meeting we can neutralize any potential effects by just having it at the meeting i recognize that that creates an inefficiency for you folks the policymakers and that's a frustration and a challenge but it's a frustration and a challenge that is baked into the florida statutes the problem that i see with a broad-based policy of or rather a subjective policy of let's take it case by case is one it creates a backlog because i was contacted by the clerk and manager this morning shortly after receiving it i was on other calls i called them as soon as i was first available which was not near was not within an hour or two of this member guns emails the second issue is what you remember about in your comments you said i think where it's low risk and you're just transmitting objective data as we've seen in our modern era of facts alternative facts and whatever other kind of fact you may find what's he put to one man is objective data is another man's op-ed and so trying to make some kind of blanket rule you run into this slippery slope where what to you seems sensible and measured to whatever robertson sensible measured and going down the line are all defined as different things and nobody considers themselves in the wrong when they act in general and so to avoid that harm i suggest that you not transmit things directly if you don't have to the other part is it eliminates this the susceptibility even if you have a very good defense to having to defend against that as you well some of you folks well know the time it takes to prove your defense and get a resolution on that can linger the other point that i wish to raise in in talking about this more broadly and i did have the opportunity to talk about this remember gun is something that i'm learning about the style of this particular body is this body tends to more than other bodies i've seen in a council manager form of government deputize individual members to pursue an issue go forth and do the research for us go and then report back ordinarily you report back to your peers about public meetings but you're wanting to give them everything before the meeting and then maybe somebody has a concern and now i'm telling you you know what don't transmit it just make it part of the meeting and that's tremendous and frustrating the way that tends to work in a council manager form of government in most communities is you say manager so-and-so you know mrs smith mr doe i would like you to go on this please work with member gun who may have specialized information on this or you know remember maura who teaches on ethics please talk to him but we would like the manager to synthesize this the manager to produce something for our consideration and the manager to distribute it and then you take out the sunshine law implications of that it's the manager communicating with staff they can take input they're not polling people not saying hey mike said this what do you have to say none of that just hey i've been asked to work closely with one council member in particular but i the manager will still be the repository of the conduit by which you receive this in a neutral fashion and avoid any sunshine modifications to me that's actually the better approach longer term and that may take some adjustment and some figuring out how we do that without having to create some kind of rigorous technical policy but that to me is where this is really where the challenge comes because then you put me your staff person uh who may have sage wisdom on the issue but feel uncomfortable ultimately making that call or me the advisor is the bad guy a constant naysayer and saying no i crave inefficiency never never communicate that's not really how i prefer to operate i recognize i don't go to meetings without agendas it's a waste of time right and if i don't have the agenda backing materials all the more i understand that inclination i'm just suggesting that the better approach would be though they are selling with many many things that you not to use the term you said mr gumby saddle your individual council members with that burden and that zeal to communicate and then have their hands spattered by the law or the advice of the council of the attorney and i just want to close by saying again i give you folks advice you are grown adults if you choose to ignore it or don't think it prudent under the circumstances or perhaps too cautious ultimately you make the decisions you wish to make i give you advice and it's for you folks at the council members of this community to determine how this community will function thank you very much other comments just just a couple things our plate is full i mean we're all struggling on this burglar meeting meeting and we can't seem to clear the agenda so my suggestions are all in the vein of time management and productivity managers manage risk that's what you're paying those big bucks in there for managing the risk and if that's that's the protocol we want to use i accept that we'll hardly for my own coverage i will continue to communicate through the city clerk because i want one last check or a sanity check or am i doing this right that i missed something so i'm sorry patty but i rely on your expertise and experience and if i have a communication with other council members no i'm not going to communicate directly with council members because i think that's that's setting yourself up for failure i will use all of the resources available to me and that includes a city clerk and a city attorney thank you very much i won't say anything else about this topic we're sort of as a sliding pass just because uh things that i've already discussed but that's it's it's all good conversation yes thank you patty for all your hard work thank you many thanks to uh to everyone who attended tonight i also like to thank those who watched at home very important that you stay informed and when possible get the information first hand with that being said i do have a motion to adjourn who should do a journey do i have a second second might say all in favor aye aye opposed goodnight everyone"
