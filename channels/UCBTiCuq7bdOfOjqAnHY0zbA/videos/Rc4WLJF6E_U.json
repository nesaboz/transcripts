    "transcript": "all right this is the budget work session for fiscal year 24 and 25 let's do the Pledge of Allegiance Al to the flag of the United States of America to the Republic for which stands Nation Rene would you please call the rooll council member Frank bankard pres council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Kim Shaw Elliot pres mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reefer here okay uh this is a work session so uh only really have one item and that is to discuss and review fiscal year 20242 budget uh I'm assuming that everyone has had a u oneon-one conversation with the city manager to discuss the budget um and uh you already have your concerns or uh or don't so I'm going to and the floor over to Mr Reaper and take it away thank you mayor so I'm going to just run through some of the things yes we did every one of the council members I met with oneon-one went through um carefully the budget and I just want to bring up some of the main things that we talked about um first covering our what we got for our estimated uh increase of property value for this year it came back um close to June 1st when it was released it was at 10.41% so in comparison to the previous year um the actual was 43% and then the year before that was our Peak that we've seen recently which is the 14.10% um so this is the estimated um July 1st we will get the actual and um again we don't expect it to be more than % off it's very prly close so right now with our current millage rate um this is a consistent mil trate we've had since 2012 is the uh 2.89 and uh with that percent of property value increase we're looking to an an additional Revenue to the to the city of $165,300 um one thing I want to point out in our uh our uh finance department is we had the uh $35,000 budgeted for the auditing services for this coming year um the audit committee has me has made a recommendation which will be at the next council meeting but that does follow within our uh our planed budget so if we do end up approving um at the council meeting this firm the first year will cost $ 32,200 so we're then Budget on that um the only thing they could change which we do not expect is if for some reason we had to do a single audit that would be an additional cost of $2,300 um I don't think we were qualifi for a single audit because they recently raised the amount of government funding that they received over a million dollars which is a lot of money our budget so we don't anticipate plan um another thing coming up is our legal contract for City attorney um this past budget year we had $76,000 budget for Legal Services a lot of that um was for the charter revision that we anticipated um our current retainer is $3,000 per month which equates to the $36,000 per year the rest of that is budgeted for outside of retainer um the retainer basically covers our our regular meetings uh in regular City business I have the contract and I can send you guys all copies to to review um just to familiarize yourself with the how we build and um when we go through re negotiating this contract for in the future but I believe with our current budget which I dropped out the uh the charter revision piece of it so I put in 61,000 that's the SE number to we been there for whatever we know with as far as contract negotiations and that should be coming up in April 202 I have a question about that um all of these ordinance changes that we are doing uh we can't they're going to be sometime after October so that's going to put us into this budget year uh how much um how much do you think that uh we're going to be charged in excess I run those through because that's that's quite a bit it is quite a bit U most of the work I trying to get completed by our planner which is Mr Cerna um and that is a different line atem uh which was the other Professional Services that we increased in our budget this year um Randy will have some part in in drafting those ordinances hopefully they're pretty near completion I'd like to get them written and geted for the end this budget year budget last year so that's my um we saw that the law enforcement Services were looking at a 7% change increase um one idea that came in I'm going to contact the chief of police over at U the Largo Police Department and see if they be interested in giving us proposal for policeing services we see how that number comes in while you're on that I brought up about getting so much money back from B shes but we don't have some we never got we've never given the time a lot that the shareff spend and I've been going to a lot of their Council meetings I hear the issue 30 30 is like the minimum tickets they issue just in the parking lots during the month each ticket takes a while um I don't know how much we were subsidized there I did ask the captain captain to to to work with the finance department over there and see if they can give me some kind of calculations to understand how they do it I don't know it's solely based on time but if you did break down the time it's an hour and 20 minutes a day um but there may be other factors I'm waiting to hear about I don't believe that's any I [Applause] get okay um me chime in on the the increase I wrote a nice letter to the gentleman that that sent us the bad news about the increases and I told him that we had a huge increase last year we had a h we're getting a huge increase this year and it comes to the tune of about 15% over 2 years um Kyle got a call from Captain ler uh and the same evening I got a call from the sheriff gter call me and um he uh informed me that this is not just a b air Beach increase it's the same increase over the entire County and it's basically the reason why we got hit last year was because they had to uh raise pay uh to stay competitive to keep losing uh to keep from losing uh officers to Pasco and Hillsboro um but uh this year it's insurance and then more pay increases and that's why he's having to uh to do what they're doing so I I thought we were getting picked off and uh and and I was pretty mad about it whenever I wrote the letter but uh I I was actually kind of impressed by call me and uh U but I did at the same time uh I spoke with Woody Brown in Laro and I asked him if he would uh consider doing services for us and I said I can't guarantee that we would actually get through with that but it would be nice to have a quote so we could actually see if if there's even you know if they're even in the ballart as far as the sheriff's department goes and what they're charging us or are they undercharging us or you know I I would just like to see you at know so maybe so how did he respond if they did that would they have to hire additional I'm sure they would I'm sure they would but you know I told them I said I see your cars right here all the time that's right you know so it's not really that much uh the only difference is is that you wouldn't have you wouldn't become from three directions floro would only be across the bridge and they would be coming in and out so um but aren't there officers paid I don't know if they are or not I I just uh I thought it would be a good exercise to see if we could get a quote if they're if they would even entertain deal they may have already heard about us and don't want to deal with be how about clear going to to I have not spoken with clear water I just thought Flor to begin with and uh I know that also that there's been some apprehension about us having uh any business interactions with the city of clear water in the past so I chose to see if they would be interested well I'm not complaining when I'm not complaining about the increase I it is what it is I mean I think we have the best deputies Florida I've never heard any of our citizens complain about any of them always there for you we see um I'm just complaining about I I don't think we're getting Fair Shar we sharing bud you knowy we get back I think that should be looked at okay please continue okay so um sorry I'm just flipping through the it' be on page 16 this actually is not in this draft this came up during uh my meeting with member uh Roberts um and we uh you know he's interested in U looking at some of the the work order software Public Works software that you can use um that has a lot of options and a lot of um benefits and we uh he did some research we came up with a one called eyew work and we demoed it um which was free um but we sat through about an hour um went through the basic package saw all the options that that were available um we included our Public Works administrator um Aaron in as well where we asked a lot of questions and uh we were very impressed where the software is today um it all runs off of the web browser um it's a different than it used to be when I was over in the city of Oldsmar and you had to run on your own server so it also was very impressive because you can tailor it to your city size and everything that you do so that there's a lot of uh variables um when you create work order forms you can create the fields specifically for what you use and not anything more that was never a thing in the past it was kind of like you had set certain options and they were all on your forms um the same thing with reports which was um the ability to just create mass amount of reports depending on what the what the data in question is um and you know after doing the demo definitely saw a lot of benefits um but we didn't have the price yet and then U later that day the proposal was sent over and it came back very very reasonable price um for it's it's set up where you have a startup be to to build the program um they do it in 60 days um their programers work directly you they use our maintenance plan as they start building our database in our in our Fields with that and then we tweak it as we wi but um again you know I was very impressed that the uh has the annual cost um for the basic package is $2,200 um that's just a yearly cost and then um an addon is that for a user no that is for the entire program no unlimited users and I my intention would be that every staff member all eight of us use this program it's kind of like a central work order program because we're all kind of directly involved whether it's um you know intaking the calls or you know assigning the work and approval of the work so we would all have access um and then there's a there's an add-on package which is a storm water package that applies to us cuz that's our main utility um that's a that's a $1,400 a year cost so the yearly cost we're looking at um $3,600 a year um but again with the storm water add-on you know we do uh are are uh required permitting through the state and we have to track through forms and spread sheets all this data anyways and it is part of our regular maintenance um but what what we would do do is we build our our existing GIS that we have our storm water system into the database but we we do run our inspections our work orders our Val checks um through this program obviously keeping track of Staff time keeping track of cost of the materials um and also the uh the uh parts and the uh just the inventory in general things that we keep on hand and um just tracking the maintenance of our equipment so kind of everything ties into this is my main point and that as we go um when we're assigning you know what the uh the cost per employee is cost of time cost of materials all this would be tracked um which will be very useful especially when it comes to um kind of keeping keeping track of and and showing where our uh our time our um you know productive time is going so that we can pull this up and and kind of see you know what these costs are and and and furthermore down the road when we're looking at our storm water system because we know we're constantly doing repairs on we're dedicating so much time to it we'll be able to generate reports that show you know where that money is building so I just I just think this is the this is the future um a lot of cities have already kind of implemented these type of programs I think they're getting to the point where you know they're very affordable now you're currently tracking all spreadsheets more or less an email I mean a lot of our communication is just it's coming in from phone calls it's going to me and then I'm funneling it to where it is to go um a lot of times unless it's it's a routine thing that would go to Aaron directly I'm talking about the uh like Asset Management so appreciation so our asset so if you're talking about our equipment that's just a separate spreadsheet we're keeping track of the miles the hours um time the last minutes A lot of times you got to go pull up the last invoice to get more information it's not exactly a smooth system but we are tracking it more and this software does all that for you it builds it all in one um would you say the amount of Labor that you're I wouldn't say wasted but using to to do all these functions now is it easily $6,000 or more a year oh oh labor to to track all of this sh I would say when yes because you're going to benefit from once we all get used to using the system they're no longer filling out paper reports I think the real benefit is when there's a question about specifically how much money we're spending on this or that and it's going to be there and we're going to be able to pull information on it so in time it's going to become more and more valuable you said you got this soft or they you were able to talk them down to 6,000 uh that's probably a first year right so the startup right now is six and what I mentioned was um you know our purchasing procedures if anything over $5,000 spend one time but we have to get a second quote and he said well what's the threshold for that because I may be a work with you I said $55,000 so he said well then you know if you guys are seriously considering us then we'll get it below that number for start now will we be required to get a quote if he raises the rate next year um for the for the annual rate we're looking at this is a three-year contract so year years yes that was my after that we'll see what we how the employees well will we talk to them no not yet she's very good programs and computer but uh no Aaron uh brought the idea to the staff afterwards and they were excited about it we did present it as a way we know that they're working hard we know that they're doing a lot of different things and we saw it as the validations what they're doing I'm just saying change sometimes is hard to accept you know in the world but if this is something be toly and uh council member Roberts you uh you also yes okay how do you feel about I I think it's great um you know when Kyle asked me initially what did he think the ballpark was for the cost I said well I put down like 10,000 and it came in at the number of Coles reference which I thought was was pretty attractive the fact that the guy's willing to get it under five so that we can and he I think he even mentioned to F that um they would actually start it now if we wanted to so in 60 days it would be fully operational even though our budget wouldn't be until October one and he would like pay in till later just buy my software and was I told I said L of uh when you see like how many users do they had I think they have like 2500 across the country so they have an annual users meeting which from my experience that's invaluable because you you go to that annual event have an opportunity to ask people questions that have been through some of the learning curve and share information with them and say you know we're thinking about doing this they go oh don't do that we tried that it didn't work well or whatever the case may be and there's some local I think it was for Richie has it so I think it's a good I I don't want to go down a huge rabbit hole about the software but I did U where's the data being backed up in the cloud it's on Amazon Serv is still okay and is there opportunity for you to actually download that software or the at any time we decide to leave they will get you know the GI 60 days but they will provide all that information back to our information and what if they just close their doors one day he saying I'm waiting for the cloud of rain yeah well you know Cloud I don't have a problem with Cloud software what I have a problem with is all the data being only in the cloud because things can't happen we saw it with Amazon web services specifically so it's it's a good question to ask can ask for uh I they could provide data so often that at least can keep it before going to crash right something like that on his question about what happens if they go away how long they been in business the way this works anymore is develop it get going and sell it is that Hur us help us I guess been fact 2500 customers does have that's true and I mean I feel like everything that they're going to import in that we already have existing is going to come in in the form of um you know spreadsheet or common eliminated values so yeah there's always a chance that they could be bought out or changed um but I feel like today's technology a okay and the only other question is uh or what I'd like to know is what's their uptime policy when 2001 start just something to find out they're up time policy most most people have enough time policy whenever their software is a service and that's that's important because the last thing you want to is that well they're in India and they do all their maintenance while you're open for business okay that kind of thing and there's usually a plan so that if there's a problem they're going it's this type of problem they're going to responded next time it's a different level of problem another okay Monday through Friday 6: a.m. to 5: p.m. mountain scatter time what was the other thing they usually have performance standards so if there are outages it defines how quickly they'll respond [Applause] okay hours yeah okay what else um so get to the uh Capital part of the operating budget I added a $30,000 budget for golf B Ro holiday lighting um this would be to I I understand it's why we did have light utility lighting I don't know how long ago that was but we did have it that's why we have the plugs on some of the pools um primarily on the main streets um so we currently we have existing 19 and they were pretty consistent all the way to get up the 25th and there's a big gap so part of this expense would be to have enough holiday decorations that we have you know every Major Street up and then when we get up to here where we get the gaps we just keep that same dist I'm assuming we'll be presented with those decorations oh no yeah so this is just to have it in the budget but yeah definitely have you guys you don't have anything going forward like me anyy you know what I'm saying I can talk to say they indan rocks and see how much replacing they're doing I can tell you now the Christmas tree actually start except for whenever I don't hit um real quick um on this partion of the budget I'm I'm taking out the uh the patrol bolt that we had in there that out it's in this grap but I don't think we need it at this point time um as far as capital uh projects we're we're saving on the same same amounts of plan most of the stuff is uh you know H roof replacement um you know the bridge repairs Bridge replacement we're saving for that in the long run uh one thing to note is we're still saving for Street resurfacing because we um used everything up to this year in our current project so we're starting to St we're going to doering next um we have money in the uh bridge lighting replacement I actually for the first time expense that account for repair um but that that's really kind of a piece of money if you have bu got light all back up before we collect any kind of reimbursement um but yeah again same same sa program um and then as we need U replacement whether it's a seaw wall or fishing dock that will come IMM proposal the uh Marina budget we're right now we saw our last increase uh per foot in 2023 and our final increase per the resolution being 2025 April 1st um right now uh you know kind of keeping everything working making repairs as we have have to uh but you know kind of status quo and then uh storm water budget uh we again we're collecting the same uh storm water uh assessment fees and um you know again repairing pipes as they they become compromised we're taking care of a lot of our pipe being in this project um the missing pipes just because we know out um as one big b get price um but you know there's always things coming up there's always cleanings to be done and as we have money I'd like to continue to purchase um you know back look prent check valves um because there are some areas where we see these real high 3.6 Tides you do see a pop out of different trains not as bad as ones we've already done but it's still a thing so um I also like the fact that when we put it prevents the mar oyers getting into so that helps us in the long doing the maintenance we we collect a flat have we ever looked at like a bill thing that generat more money um you know talk about PP be considered I think when they model the assessment consult and where do the Ninth Street improvements come in this budget for the current project so the Ninth Street pump project um right now is would come out of reserves um you know we don't have right design and plan I mean we could we kind of have an idea what the number would be if we want to STI it in our next year's budget we can do that I think it' be good to have okay I think we'll be closer to that number especially as we get you know August you know but yeah all add something for now placeholder that's all that's it did anyone have any uh changes or recommendations that are not in this draft budget I think the only thing I saw really was that the were looking into the attorney contract yes uh we were going to possibly look into Price shopping for police services and um you remove the boat going to try to sneak that in there again there was there's one tiny item that I just like to comment on and I commend kle for this uh for the library charges oh yes I skipped over that yes CU I I I'll just the state for the record that I was offended as incensed irritated when I learned that um Beller Beach had increased the cost for library cards I thought there's this is a pretty fundamental service that that a modern day civilization offers their people and so I'm glad that we're taking care of that and I will say too when I first moved here and I found out about how they were doing their Library I thought how smart is that we're too small of a town to put your own Library um so go next door get a card come back and we'll reimburse you and I thought great well you pay for only the people that ask for it you don't have a special assessment for it and and you allow people to educate themselves and um when I I just thought it was so petty when started playing around with that reimbursement so thank you for that yeah have you been talking to my wife what we change CH so on n- departmental uh 519 it's on page 12 um 59810 Library Services um we had budgeted $2,500 we bumped it up to 5,000 um the actual for 2023 budget was $2,150 um it's really just at one point we dropped it from the full of $100 the half reiners with the thought that people were getting cards that weren't using them but I can tell you right now we never really saw a major fall off we just got a lot of people that were not didn't like the fact that we weren't reimbursing the full thing so um I I added in here just from kid resident comments um to go back to full reimbursement a huge chunk of money but I don't see just cuz people can get a library C it it still takes a lot you got to go down there and you got to get registered you got to come here and right you're not really going to do that much it's it's a beautiful Library they charge $100 a year I think it's a little exessive I mean now they said you can join but you CA this to join the Cooperative way higher I have a number somewhere from last year my little booty town in in in Illinois it was a $400 a year assessment for the library 15 years ago mine was great M was too yeah and now you went in there Sheed residency and gave you a COR was that coming ta yeah but I mean there was a line on the tax form so that's what saying you pay $400 a year taxes I'm just saying we pay 100 I mean my wife know and my daughter they each pay 100 you know before I just think that's a little steep of course we're not using someone else's Li too oh it's look it's a beautiful light the whole thing is G it's four books yeah yeah Kyle what's next on the uh what's the next day oh next day so we got a regular meeting coming up um and then the next budget Workshop is going to be uh July 15th you do what 15 sorry all right now we're on General business UNF business would anyone like to go home I just have a comment so I'm just cheing my account I will not be here for the beginning of July through the 10th this counc but we're still three strong so that works right yes it does any other comments no would someone like to make a motion second all in favor let's go home everyone Sun"
