    "transcript": "all right welcome back everyone it is now 6:28 this is the city council work session at the city of b beach uh please rise and join me in the allegiance the United States of America and to the for it stands one nation God indivisible liy andice for all would you please call the council member Frank Banker still present council member Mark Chester here council member Belinda Livingstone here council member lesy Nota here council member Lloyd Roberts here mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reer here City attorney Randy MOA presid and vice mayor jod Shirley was unable to attend thank you P we're going to move right over to the first agenda item which is discussion of increasing uh the rates for solid waste and recycl and collection Services Mr reer you have thank you man so what I tried to do with this spreadsheet is uh illustrate the current rates um that we build our residents uh per unit whether it's a single family home or a multif family condominium unit um and we do that through the utility bill on a b monthly basis so at the very top where it's this Turner race 2019 um we focus in on the highlighted yellow line which is what you'll see in your utility bill with if you're a single family home charge $48 if you're at a condominium that uses cans as opposed to dumpsters you're get charge $45 and then if you're use a dster that come $ 3950 so that's what our rates are currently and with that with the units um over a year's time that produces a revenue of 336 54,000 i54 and that is um highlighted in the green so as you can see our uh Waste Services has gone out so our current contract with waste probe is a 393 46440 um so we need to um increase our billing rate so that we're covering the cost of the service um what I presented in the middle line is it where it says minimum rate increase that that's $8 across the board per unit um so for single family home for the bonly fee it needs to go from $48 to6 every two months um for the multi can 45 and for the multi family dster 3950 to 4750 so that that in itself will produce a annual revenue of the 396,000 312 so that is a little cushion um so you can keep even buildable rates rather than getting down to the difference of pennies um when looking this over I think um and considering I think that's the best way to go is to just cover what is needed to cover the cost of the contract this would be adopted by resolution in the next city council meeting um and then probably most like most likely the CPI is going to go up next year so we're probably going to have to do a slight reate in increase but it it can be explained um to the residents that um you know along with the cbii that's the reason that they're seeing the rate increase and the plan is when we do put a rate increase out in the utility bill to have a a explanation of a flyer that explain you know to the resident what what occurred um how much our our services have gone up and the reasoning for the the higher Bill rate um I did an alternative rate increase which was twice as much um the only reason I did that and you know I did some research the last time we did a rate increase was 2019 um and prior to that it was 2018 and from 18 to 19 it just went up $3 roughly across the board um but as you can see I don't know if it's just when they when we started building residents for the service if we just always had a a higher Revenue than what we what our expenditures were because if you if you took the the rate at the time that they raised um the the cost $3 so the utility for $3 we already were meeting um the cost of the service so I my assumption is that over time as as the service went up they uh proportionally increased the utility rate but weren't actually I guess calculating it per what the revenue was versus the expend so I put that last at bottom line that would if we were to go back to 2019 um as you you can see the 2018 Waste Management contract was you know 2 $283,600 25 but we were back then with these rates we were still collecting you know over $50,000 more um in revenue for those services so the reason you know I just tried to compare that with this alternative rate increase um something similar um because as you can see since 2019 we've seen drastic increases in service costs but we we haven't had to R the rates and that's because we had so much cushion now was that because we had uh a pad if we were stuffing into reserves if you collect money for uh collection services that that money can't be usedful for anything else is that correct that was that was being put into the general fund because it was being collected and it's paid out F so it was just it was just going into reserves I see was so we could use it it goes into the general fun use it for any right yeah be moved any any fun so what it sounds to me like you're saying is we can charge whatever we want to the I'm not in no way I don't want anyone to think that I'm proposing that but I I'm a little confused that that we're collecting 118% Revenue to contract one year and that 18.64% was not spent for what it what we collected for that and so it bothers me right I just this I start calculating R okay um obviously it's it's probably good to have a little p uh so because they are going to increase the rate uh anytime we negotiate a contract they have a cap on how much they can increase but it does go up um I don't have a problem charging a little more but I would like for that money to be used solely for collection services and not or just a general f because I think that that's a misrepresentation of uh what it states on their right Council comments questions yes I agree with you 100% but I think what what Kyle's put together here is and he commented already that it's going to be much closer with the revenue that we're going to be collecting that goes fromis County to it just goes in our general fund yes so there's less likelihood if there's a be paning there we can just do that each year right we we can just change that number each year um at the same token at the same time if for some reason we end up spending more money than what we collected the fact that it is in a general fund is probably a good thing because it gives us a little bit of flexibility there if we had to you know we had to over spend by some small amount theoretically were okay it was in its own separate line item fund and we needed more money for that and that was a fund that required us to remove dollars that's kind of whate so but I agree with you 100% this minimum rate increase which still gives us uh you know like $3,000 pading but there was some additional charges by the company we should be okay and that's that's pretty much what we get charged where um we PID County to to use their utility bill system oh we pay them the servers I thought that they did it for free cuz they like this that's other questions or comments for Mr re Mr Banker you're very quiet well we're going to get an $8 increase we could have got what four or five single family it's easy to get big it's so it's so hard to get small and watched Tampa do their budget get $40 million in debt I I think we're going to have that big but prices just keep going up and if we can control we had an opportunity do you asked okay but you didn't answer my question not your opinion of how we just voted I wanted to know your opinion on this I just gave it to you we could have saved the taxpayer around $3.50 $4 a month I yes Mr chest I I don't I like the idea I need to turn I don't need to turn this yes you do need to turn it on because uh they're listening on okay all right I I'm good with a pad small small pad um things go up I think everybody intends knows that that happens cost of everything is going up so I think that's only reasonable I'm I like the idea of being in the black but not to where we have like a slush fund um we don't need that I but being in the black is great and I like the idea of we wait until the increases come and we pass it on at that time I might be dead in a year and I don't want to pay anything more than I have to between now and then thank you Mr Chester any other comments Livingstone I'm in agreement with believe that the $8 rate is good I don't like the 18% Lage that we've had in the past now I do have a one question about this rate um we have storms and things happen and uh you were able to acquire a dumpster uh for sandbags and I think that that they would cost anything they just roll it in that right I haven't seen to build for that yet they can still build us per per we I expect them to bill us okay but they may not okay so uh something like that happens and we're at 100% on our collection on how much we're collecting which is about we're you know 34% historically we've done 15 roughly a 15% ad is that right yes okay um I think 15% is too much but I don't know if I'm totally comfortable with just let's break even and not have any any reserves other than the general f so um I would be happy with maybe 102 I know it's more but at the same time uh storm season keeps coming and you know if uh worst case if we get too much well then we can back it off but I would I would think that 72% may not be enough to make it comfortable what the rest of the council how do you feel about that on that note when Irma came up here didn't have private contract to pick up because they had gravers and it was just overwhelming Waste Management did do private contract said that money came that was on Council I would assume that money came out of the general one that came out of the reserves that we keep for hergen disaster and he recouped most of that Mone um and just to to the note about the um what we did for the sandbags I was going to charge that dumpster fee out of our emergency fund um if we I don't know if we're going to break the threshold that I can get uh you know before $1,400 I did from the previous storm you have have so much to qualify for small project but if we do qualify for small project I will be able to get the money reverse so as long as you have Reser if it's disaster related and you're expending money you have reserves which we do in our general fund by resolution um you know if it's significant we can get a large perc of okay yes Mr um we've got the minimum rate increase is $8 per month and the alternative alternative rate increase is $16 per month I think maybe if we did $12 per month it would give us a little more cushion but not not as much as the alternative rate increase is there a reason you did the eight and the 16 oh the reason it was just in reflection to what we had previously mats is any alterate rate AG to we that 46 H yeah that would have covered there I had a budgeted so what we currently have in our budget is enough to cover the 25% so we actually budgeted a little higher this year yeah putting in a cushion I agree with Mr Chester I drop dead how do I get that money back i' have to come back in hey you go me a little cushion I like big I'm absolutely against slush I've seen that in athletics where people are like we have 30 grand okay any other questions or comments discussions yes Livingstone is there any other reason why the management company would charge us say for we initially moved here there were a lot of large items that were left over from the individuals so we had Waste Management come out with special pick up of large items does the city get charged for that in addition to the res or the res now the way the contract works is um you set that up with the collection company and then like in our contract now it has the fees in the back and it's put it's under bulk services I think it was $57 per so that just to the resident City that's to the res so the resent sets it up so you know if you have a lot of say refrigerators freezers up you have to that cost exra fund Services emergency to is that pretty much what I'm hear so if the county has um the breed collection contractors um that we pay you back so if there's an emergency it's over what waste average collector can do so you bring in special collection services and uh we pay back those contract those contracts so they're at set rates that they can't like gou for um and then because you used it for disaster services submit all that backk and you're prepared to raise the rate every year yes it's it's calculation in the resolution okay uh if you're good with this i' say I'm good with this and what do the other council members think Mr okay Mr Chester I know where you stand Mr Roberts good all right all righta good deal all right uh any general business me start general bu sure different items I I put the uh the marina do um attorney Mora and I went through the policy um added some as definitions um we also went through the agreement that that the uh licenses signs um once they're off the way list to to Ren we added some things there changed some word around so I provided that I sent that the email and provided a paper copy so I'd like um you guys get the review um and kind of give any comments work on this for I think we're over a year now close to it it's more than that try more than two two complete terms okay so yeah I'd like to get it U for approval in a regular meeting um and then you know put it into action so you like to read through carefully and uh make sure it makes sense it's in line with what you know the council vision this would be voted on by resolution this would be contract resolution we would yeah we probably just do a a resolution setting for the policies just to make it clear that it's adopted by the council what else um so bbcf a b d Community Foundation is looking to for their next project to be um doing a Veterans Memorial uh at Crossman Park work so they'd like they they asked for me to run this idea as soon as possible so they could start Trad raise funds for this and um in general uh the first phase would be to um clear out some of the overgrown vegetation um in the middle of the of the Little Island area where the shall is in the park um there's a small sign that says Crossman park where you can't really even see it um with the Indian off that's in front of it so they'd like to replace the sign with a biger sign um dedicating the park and they're also looking to install an American flag a flag pole um and you know dedicate it to Veterans so um they're uh just wanted to get you know make sure it was good for the council to approval before they started you know putting the word out the recently Council like the idea don't like the idea like the idea anything for how big's the flag going to be 25 it's got to be big not as big as City Hall we have Anin on SI and they also um they also build in like an adop the park opportunity for um somebody to put more Landscaping had it's nice to see that we have someone who is contributing to the community doing cool uh how is the kayak launch how's that being received um I notified theb scening Foundation that is there um I I want to send something out um do we have the newsletter we did we should send something out cuz we just put in the uh the launch system that stabilizes put that in today so maybe another uh note just to go out and let people know that it's there and usable and uh so it has a handrail otherwise it's not useful for me it's got a hand rail down to the Calk it's uh 12T long catalog it's 4T wide it's got a little tow rail on it and then there hand rail down the steps and then we installed the was ccil member A's idea he found it online it it's actually pretty cool it you can adjust it with the tie but it's like a stabilizer in the water you get it right where the water is at and you pull your kayak up on it and it gets close to the cockpit and stabilizes itly standing if they rock it without don't it's got tip over on it we also install the ladder right next to it so it helps you get do you how uh how much room do you have for more bricks of room yes we sell the F second square and then we're going to work out from there uh everyone encourage your friends and neighbors to purchase pay how many need second Square you're not order them until you get whole Square the agenda yeah that's the agenda I think they're close um I know they're looking at at switching they're trying to fill in the rest of the second but then they're looking to switch to a different vendor for new bricks um but I believe they're very close I'm just I don't know exactly so everyone's good with the B more okay good deal yeah that's you know we would present something more formal the money was raised okay anything else oh um we have a savings plan for carpet for this room um if you look at it closely it's starting to get some pretty good stains um I found source all contracts that would cost us uh roughly between 24 and 36,000 to replace the carpet all in this room up this um and be with Quality Carpet um but you know we probably could get maybe a lower price once we decide the difference in price is based on the not so much the quality I cover but the design pattern so I guess they call it knit time that it takes to produce the square um it cost more money it's more machine time so if it's something we're interested in doing in the near future then I would like to I have a bunch of samples but I'd like to get the council's input on whatfield would be the best design in here and then we can find out what that cost would be and hopefully get some more quotes to find a good price how old is this this is from the installation was installed so 2010 how many events a year occur on this carpet rentals or meetings um rals uh so we definitely have at least two to three months of where every weekend we have some kind event um so I that's rough 24 spaic I'd venture to say like mid-30s and what's the uh what would you say the average uh fee we are charging to make use of this room for event most of them are nonresident and that is600 so we've made a lot of money off this carpet I don't have a problem with that at all it's got a lot of use we we've cleaned it several times and we have our own carpet cleaner we really try to get that stain over there but it keeps coming back to do that this is this is our point this is our this is how we make r600 that's pretty good Kyle try to get the word out to get every week in fil okay and you know we're we're looking to you know everything's going up like we said we're looking to kind of uh I want to say okay anything else you'd like to discuss Council any general visits yes Mr just a concern um with our sand that's getting DED which is going well um wife went took pictures to share um there are people that that go one away line and they're zipping through the neighborhood I was wondering if on the times that we're getting The Dumping if maybe we could have a deputy kind of hanging out there well just to I don't mean out in the middle of the road on Gulf I mean where K people are cutting through cuz they're running through stop signs and speeding but part of the problem is that you never know which intersection is going to be open you may have experienced that already the I'm going to tell you right now these trucks they have no EG at all they are uh they're trying to get that sand in as fast as they can and get the heck out of here so they can go get a second load and come right back and do it all over again uh I I noticed that some of the drivers will purposely put a gap in front of an opening uh and others they don't care it's it's you never know where it's going to happen I thought well maybe I could drop down to 19th and get out well they were now they're backed up that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about are the people that are trying to avoid the line they're cutting through our neighborhood I see the side roads they're not they're ignoring stop signs and speed yeah I I uh it's probably not a bad idea I don't want to have to make C you seen that in the early afternoon mostly Kyle I'm getting this information secondhand from My Wife and she's not the most reliable I'm put that in the minutes watch this so no that's I'm not worried about these guys that are done they're doing great I don't care about that I think that's wonderful in fact I wouldn't mind them do keep going all night 247 I think last we would they finished in front of my place today you my not for too long see what I do is turn the fan on louder you can't hear anything the problem is a car making a right hand turn to avoid traffic you have to have a resol closing that streets that only residents only just how do you know who's making the right hand turn the guy might say well just like when Beller uh was closed for n months in R right they had signs up no th and everything like that the cops pull you know cut yeah I'm not worried about the traffic as long as they go to speed and sh this is America that doesn't matter no I know but in a neighborhood it's Hey listen I go I'm not going to say anything about if this if this is a uh the problem that I think it may be because we have the same issue whenever Clear Water Beach is backed up we have all sorts of issues like that maybe during this month because we probably have about a month of this left maybe it's not a bad idea to uh issue a directed to the sheriff's car just to patrol uh or watch the fourway yeah and I'm thinking it's probably that afternoon W CU early in the morning well in the morning when they're doing it in the morning which my wife and I are concerned about are the people that are walking riding bikes walking their dog in the neighborhood you know they're and then you have people that are nonresidents and flying through there and they're in a hurry okay that's why they're avoiding the line and um so that um like seven to eight time cuz they're lining up before 6 and then you know once this something they're doing I I've seen it I've seen what they're that occasionally dump truck will be Crossing I mean sideways so I don't know if it's backing in or I I don't really know what's going on how they're how they're I guess they are backing in so they must have to seek assistance from either the contractor or the sheriff's department they pull up then they back in they drop their load and then they leave well whenever I think during that backing in process there must be a bottleneck that keep stopping track every time someone tries to go in there and that's that's where the right and I I I get we're going to have some issues I I I'm for it because this is going great I'm just concerned about I don't want somebody to get hit on sign streets that is out walking we have people that wear headphones and sorts of crazy things sotify Captain okay all right what can you really do well they can do a direct control so the on duty Deputy will take time during and looking forers well Speeders and stop sign Runners yeah if I want I interal no right I'm just saying if there's somebody there maybe people will slow down a little and no not we're doing what we can and and they are um I've noticed that they just sit in their car and they're just sitting in the meeting they're not doing anything those extra ones yeah so maybe what they could do is maybe go on one of the side streets and sit there that's all I'm something like that I don't expect just let them know that that we were having some complaints and all right anyone else um gent came in there dropped these off about pumping I mean we just had another little storm last week and I went through the neighborhoods U the ones that were just rone up in everybody's driveway in and a half a rain inch and a half a rain high tide was only 2.6 and it went up 10 ft and these are these are roads 12 Street just was red if you look at what we we're spending two25 million doll in a bond plus storm sewer tax we need to scrap that whole thing because if you look at the streets that we're going to redo we're not replacing anything that's going to minimize flood we're not doing anything to reduce the storm surge um and the only way you're going to get rid of it is by pumping it out some way um it was disgusting last week of my street the Seventh Street Third Street was horrible 12 Street was bad um I couldn't get down some of at first I mean your guys came out the dra I mean but until the tide went down to about 2.2 that we St Street almost every street had issues because of the storm and the push of the tide so most streets that usually don't have they Evacuate the pipes yours is the worse but those streets it was a unique event where that where they get that water push in and it it wasn't so we were getting so much rain and I went and I went through cuz I wanted to make sure um cuz I know that the that one's compromised that we know that on the camera there's a leak in the joint so I tested the water that was um what I had the guys test the water um for sality um and I started keeping logs but I know that that one had almost direct um seaw water coming into it it was a lot higher um solinity than the rest of the streets the rest of the streets were actually very very low CU they're Prim water but um I do see on your street where a pump could be utilized in makes sense Seventh Street was was horrible too and Ninth Street was pretty bad again so if you like I said Sor sorry these guys didn't stay but if they could have spoke tonight maybe bring them back in but we've had council member saying hey we don't want to replace pipes and all like that this whole project that we're spending money on is totally useless it's not going to get us anything at the end of the day the streets are paid fine okay and at the end of the day the next storm it's still so why are we doing this this is like insanity 10 well I say a lot a lot of it is replacing infrastructure especially it is the well I've looked at all the pipe videos I don't see too many pipes that were damaged rep place now I don't know what the hell top of thee look like okay see inside of the and it could be R collapse the top but know that street we don't want to do that stop at each joint um so there the middle of the pipe is compromised um when they lowered them in 20 50 60 70 years ago and used chains whatever they they cracked the outside service that's now rotted okay it's broken into the metal rebar and it's corroded it so we don't know how much damage could be 5 years down the road two years down the road 6 months down so with all the video that we did get though the the engineers are looking at that and they're putting that in the pl address the major issues um like I said with the pump it I think it's something that can work but when you talk about overall what that cost is going to be it it it could be effective but I think um we really need to get an idea of just say like your street what kind of cost you're looking at because it's definitely a much more costly venture to have you're talking about $50,000 to do three or four streets um out about 2500 so our engineer been talking to bre on this all right so uh my take on it is that we are making everything pristin and we're doing our doing our responsibility that we promised to the city uh we're making our stor drainage the best we possibly can and we're also refreshing uh the gunters and people are going to get some PID pavement and uh uh we're just basically doing it all to the point where it's as good as it can get with the type of infrastructure we're talking about so I absolutely have no problem us moving forward with these projects I do like the idea of the pumps though so I think if there's any way possible that we could affords on top of that I I would never ever say that we are wasting our money on on storm dra would you be uh willing to entertain them to come in sure I would listen to an uh to a presentation but I think that the work session is more Fitting Place kind of a little confused as why they didn't hang around well they contacted me and I said you should have asked to get on the agenda before Friday that's so I told him and I didn't get it I was out I didn't get it till like 5:00 6:00 Friday night and I wasn't going to B this before so we contact I happen to be out riding around um during that rainstorm and um I drove down both Boulevard and I turned right there at CoCo in Indian Rocks Beach the reason why I turned there was because I uh needed to turn around and so I just picked the first side street made made another right and lower my home they were put to half in water okay so this isn't isolated just b beach this company will tell you okay but this is 2023 and like I said we're doing the best we can with what we have but there there's methods to progress and get rid of well what I can tell you is if we don't do this project and we we continue to have pipe and uh check vals failing uh your pumps aren't going to do any good what they're going to do is every time high tide comes in it's going to roll in and it's going to flood the streets in this particular case with the exception of 12 this was a rain event and the checks valve closed it did what it always does it rained like hell and your streets and I I hate that that happen but uh I think we owe it to the community to at least take one and see what they have to offer okay I have a question so when they pump the water and we're in high time where are they pumping the water over the SE right no the the check Val stop the high tide generally does not go over the seaw wall it goes up to uh higher than the level of the check valve and if the check valve is not working it rushes in as soon as the tide drops down the check valve opens again and allows it to flow out and so as long as the sea water is not higher than the sea wall you can't pump it out I I get that but cuz you were talking about the solidity there's certain areas where water that is flooding isn't just rain water that's and some and the problem is when they built these homes on the water okay they already had the streets plumed in right okay but put them in too low or too high I should say so then when they put the houses on there no one wants to throw the evidence remaining there and say hey we're going to rip this up and raise this up so some of these check vals are below the 2 and2 mark on the tide we can get 3.9 ties in fact that I think you say 4 and2 4.7 you had whatever yeah when you start getting over 4T start all right and the valves will evacuate it's all about the head pressure so they even when the water is over the valve it's still if there's enough pressure it'll push that water out through the waterz you'll feel it when well yeah it's not it's not hard sh who's going to take responsibility for getting these guys on the work session I can yeah I'd like to coordinate um like I said the years with with them and they've been talking okay so that we can have them come in right all right now I only have one item that I would like to bring up and uh you know I always hate whenever whenever I want to introduce something that sounds like we're over controlling or overreaching but uh in this particular case I want to see how the council feels about it uh whenever we had the last storm we weren't draining properly it wasn't because of our check vales or or our pipes it was because all of this uh pine bark mulch was floating all over the place and finding the um the fastest way the path of least resistance and plugging all of our grains um my question is is is is that something that belongs in b beach should we seriously take a look at this and determine if if we should consider Banning it or am I just um I I don't have the problem in my yard I don't have a drain that I have to worry about but I know that others do and I saw it on the southern half of belir beach it was bad so thoughts my neighbor across the street looked like full m had a wood chip it it was so bad with debris I mean um I don't know where it all came from to be honest with but I remember when I first moved in here I bought chips and my neighbor was L and he goes you know they float really well I go what the hell you talking about he said well the first storm comes in you're going to see it all over your yard that's why we put shells and rocks down like d d you know but you make a good point because it was a total mess well I saw entire streets after the water receded you couldn't see the streets or all of the pine bark or whatever you call that stuff can you ordin that out can you well I think we're aren't we pass the moratorium now at the end of this month right uh no I believe I believe that goes through October 2025 oh 2025 okay well it's something that we can definitely discuss and uh keep it on our radar and keep bringing it up in a broader sunst remember Bankers um communities constantly regulate what substrates can be used for perious and impious surfaces um you can do it uh the challenge I think that you face from a regulatory standpoint here is how are you going to phase it out or you know site people for it if it's it's been down if if we did regulate it and I'm not saying you couldn't just saying I think that'd be your bigger challenge but as a legal can you generally speaking absent what we presently have from the legislature yes I would say that uh I I don't know how you would regulate it obviously if you had new then it would be easy to flag or something but uh I think once you stress the importance of this problem to the community is a whole uh more people will switch over eventually turns into dirt and then you get weeds yeah it's just point that my less than a year doesn't last long all right well next year if everybody still feels the same way we'll discuss this again anything else for General business do I have a motion to adjourn make a motion because Phillies are on 40 minutes do I have a second all in favor I any oppose all right good night everyone"
