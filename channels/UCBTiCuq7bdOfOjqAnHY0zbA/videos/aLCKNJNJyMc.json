pledge of allegiance today our city does not have a special service on veterans day which is november 11th and um i always like to honor the brave men and women who have served our country veterans

families old people in this country thank you thank you from this city thank you for me thank you for all of us it's not said enough we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing if you didn't do what you did thanks again all right [Music] i'm not a clerk if you would please council member frank banker councilmember glenn gunn i'm here council member leslie otero councilmember rita swope vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred riley and councilmember robin aki hasn't arrived yet okay let the record reflect that glendon is on our telephone hookup we have five people present so we have a quorum proceed first item of business is the approval of the agenda under 10 motion questioned by frank bancard second second hero uh never dave gaddis either and any discussion no discussion by the council any discussion by the citizens council take a voice vote all in favor of approving the agenda all right anyone opposed passes five six to zero the way we do citizens comments if you're new here on any item that is not on the agenda okay so if you see it listed on the agenda there's going to come a time know come over and talk with us the way we're going to do it is you come right up over here by the podium please announce yourself give us your name and address and you have three minutes of time if you need up to 12 minutes you have to get that from other people they need to give that to you beforehand we ask that we speak um with decorum and with a politeness to everyone here and i think it should work out real well with that said is there anyone who would like to address the council yes sir gentlemen here hi brad glover 126 9th street um so two things one i wanted to see if we have any update and i know these are comments and i don't know if you guys can interact but you know 9th street here which i live has been continually been flooded and it seems to be i've been here i guess three years in a row and still nothing gets done and it's a high tide it still floods um it's really a drainage issue from like 128 to 124 and so just trying to understand if there's any type of room in the budget for basic basic infrastructure would be awesome and number two i wanted to see if there's any update or anything around beach umbrellas on the beach i've got two young kids it really makes it a quality of life issue for us here in miller beach not being able to have safety for my kids from a sun point of view i know you guys have talked about it a lot but at the same time you know we haven't really received a lot of updates on it from our perspective and we're getting a little frustrated around that so mainly just two comments questions but it is really affecting quality of life here at bellar beach so i just want to point that out to you guys okay thank you so here's what i'm like i'd like to do um if the council is present normally mr glover we we're not supposed to have an interaction direct interaction you had that part right um but i hate to say to you because i i will absolutely address your feature hosting i'm the man on that that's my lawsuit i'll tell you all about it but um the other thing is the city manager and i think you're gonna like what you have what he has to tell you but i'd rather do that now than have you wait till the end of the night and stuff but in order to do that i need these council to tell us that it's okay to dispense with the rules and that we have this interaction so with that said does anybody have a problem if we dispense the rules and answer these questions for him now any comments citizens have any comments bringing to a vote voice vote all in favor of dispensing with rules so that we can answer the citizens tonight anyone opposed how's the 6-0 let's give you your answers um first on 9th street let's take care of that first i'm going to be furthest to the city manager he's our expert on it yes that 9th street is in a of projects uh this year is 12th and 13th and 17th and 18th and i think i don't have it in front of me but if you want to call just call city hall ask for me i'll give you the year when it's done there is a check valve on night street and uh so there should be high tide water coming up but when it rains there is water because the pipes are full yeah and so it's on the list of projects okay no i and and i can tell you at high tide it definitely floods and it doesn't drain so it's just constant standing water and so when we try to get out on a bike or walk down the street the streets completely flooded so you know and i know that we're coming into this park and a lot more people use this park so it would be really great if we could accelerate ninth street again it's been three years so i just want to make sure that i understand when we can get on the list so thank you does that answer that question i'm gonna answer your on beach morrow's issue it's not a city issue if the city doesn't actually it's the citizens who hold the rights to use 6th 3 12th street 19th street beach accesses that's why it's the citizens that have taken the step which is my lawsuit but there there's 43 people who have joined me so an update everyone in the city i'm glad you asked this because there's no other way i would have been able to say this okay the beach umbrella band is in full force you may have gotten away with putting it up up until it's time and the reason why you got away with it is because the sheriffs were unable to write you a ticket at the last council the commission meeting of the bel air short commissioners they passed a very heavy fine schedule the first umbrella violation will cost you one hundred dollars your second one close to two hundred fifty dollars your third one and thereafter for the next five years will cost you five hundred dollars pipe if you decide to challenge it with their magistrate i know you're shaking your head i shook my head 500 upwards of a fine for your first violation so it could be a very expensive afternoon at the beach that is in play right now they passed that last time i think the 29th was the 10-day waiting period so if you go out there and put one up you might get lucky and the sheriff gives you a warning you might not i can tell you they didn't they get to keep the revenue from this they get to keep pretty much all the revenue and they're looking forward to making that revenue in terms of the lawsuit i can tell you anything that's not public okay the initial motions failed i won they i defended them successfully we're now we finished the paper discovery we're now going to start with the depositions that will end the rest of the discovery which should end by the end of february and once that ends then the lawyers will do the lawyer stuff because there's a bunch of issues that are constitutional issues which are fairly complex that are going to be briefed and possibly depending on how the agreement between the two parties goes may be able to be actually tried before the trial it's scheduled for trial next july that's as fast as justice works okay it's almost two years that we have to win i am going nowheres i'm going to continue this um there's still time if anybody wants to intervene you'd be an intervener if you want to do that it's a lady here should wear an adventure my name is deborah wall see her okay do not come to me okay no i appreciate it i just it's just it's unfortunate that we just can't even use it on just the injury right health and safety issue for the kids for myself i mean his three-year-old granddaughter was thrown into a hot sun right so i just two weeks ago a neighbor and he has an autistic grandchild that no longer can use the beach the baby busy cannot stay in the sun for more than 30 minutes now i don't know why this council doesn't grasp a hold of this and take it to the courts mr manzo's doing it i applaud you for that but that's not your job kingdom it's just council because you as a taxpayer me as a taxpayer it affects the property matters yeah okay and i've pleaded you know up here and i just can't get enough support well i appreciate it thank you guys so much and thanks for letting me no problem take care of those beautiful children thank you thank you hi um mike table3329 yeah i'd like to add my comments to uh each issue first of all it's kind of disingenuous it's not all beaches it's only the beaches that are within bel air shores correct so a lot of citizens we use our beaches control is my problem my problem comes why isn't the city council working what is your excuse for not working in this issue i will tell you this came up and i believe and i'd be wrong on this because i'm going straight off recollection pre-election mr disabled um but the robin aki made a motion i don't even know that it got a second i can't participate in it obviously since it's my lawsuit any citizen any citizen could have brought that lawsuit and by the way to dispel any misinformation there's been more than a sheriff have put out okay i didn't go directly to a lawsuit they were we went across the street on july 21st 2020 in an attempt to resolve it the city manager came glenn gunn came uh we might say went across zoom myself and jody shirley we spoke on different things we didn't speak on behalf of the city libraries did speak on behalf of the city they rejected us okay after i was told by mayor schmidt when i called earlier to get a moratorium on the thing uh he said give me a chance to work on it and then ultimately they said now we're just gonna leave it in place one of their commissioners and i have to take my legal files and it's public information for them actually said i'll listen to bellar beach but i'm not changing my mind every commissioner okay he had no intention of changing his mind if there was this disinformation that oh we were close to the settlement there was no settlement because i gave them two weeks or two of notice of advanced notice before the lawsuit but i didn't go right to lawsuit i gave him two weeks that deadline would have been i think august 14th or so i might be off by a day or two i didn't bring the lawsuit to a september 28th they had a month and a half to reach out to me not one person picked up the phone not one person picked up an email that one person contacted this city and said voted wait a minute mr manzo hold off okay and then i finally pulled the trigger and said i'm gonna go for the lawsuit and that's what's going to get these rights back and i'm going to win this well my question is you know that's your lawsuit that's not on behalf of officers i'm asking you as mayor why isn't the city council working this issue i have to recuse myself so i asked the city council right that's what i'm doing so i thought i did what i could do so i got something perfect right so city council i council to am something about it all right i i've asked to go to court for a temporary court injunction could get nowhere without the city or i don't know as a city okay because it affects everyone that lives well every one of us would be cancers and we just can't get the support of we can't get four votes here on the city council to take it look again i i commend you the mayor for doing this i'm not going to intervene with the lawsuit because i don't want to be stifled all right um but then if you're not interfering i mean i'm just i'm not asking about it that's and if you look at the tapes back and i believe july 2020 this entire council was on board before they went to the bel air shores meeting to do something the mayor clearly says and if i say something wrong correct the mayor clearly says we're going to give them a short notice but we want our wages back okay and i'm paraphrasing you're right any other council members not sure i'll address that may i say something first yes we'll say it directly as i can the city council has a uh code provision that says the council cannot discuss prospective or pending litigation that's litigation's not brought by a member it's probably private investigation so that's why i that they have to abide by so the status of the case is that the city did not was not a party to the lawsuit the city has not been brought into the lawsuit and private citizens initiated the lawsuit and private citizens are involved in the litigation process and up until now the city council has not taken any action to become involved in a lawsuit and the lawsuit is taking its course so that that's the status um i would caution the city council on uh discussing prospective litigation because that's the rule so that that's my uh statement to the city council and giving them legal advice and i understand that not all attorneys are correct that's your opinion i understand no it's not my opinion it's what the city code states so they can't discuss pending litigation what is their personal feelings on this issue they are getting the two cities together they cannot discuss pending litigation that involves a city they cannot discuss according to the rules that exist now prospective litigation i didn't make up the rule i'm only telling you what it into a is by doing that the city council can no longer function in support of the citizens other systems don't like me i don't necessarily disagree with you but i'm i don't know what the city code says [Music] it all i want okay and yeah first of all it's not prospective litigation the city's never been threatened with coming into this lawsuit and they are not counter-claimed by the city of this um the town of delaware okay so it's my private lawsuit and anyone can join it subordinate to me as an intervener i can object to people coming in i'm not objecting to a single person i will objectify not sharing my views which is we want our umbrellas back but that that is long more than an umbrella ordinance that i'm fighting i'm fighting for their abuse of the parking lots if you go there frank banglart is a witness to this one a 100-ton construction crane was parked there they've used their parking lots as if they're their own personal parking lots i'm fighting that and i'll tell you what okay they don't own they own those lots but they own them with a sole purpose and the sole purpose is to keep them for the bellar beach citizens living east of the center line of gulf boulevard boulevard and it's for our beach invading purposes they are entitled to no other use that's my interpretation and about six other attorneys and i'll tell you what they use them as if it's theirs and i'm out to change that we're going to quiet that title and what we're going to do because they've abused their trusteeship i'm not telling you anything that's not in the lawsuit i'll be happy to send you a copy of it okay that's public record and i will send you that my law my my file somebody's going to ask here if they can have my litigation filing no you can but the lawsuit itself is a public record of better short i'll be more than happy to give you that um and it's also you can get another city i don't do what with understand it says that we have the right to have beachy bathing purposes and my interpretation is very simple i go to every beach in the country every beach in the world and i've never found anybody bands shade or it's a health issue it's just ridiculous okay you need to have a reasonable basis to have a law that's the lowest level of scrutiny my take on this is that it's unconstitutional because in florida we have what's numbers are right for privacy and you're saying look right privacy on a beach you couldn't be more public the right of privacy is your medical privacy you have the right to make all medical determinations yourself under the florida constitution i'll decide if i want to expose my skin to the sun and this is the only time i could ever in my life ever think of the city taking away a protective device the city makes you wear masks the city makes your other state wears you make seat belts and helmet laws and everything else for protection okay and they're taking away umbrellas that can stop skin cancer that can stop heat stroke here's this is unprecedented and it's more than that because they opened up the bottle when they decided to tangle with me okay point of order point of order he's well over his three minutes for citizen's comments and discussing the lawsuit is not the city is not a part of it it has nothing to do also has bicycles on the beach down along that wet sand which is crazy money can ride bicycling if god bless you if you could ride it in the dry sand okay and right but down there something called florida public trust doctrine that means that belongs to all the citizens and actually all all the people okay anyone can go and use that wet sand for recreation purposes and you can't ride a bicycle in your city now we're going to come to later tonight and put a ban on electric bicycles i don't want to ride electric bicycles but a pedaled bicycle you know good old-fashioned foot power bicycle why not that's recreation and on top of that why do i have to fast while i'm on the beach that's another thing that's unconstitutional so i'm attacking all of it when i get done i take away their trusteeship because they hold it as trustee when they get done there's gonna be another group hopefully there that runs those spots and they run properly that's what i'm shooting for all right thank you okay thank you by the way captain i know your captain in the navy or retired i mean it's okay i appreciate the service thanks for coming on okay did you know your hand up by the other citizens yes come on john hanson 103 22nd street i was unable to attend the work session but i listened to the tapes and i heard something in there very disturbing as a citizen attendant taxpayer and one who has taken the note multiple times in my life it was related to the quote basically being well this is why we have liability insurance and it went to rules or circumventing or disregarding established law rules ordinances whatever for the information of the citizens our liability bond or insurance is only one million dollars so hypothetically if somebody on a council or the council did something wrong and a citizen and the citizens sued for two and a half million and one who do you think is responsible for the other million and a half we are that's not what we elected people to do is to certainly ignore the oath of office and i take serious offense with that yes i listen to the audio tapes don't look at this dumb foundation section 9.02 is the oath of office for this city basically it says you score a note upon the defending constitution the united states the state of florida and all laws and ordinances you don't flagrantly disregard the law because you don't like it i'm saying if you can't consciously do the job that you swore no to you don't belong up there thank you thank you mr hansigan thank you for the service i'm gonna make sure i get it right command master chief of the name in the navy right in the navy thank you you're welcome captain zabel back there maybe you guys said anyone else yes sir [Music] [Music] close loaded did you hit the button maybe is it green hello there you go okay uh phil booth 2611 betty shore unfortunately this isn't my first time complaining about this but i've had discussions with lynn the house next door to me has had a dumpster in his front yard for five months and the last three months no one has worked on the house and i'm sick of it i mean i paid we pay all pay a lot of taxes and there's a dumpster in our neighborhood right next to my house and no one can figure out how to get rid of it mr booth you put the right night this is the first time that we've had our code officer i had our invitation come here i know that so we're going to ask him about your situation and find out why what's the situation i mean the house has been vacant for two years i believe the owner the actual owner of the house has died it's in court you know the person taking care of the place is in california and could care less what the place looks like the dock is falling into the into the into the water and i have to look at this every day and everyone that goes up and up goes up my street looks at it every day and yet a neighbor line is was redoing the house and he got cut a code violation for trying to improve his house in a matter of two days and this thing has been there for four months and i'm tired of people complaining without identifying themselves no booth 2611 bayshore and i have a complaint i'd like to see the other person that they complained about my neighbor trying to do better on his house and make the neighborhood nice and and have asked him why it's ridiculous yeah second thing is where are our police in the morning on on bel air causewa on the beller bridge it says 35 miles an hour today i've walked the bridge every day please say hello to me or beat when you walk drive by at 60 miles an hour i watched a car pass two cars today and nothing the police aren't around we could make a ton of money we could have enough money to do more lawsuits if they just tag people for driving crazy on that road so that's it okay one second here um let me give you a piece of information i'm gonna ask the police because they're coming up next okay once we finish the citizen comments and all right [Music] one sheriff's officer will give us our report on the regular crime sheriff i'd like you to address the speeding issue and uh and uh danny doherty our code enforcement deputy um he will talk about the reinforcement on the dumpster issue let me give you one piece of information with regarding to these anonymous complaints that used to be a problem in fact it was a problem statewide because citizens used it sometimes to get even with people and like you say you know you got a good guy he's getting busted you thank the governor and the legislature on this one they passed an ordinance that took a law that took effect and now all code complaints need to be identified so there is no more anonymity who was that guy who was the person that turned no the ones that started after they passed the law so that's it's a recent thing i believe it yeah yeah well how long ago july well this was done after july okay and the guy was never a you could never find that identity so i'd like i'd like to know that gentleman's name and turn jeff in so it was before july 1st what it was before july 1st somatics any other citizens i just [Music] across the street of two concerns uh last meeting we spoke at length you guys spoke at length about the crane on the 12th street access yet and and to mr hansik's uh comments about the interns i'm totally in agreement with you on that excuse let me interrupt you patty hold the timer rabinakis arrive at 6 29. okay please continue but um we when this sign was installed out front i have pictures i have video no one was there supervising it number one number two there there were only homes immediately behind the truck not blocking the sidewalk so all the people they started at sun because i'm up burning and um the um there was no blockage of the sidewalk no blockage coming into the parking lot or anything and we had just talked about the danger and they had a big crane to put that thing in so to me that's negligence and i believe that we should be supervising things a little better with those things my other comment is that i noticed on the agenda that we are going to give a certificate under something for the mass for the handicap to access the beach and i'm all for that believe me but i also believe that maybe the city could do something for the beach accesses because um autism cancer those are all disabilities as well so we who have those types of disabilities or autoimmune disorders or whatever need protection at the beach as well not only access to a protection of it and we have just as much right to access the beach at these street accesses as we do in our city that's it thank you thank you um before you go uh let me see if the city manager wishes to comment with regards to the sign installments interior well there was i was out there i was out there maybe not when you took your pictures there were cones around the truck the side front and back it was not blocking any sidewalk and this sign was put [Music] in and kyle and i were out there i know two or three times okay i i got a camera on my house shoots it all but anyway the um cones were very close to the truck there was nothing blocking off that sidewalk it didn't need to be because the truck wasn't blocking the side no not for the truck what if something had fallen the crane wasn't operating towards the sidewalk if it was operating i got videos i mean i felt i felt when i was over there that it was a danger [Music] and i was leaving town for the day but the day before there what got me upset was they were welding out there with no shield around and if you ever get welders at night you'll know it about 2 a.m i just think it's sloppy let me ask you this you you have video that you don't have to and certainly not ready requirement are you able to share any of that with us and send that to us at any point you can send it to um any one of us or you can send it to all of us or you can send it to any generation can be distributed to everyone that will become a public record and then we can see what you saw and that would be great then we can deal with this again anyone else as far as crane i had to come in here to get a book out of the mailbox and there was no spotter out there the cones were just be in place and they were being placed right next to the unit i actually caught i had pictures as well okay there was no spotter there was no one supervising there was a god looking up at the crane there was not a second party i witnessed it all into this parking lot to get that book and coming back out and quite frankly i was pretty intimidated having a cream up in the air and i have a convertible so i was very intimidated about that with no backup security system i'm not saying they weren't here at some point in time i did not witness that and i was not watching her all day long so i can't speak today the other thing this city passed a resolution i believe that they were not involved in the umbrella lawsuit against bill are short okay so for the gentleman that was questioning that the city said they passed a resolution now there were some council members that voted against it obviously and then of course the mayor had to staying from the vote on it because it is lawsuit that's the other thing third thing i want to make sure that i personally witnessed the cardboard putting on one heck of an event this weekend and i personally think they did a fantastic job and i i saw so many children from this city participate and it was very heartwarming and i think this city needs to readdress the fact that we do have children and we need to be their voice as community as a community and start putting more money into this park out here for our children to enjoy we want to be a premier city we want to retain our citizens who know your neighbors you know we need to step up our game and do things to make it desirable to make them want to stay stay in our city we have neighbors that have been here grew up here and are still here and they're raised in the next generation and i think that this is something that this city needs to address thank you thank how many other you like to speak saying no other hands online closes and comments next we have the presentation of pinellas county sheriff's office i'm going to ask that the patrol sheriff make first presentation and then code officer or code officer and if you just introduce us yourself so everyone knows who you are good afternoon corporal killman the mustang sheriff's office these are the stats for september 2021. there are 821 events in the city uh 200 and 500 traffic stops there were nine suspicious persons nine voting vessel stops six uh violations which resulted in seven arrests there are no crashes sheriff i note that one of the things is a motor vehicle theft and every this is available to all citizens if you sign up in the county there's a you get a blast from the sheriff telling you on real time this is september but this is telling us what happened like last week and everything it comes every week thank god most of the times it says nothing for about our beach i noticed that there was some another motor vehicle uh in our city it just happened i guess last week is that is that you know anything about that one that won't show up to the next one but um there was another it looked like there was another motor vehicle they have to be having a group of people maybe going around just want to alert the citizens so i got to tell everyone make sure you lock your car doors do not break actually into the cars you just walk around trying partners and you can take your wallet [Music] here that you know keep things locked up and uh you know because we know that's an epidemic they just go around those doors it's called lifting i think and you know if you happen to have it unlocked they can lift all the stuff inside too and that's not good and the bad thing is unfortunately some people leave firearms and that's great to have firearm protection 100 second amendment but don't leave it unlocked in a car i think we had a sheriff's deputy killed a couple years ago because of that so yeah yeah hang on sheriff one second let's any questions from the council citizens yes uh mr booth so mr booth had the the question regarding the um well patrols on the bridge is the main question right now correct like i said are out of 221 uh events in city 205 which led the max were the max pistons in the city so unfortunately it only resulted in 32 traffic stops taking citations but i just asked uh deputy dortmund to enable a uh direct patrol for the bridge in the morning if there any particular time going to have it warm besides it's 6am all right i'll make it from six to eight sounds good and i see you at 4 45 every morning you got about two or three cars not only there out there right uh i know our we sit at the and we're not going to disclose the date but libraries knows exactly what you can tell me what i'm going to say right now right then okay so we started something um not too long ago where we had special patrols it was because i was noticing a lot of speeders on gulf boulevard we were getting complaints on 22nd street people were coming racing doing stuff so we had undercover officers we paid for this separately but we've got some money set aside for this okay it's been a long time since we've done that okay and we usually try and keep it until we get to the height of the tourist season and everything but we're here we have a citizen who's observed it he's out every day on the bridge okay um and i'll tell you i'm cool i got one time okay i got a call from citizen the first time we did it and it's great because i'm not gonna tell you how we do it but you'll never know it until you're pulled over okay and he goes you know that's really sneaky of you guys you had a you know you caught me coming off the bridge and i was doing like 55 and i'm like i'm sorry what were you doing 55 it's a 35. you know i like going fast too but that's the wrong place to be going fast because you come right into a residential neighborhood so um we're not going to have that so when how about it you know what i'm talking about yet okay every morning okay on our channel 95 from across the bridge this month good i've seen a couple high-speed car chases up and down gulf boulevard there was a couple nights the sheriff was in hot pursuit on a few cases so um it's it's wild out there you know so keep it up you guys are doing a wonderful job we appreciate it very very much this ladies gentleman is danny doherty our uh deputy dougherty uh and um danny doherty's been our code enforcement officer now for about a year and a half or so a monthly report uh so that he can hear from the council with any questions that we have and also hear from the citizens so what we're going to do is i know we've had some people speak from the seats i really can't have that so if we're going to have anybody wants to speak we'll have the sheriff will we qualify for citizen comments sheriff will step aside he's speaking to the mic this way it gets captured on the mic he'll go first we'll ask the questions and i'll open it up for city uh citizen questions and comments deputy donald i'm making you a corporal whether you like it or not because we acted behind it many years ago good evening everyone first of all apologize to my parents i'm covered in cement dust from earlier today so before i address my coaching and the stats that could be related i can answer some of your questions um the traffic enforcement all of our deputies including the builder beach deputy during the school hours are assigned to monitor the school stop on gulf boulevard and elsewhere one of those resulted in one of those stolen car arrests the vehicle spins um basically through the red light on the red sign on the bus uh deputy ali exedy um on day shift early in the morning uh made a traffic stop right in front of bella beach they were occupied by three um subjects uh the car was boarded stolen out of county and everybody went to jail so that's one of them in one example for one second do you know how that report of that came in about the school board buses being run i'm assuming uh that lady right in the middle there she was advanced when captain liner was here we were talking about code enforcement she came up and she she was up i don't wasn't me i was sleeping but at like 5 30 6 o'clock in the morning when the kids get on the bus she heard it a couple times with horns beeping that's what they'll do when they run it and she goes i've heard it two or three times and captain miner made a note of it and obviously got it out to the you know the deputies and that resulted in a nice arrest so thank you citizens and we do listen and so do our sheriffs so pleased and uh before i go further i'm to address mr truth truth's complaint about the 2601 bay shore the green dumpster city manager and i have had communication and we're definitely working on it one thing i didn't i apologize to uh to lynn uh late friday or friday would be right before i get off work um and over the weekend i i received a phone call from the contract apparently a new contract i'm not sure you've got that information but i wanted to deal with it today before i came in and just got busy this uh this contractor i've got his information um he's dealing with a sister apparently with one that's controlling the property he lives out of state he's very motivated to get everything done uh he's gonna be working on the permitting process coming in and doing what he's done computer-wise i i became involved on october 6th when there was a dumpster without a cover on it which is awarded this violation left the courtesy notice to no avail because nobody's there somehow you've got the information uh that there was a violation of this on the door on the victim house he in a timely manner put the cover on the dumpster and he's working on trying to get this house back into shape so we should see some progress on that and [Music] so okay i just noticed that uh on my activity sheet that you have and i apologize um the last pages the dates are marked out i guess if there's a probably clear issue i'll make sure that's corrected for the next month for the month through the month of october when we started our 20 hours a week from eight hours a week and i can break it down we basically we had 101 new violations 57 of those were corrected that day what i do from that point on i follow up by communicating with the citizens out of those 100 out of the remaining ones i resolved 55 during that month there were 55 clothes that i did follows on 41 of those resulted in closure so it's constant i've got open cases and communicating with citizens and trying to get the result as quickly as i can out of those 101 i broke down in the columns ucsc the letter c that means citizen and there were a total of six new citizens during october but a lot of those cities in that column are the categories of follow-ups so even though it's a follow-up citizen a base complaint just for your information so you can see that a little better because i know that's concerned too how many citizens are compared to proactive enforcement then to break down there's a lot of there's a lot of information in the spreadsheet um which can be broken down in various ways but during the month of october uh the four major categories of activity uh consists of the most were permanent checks which i initiate myself when i see work being done in a house i'll make sure that there's a permit posted on the property and it's they're working doing what they should be doing according to them out of those 19 16 16 of those residents had proper permits i did follow-ups on three of them where they had to go get a copy of the permit or they're still the process which they did um two of the three comply there's one still outstanding where for whatever reason he's just not facing another property which i'm dealing with that's uh that's my that's probably my most significant activity compared to everything else the next significant is landscaping issues and a total of 14 of those they're landscaping related i can bring them down into like seven different categories the most are basically uh overgrown grass and weed six seven inches in height and um i'm pretty successful in getting closure on that out of those out of those that were just five done a month and required me to make nine different follow-ups to get people applying today and landscaping uh it breaks down into things one was a visibility you come out to go boulevard you can't see upcoming bicycles or butters because the bush is too too thick and within a couple of days and gentlemen cut it looks pretty good so other ones are overgrown hedges um there were two cases where there were hazardous trees people complained about dead trees to require the landscaping to get those down to the baby [Music] and the next item um of significance would be um parking on the grass or landscaping a lot of residents will park on their grass or um shell electrolytes with rock landscaping and a lot of them don't uh don't realize it's a violation and i'll communicate with them and there's a repeat violation we'll will one of them actually receive a citation because i think might have been the third time of being born and we went to a citation but primarily i mean the majority of people comply and they understand the ordinance and then finally the most significant thing would be um dumpsters without covers on it um okay that would probably be kind of make sure where it saw the redux and pointed out as well and we're trying to work with the uh the property on the kit and compliance that's pretty much it i have a few questions for you and corporal if this is yours or well maybe it's both of yours just jump in okay um you know our city's concerned about parking on the grass but you know the car's off the street and i don't want cars to park on the grass that's against our code it's unsightly it's terrible our city doesn't go for that we've got a much greater problem and i don't see regular enforcement we have landscape vehicles and delivery trucks that routinely park in the turn lane on gulf boulevard we have been given excuses like our trailer is too big and we can't pull it into the gigantic oceanfront estate across the beach across the street i'm sorry maybe you should bring a smaller trailer okay someone's going to get killed we have personally experienced trying to make the turn onto our street trying to get into the turn lane and you've got this gigantic landscaping trailer before you can't make the turn anymore and if you do make the turn you're going blind i don't know whether it comes in as a code or regular police and it's not just our city i remember seeing newspaper articles in the bee that you know this is in readington it's all up and down gulf boulevard and you know these are not small places across the street i understand it's a quick delivery but you know when you're going those turn lanes are there for a reason you're not supposed to park and block a traffic lane that's a major fine and what are we doing about it before someone gets killed well i know exactly what you're talking about um i can address that with our command staff reference enforcement [Music] beach communities as well and i communicate with my my fellow deputies who do the same and there's always delivery drivers that's doing that all the way up through the entire beach communities and then i know you talked about with these landscapers where they're claiming you know they can't work anywhere else and they're blocking driveways or whatever this is kind of they think it's the lesser of the evils so we can look further into that and uh we don't the council doesn't direct you the city manager we're just throwing this information out there but it's not the first time we've called i know other people have called on it the excuses that you usually get from the landscapers are delivering people in lane you know we can't get in the gate then you don't get a long cut okay these are gigantic drivers i could put my driveway twice into their driveway i can pull a trailer in there and i don't drive one regularly it's not hard then they sometimes say well we'll just park in bel air beach no you won't do that okay the landscapers who work at bella regional park in delaware beach camp park and bella beach walk across the street that's inappropriate okay um that's that the other question i have for you deputy is in terms of what this you may need from this council or any issues that you're having is there anything that you need from this council any problems that you're experiencing that the council a week at some point i'll ask you how that 20 is whether it's too much too little or just right but i think it's too early probably at this point to tell i would guess right i mean i do note that there's a lot more code issues over here that have been found with more time which makes sense any questions on the council okay hi everyone um obviously we have a new additional turn lane um going from golf onto the causeway i've had two residents reach out to me and say it's not going to work so i did an experiment the other day i hopped in the inside or the middle lane and and made a left turn to where i would have to merge there is not enough room i was i was going to wait and bring this up during your your time but there is not enough room to make that left turn and i'm wondering if you've noticed the same thing that it's just you have to turn so sharp to make that left if you're in the left lane you naturally drift right into the merge lane um i almost got clogged i know it's gonna happen um do you think that that was the best fix i i thought the i thought the uh just as long as the other motorists are being courteous that they let you know but you know that's not always the case not on our perspective i was wondering who was that is that the got that just did that on their own manager was in contact with them right they didn't do that they studied it but we approached them right yeah we got the intersection report and the city council got it and the county did that for us and part of their uh plan one of the one of the things with the intersection report was to take that uh island out the trees and we're just kind of on whole to look at that further i think there's some flashing light issues with you know it stays right now i've got a calling to the county about that so it looks to me like either you where the thick line is where where you tell the cars to stop at it it probably needs to be moved back towards the island um i think that that that might help the problem there is just not enough there's not enough room to make that left turn without crossing over into the adjacent way that actually actually makes sense and i was open-minded you know can i understand the reasons why they did that and then i'm on the [Music] that's what i wanted here thank you any other council questions citizens do you have any questions for our code officer or our deputy i'm sorry yes please come on and i'll just ask the sheriffs just to step aside briefly and then they'll answer the question in the microphone i'm mike kelly 2740 hibiscus drive west i have a question if you deputy darn you said that you do check for permits to make sure there's construction permits from accounting for these jobs that you see under construction do you ever interact with the actual subcontractors on the job i did one today i'm going to have you answering my company is that is that the question mr kelly what's the dirt the reason i'm asking that is i'm vice chairman of the pinellas county construction licensing we have a full step of investigators that go around and just check with contractors that are out on the streets park doing work at various locations all over the county if they're found not to have licenses if they're found not to have a number of licensed numbers on their vehicles first line's 500 if they're on the license and they don't have numbers on their cards it's a thousand dollars our investigators are spreading them but we wanted with the sheriff for an awfully long time and we thought we'd give it to you 100 and i don't know if you are interacting at all with my investigators on the licensing thank you mr kelly definitely dory thanks billy actually um i wouldn't want to get your contact information too and i would love to interact i have not yet specifically interact with the investigators but i'm constantly interacting with contracts and subcontractors that they won today uh they were carrying a driveway out along the side of the big there's a big trailer uh the guy's sawing the the driveway through rebar it's a total mess of course i'm gonna stop out and check with them and um the the contractor was uh had just left and he mistakenly had the permit with him in his possession of the truck uh my advisor had to be posted on the property is that correct yes so he's gonna have it tomorrow he just and i was able to get that information and verify that he did actually have the correct permit so i'm constantly doing that but the more resources i have the community exchange information yeah the purpose of our board is find unlicensed contractors an awful lot of contractors because labor is very difficult to find by using unlicensed contractors if those guys know that in bel air beach they're being checked to find out if that you guys are watching them and then our investigators i will start sending them to bellaire beach then we're going to find that the contractors themselves will not go using unlicensed contractors and those guys will be fined immediately on site i didn't know if you ever have the authority to say you'd better make sure you're licensed we did thank you great thank you in fact further i've actually sat through some of those uh hearings been quite impressive any other questions by citizens thank you both thanks i do have one for any non code related law enforcement related uh deputy alex dean got off board at 6 pm and she wanted to relay her sentiment uh pinellas county sheriff's office does a fundraiser i'm not trying to listen to anybody trust that's not me but uh this is incredible events called right above the stars um it's a it's an event down to fort de soto first saturday of every december and it basically raises money for victims children victims of children victims of crimes or extremely needy kids that we'll never have at christmas so our deputies go and shop for them um several weeks before christmas and we deliver to the parents they give us a list and so forth um one other way is if uh someone would decline um other than just donating money they can actually adopt a family they work with our staff in our victim advocate division and they have more personal involvement with with assisting the family if they're able to do so what i'll do you can always contact me but i've got a contact number here i'll leave there's a table back there's a presentation maybe if we have a few that we could leave at the front counter for the city hall absolutely the event itself um it's basically bicycle walking running family walks because you don't have to be an athlete to do it um it's it's fully catered uh down the floor um our helicopter flies into santa claus it brings up toys all the kids are lined up probably to 200 deep um it's the weather's incredible it's a great outdoor event for such a great cause i just wanted to okay thank you let's see what we can do about publicizing that for you okay thank you that takes care of the presentation by the sheriff's office and the coded officer item four is the presentation of a disability achievement center um we have jody armstrong former mayor she called me and she's director of the outreach for the beach mobility mats so without further ado ms armstrong thank you mayor welcome fellow council members last week i did a presentation to the very island government council and vice mayor inviting me to speak before you today i represent disability trainer my director of outreach we're the center for independent living serving pinellas and pasco we serve people of all ages and all disabilities our goal is to overcome barriers to independence one in seven people have a mobility impairment one in seven people cannot get to our beaches today for nearly three years uh actually december eighth will be the three year mark that the pinellas county council for persons with disabilities was launched it is a council or an advisory council to the board of common commissioners for all things disability related and i share that committee the very first meeting treasure island brought their brought their mobimet their beach access mat out they did a presentation showed the benefits of it the ease of care and it made a lot of sense because it enabled not only people who use wheelchairs to access the beach it's anyone with a mobility impairment if you have a bad knee a bad hip you're aging into disability maybe you've got vertigo you're not steady on your feet moms with everybody strollers treasure island uses this map so for the last nearly three years i've been advocating up and down the beaches trying to encourage uh municipalities in the county to install these access mats where they make the most sense and earlier this summer another organization called help us gather it's another organization that works with people with disabilities they one of their members got a modeling job for surf style surf shop in clearwater beach and this young gentleman uses a wheelchair and they did the photo shoot on moby mat and treasure island and would help us gather found that they thought that was the neatest instance slice spread and they had a um uh bay news and i did a piece on them and so i called the founder because i i've been working on this project for a long time and i said you know robin we just got to get people out to the beach you know how many times you get the family coming down from up north to see grandma and grandpa and grandma and grandpa stay on this on the seawall and say see you later just like you guys you can't even go out there without an umbrella that just that blows me away speaking of people with disabilities whoa actually i can go on that one but i won't um so we got to talking and she says well you know we have a family foundation and this kind of project for access can really make a difference for us here in pinellas county why don't i fund them i don't know i'm a grant writer when i have somebody say why don't i fund them i never get that well the press release went out and we found the interest because everyone that i went through and said hey would you please put one down and now i'm able to go and say hey let's do this now each of you has a map in front of you and there are currently four access mats in pinellas county and 15 proposed in pinellas and four in pasco the forward foundation will pay for all of them and uh and including the permit so right now we have uh we had a a meeting a zoo meeting with all of the interested parties uh earlier in october uh it included anyone who would already raise their hand say yes please count me in i'd like to have a man on my beach and uh fdep fwc we had representatives from nick descendant's office from linda cheney's office everybody's on board with this so that now the permitting process is not over burdensome i even have an engineer who's willing to do the drawings furball now so we've got all the pieces in place and we are walking through the steps now of the permitting process madeira beach is ready to go and what i'm lining up is madeira beach had some questions on theirs and they were waiting for the questions to come back because that would give us insight as to what else they what else fwc or fdep might want so now that they have their answers we're working through everyone else and we should see these permit applications going in with it by the end of the year every everyone should have their permit applications in the permitting process is going to take some time they've already told us it's going to be months so we're trying very hard so my question for bel air beach is do you have an access point that you would like a beach mat on and if so all you have to do is send an email to info help us gather dot org and say hey we'd like to be included that's all they're asking you have to ask and uh the foundation will uh they understand the process they understand what we're going through what we're doing all the steps that we're taking and the way that it'll work is that once the permits are approved automatically the the foundation will write a check to the city to write a check to the uh the map provider and that's really all it's going to the only thing they want you take care of the map for as long as it's it's in use which should be five to seven years you have to take it up during hurricanes and each one of these roll-up mats is this each section is about 48 pounds and uh they want you to put a sign off on saying that's what this map is for mobility purposes and to include the three logos for disability achievement center help us gather and forward foundation that's it i've never had an easier friend in my life so if it's not right for you guys i understand it's okay but i do encourage because we're all one accident or illness away from being a person with a disability and i moved here because of that sand most of us moved here because of that sand and i would really like to see everyone who can to be able to get out there so there's lots of apps for everyone everybody wants one and you've got my card reach out to me i will work with you every step of the way first thank you for coming and you're doing a great great thing here and um it sounds very exciting um we can't just give you an answer tonight but we'll have a work session coming up in a couple of weeks and i'm gonna ask how to put this on um we can get a consensus right there we're only asking for normally asking for an email but there may be other questions we probably will be able to actually bring it for a resolution until december but that's not that long so that grant will still be here in case okay we have one public beach access we have several beach walkovers but our main beach is is morgan park now i'm mayor of this city but there's another city across the street that makes up 19 blocks that bellar beach uses that's bel air shore they have commission meetings usually later in the month that's what we were talking about earlier the 6th street 12th street and 19th street access points all the bellering residents who live in those areas use that so they may be interested in that also i'm not sure what kind of a cell you're going to have to get them but it's worth making that presentation there too so that all the citizens no matter where they may be in the city you know they'll have to travel to morgan park exactly convenience i don't have a picture of this do you have a picture or something that you might be able to send us sure what they look like you know i've never seen i don't think i've seen them i do yeah um actually moviemat is the uh vendor that we have been working with that poor man i took him up and down these beaches for the last two and a half years measuring walking and giving uh [Music] you're walking right through that fine line um as disability disability achievement centers the center for independent living we are strong advocates for persons with disabilities and um i don't know i i really believe you should be accessible absolutely everybody should ask them to enjoy this beauty and enjoy them safely i thank you so much we are going to have you know even even if you don't if you choose not to there's still going to be enough to put in alex county make pinellas county the most accessible beaches in the in the state i can't say the world in the state new england has quite a few of them but this is a statewide effort there are many many musicalities around the state that are trying to do this naples has done a study they're trying to put one in every half mile but they don't have the funding we are the only county that has the funding so what we're going to do as soon as we get these down we're going to visit san diego to promote disability tourism that's a huge industry that's untapped and we've got the world's most beautiful beaches why not the most accessible we're the perfect fit thank you very much thank you for your great work all right that concludes the regular part here we're going to move into the consent agenda council will be doing okay we've been here for an hour and ten everybody's all right i'm not hearing any issues okay adam bob you're doing five six seven eight all part of the consent agenda we have approval of the september 20th 2021 city council work session minutes these were tabled from the october 4th meeting at my request um there were amendments that were requested today so those were made fine i'm happy with it um item six is approved october 4 2021 city council meeting minutes then item 7 is approval of october 18 2021 city council work session minutes the number eight is approval of city council monthly invoice for uh i'm sorry city attorney monthly invoice for legal services so we're going to approve items five six seven eight first i need a motion motion by frank banker second second by david gaddis they're gone correction yes um on item number six the october 4th meeting um item number nine eight nine and ten it says that removed from the regular agenda they were actually moved from the consent agenda to the regular agenda this is pages four and [Music] but then as you go further down on the next page on page four regular agenda approval of the septembers that moved from the right of the agenda from the consent agenda to the regular agenda right so i'm not sure i'm following what the issue is [Music] um said she could make that correction yeah um it's material council number two my issue is that's a consent agenda we're not even supposed to discuss it so let me okay hang on we're gonna get it right because if this happens again please move that item out of the consent agenda but i'm not going to get hung up on a technicality here does the council have any problem with amending this on the fly like this this is a minor this is to just keep the minutes proper we have any objection we have none okay we'll do that so how do you familiar with exactly the changes yes i've already changed it thank you all right so other than those changes we're good all right then so on the motion right now is to approve the consent agenda um and that is items five six seven and eight i'll read again the s vote will approve this approval of the september 20th 2021 city council work session meeting minutes 6 approval of october 4th 2021 city council meeting minutes item 7 approval of october 18 city council work session minutes and item approval city attorney monthly invoice for legal services i'll take a voice vote all in favor this is consideration of appointment to the board of adjustment this is a city council uh vote by ballot to fill vacant warranty uh [Music] council will you dispense with your comments until you get after we heard from mr gabriel scouts i totally gave 2228th in auto drive um i'm really just uh here to help the community it's um i think we should all do whatever we can to participate and i've got about 40 years doing type of research here in pinellas county cities counties state attorneys title companies i think i can bring that knowledge to the board of sit hang right there and see if there's any questions from the council while you're here okay on this way you can answer back and forth okay council do we have any questions uh i know mr gatlin and i think he would be a great addition to the board of adjustments mr catwoman i don't know you i've seen some some writings in your stuff and it concerned me a little bit and i i you know i i wouldn't say it's something that i would say i i certainly i see your background you certainly have an excellent background i think you'd be fine for the board i am a little concerned about some of the writings we hear earlier when we were speaking about this whole each umbrella issue and what was going on yes there was and i'm reading some of the stuff that you wrote and it's direct contrary to what the law and the facts are so i want you to understand and you might know this already but i want to say this for anybody who serves on this board and mike kelly's here he'll confirm this i know i'm right on it this is what's called quasi-judicial board you don't report to us actually the next line of review after you make your decisions court they look at what you do so if an applicant comes before the board of adjustment your decision is final you speak for the city that's why you're a judicial board and that calls marrying the facts to the law and my concern is some of the stuff that i'm reading here is directly it's incorrect some of the stuff that he posted out on facebook okay i'll tell you beach umbrella's basically your idea that the city can make whatever all it wants that's not correct and you heard about the constitutionality you heard about when it gets even more detailed when we start getting into the what the deeds themselves say in terms of our perpetual rights then you get into this the whole this whole issue which isn't even formed yet in the court about this whole constitutional right to the wet sand and the recreation that they don't you know do it's not simple and the only reason was and then there was another one another comment on when the city cut down uh butchered the ucos which still haven't grown back and we said there was no laws violated well i've got the ddp report that wasn't all violated okay we're not supposed to cut them that well and it was an error a bad error and it's never gonna happen again and i don't want to give this information to the citizens i don't doubt that you want to help citizens but i will caution you that you know what you're going on is that this board everything that you do on this board is subject to review so if someone doesn't get that variance and they don't like what they say or somebody writes something you know now the city goes to well you know they go to take the city to court and it starts looking ugly so that's all i want to say those comments are on social media yes everybody shares their opinions and their frankly their first amendment right to speak their mind but i appreciate your comments council i'm gonna come to the uh to the citizens right after council any other council comments or questions from mr gableth now let's open it up to the citizens we have mike kelly um again if i'm just gonna have to step just right in the doorway there let's have my kelly speak and then if you need to answer it or rebut it you get the mic again mayor yes and and uh councilmember gunn would like to speak when you're ready okay i'll take him what we'll do is i'll take him right after this and then i'll go back to other citizen comments mike's here standing here so let's have mike if clinton doesn't have a problem with that mr gunn no problem no once again i'm mike kelly i'm speaking in this capacity as the current chairman of the board of justice i'm here actually to let you know that on a personal level and a pleasure level i have been i have known tony gatlin for over 27 years i had the privilege of serving with him and participating with him on a very successful men's softball league back in the 90s tony is very dependable man he's a very dedicated man and he's a man of character so i'm here to endorse this appointment toward worth just that dark world adjustment is also an award that has to be dependable has to be credible and has to be careful because what what the issues are before us um it is very respectful of our citizens and i would i would hope that you knew a point mr gatlin that he would be a good addition a respectful person his character is what i'll mention thank you very much thank you want to disagree with any of that mr yeah no i wouldn't have though that i think that was the best third patient that's going to ask you what position did you play so you have a good arm all right third glenn you have the floor thank you yeah i just want to say that uh tony has my trust in confidence i think he's a uh a person of character and i think some of the comments we made on social media or direct response to a lot of misstatements and misconceptions and and just flies thickness uh i'm i'm very surprised while i agree with mayor bonzo's comment as well as mr kelly's comments said board members must remain impartial i'm surprised we're having this conversation now that is speaking right when a sitting member of a board was on social media when you know events taking place and uh espousing a lot of misperceptions and misinformation and again i'm just very surprised we're having this conversation now or we're assuming new member and we never had this conversation where we had this issue has developed into the room before so i i'm fully in support of uh bringing aboard mr nelly i think person [Music] [Music] so um everybody has a right to give information but this is attributed to you and if it's not you please tell me tony gable of bellaire beach didn't the umbrella hoopla teach us that the land to the mean high water mark is private land that's not correct um if so then no laws are broken this is in regard to the seals the has nothing to do with the bean hog watermark it has to do with what's known as the coastal construction control line which in our city is pretty much equal to the retaining wall which is why there was no violation on 6th street but there was partial violation a lot of violation on 12th street complete violation on 19th street and complete violation on morgan street i've got the florida dvp report here and i'm not going to read it into the record but it talks about the violations over here so again anybody has the right to write whatever they want okay but if we're going to help the citizens which i don't doubt that you really do want to do okay i want to help them with the right information that was bad what happened that was destruction of our beautiful seacoast and it better never happen again i reported it i'll report it again next time and i am told from ddp we will not get a break if it happens again though cos still haven't grown back and although sixth street was behind the coastal construction line because that retaining wall is actually in front of the dunes if you go there i was just there friday because i was enjoying the high surf and let me tell you the erosion that's there is is significant those seals hold the grasses together and right after those things were cut we had another storm and wiped out a lot of sand and that sand has never come back so i just want to make sure the residents get the right information this report is a public record sitting in patty gentry as it's from florida dp it's addressed to me from july 29th so i don't you go on social media and write whatever you want but again if you want to help the citizens particularly being on the board now you'll be a representative of our city you know i'm just asking that make sure we get our facts straight most of my comments were in response to others who also didn't necessarily have their facts i've seen some of the backdoor next-door stuff thank you for your consideration but thank you for your interest here council if you have any other questions mr gables before we take up our discussion and vote so we have to have a seat we're going to we don't have to go send us out to the election division we do this right in front of you here any other questions before we call the vote patty's given us hey can we use the ones that are inside our uh our binder so inside our binder um we have a vote and now i'll make sure i can say this properly we have one person on the ballot this isn't like north korea though it doesn't say you have to vote for one you may vote for up to one that person is tony gap if a yes vote will get him on he needs the majority of this council to be approaching these four votes please um vote yes or no and hand your ballot to lynn you always do this if you just have to be taller to vote [Music] council member aki voted for mr gatlin councilmember bankerd voted for mr gatlin council member doterra voted for mr gatlin council member voted for mr gatlin vice mayor gavis did not vote hold on let me look i've got she distracted me it's the hanging shed vice mayor gaddis voted for mr gavlin and mayor manzo voted for mr gallant even with the questionable vote of the vice mayor he wins 7-0 congratulations um you are and you know i saw that we had a thing a little while ago where the city attorney had given some instructions up to one of the groups i think you were on the group because i was looking at it um about sunshine law and stuff like that you i think you're familiar with that right the sunshine laws and you can't speak outside the board of business like you can't speak to mike any more about the board other than we've got to be on tuesday or something like that if there's any questions fred reilly here is the city attorney you can always ask him but it's always better to ask in advance than to do something and find out that you violated the law florida's very strict essentially you can't talk about anything other than like do we have a meeting on tuesday you can't say hey i really think that's a great idea we should give that guy the doctor can't do that mr kelly councilmember gunn i'm sorry would you hold that up again okay mayor manzo yes i didn't count mr uh council member gun he voted for mr broward okay so council member gunn how do you vote he held up his vote it's for mr gatlin okay so it is seven to zero the second corrected vote still has he is the winner you only need four anyway so even if someone challenges it we got it so still congratulations mr kelly yeah your comment was correct about sunshine laws and proper training we had in march as most of you know a board of adjustment training session since that time we have the council has appointed three new members the board of adjustment it might be worthwhile for us as a board when if you and i can do another training session in the next six months it will be good for the council to pay a board of justice members that have already heard it once but for three new city members it will give them more confidence in the upcoming year you can see if i can dispense with this right here okay um council he's made a proposal we don't need a resolution for this i think it's a great idea i don't think anybody's going to disagree but if we do does anybody have an issue with uh he has three new members that's a that's almost the majority of them we have seven seven rewards right so three three of them have been appointed since march actually since may after our training session in march so i just think it might be strong to do it again fred if you um hang on let me give you the approval first okay so does anybody have a problem with that so now we can fred if you would work out with mr kelly and with uh the city manager but a convenient time i would like to make sure this time that um we can get all three people there so whatever we have to do to make the three work whether it be a saturday morning or whatever a friend loves working saturday morning so um so we'll make it work for everybody here's those three i'm sure we'll be here good suggestion thanks all right let's move on to item number 10. okay all right consideration of ordinance 2102 an ordinance of the city council of the city of baylor beach board of providing for the amendment chapter 86 signs of the city code ordinance providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the amendment of chapter 86 signs the city code ordinance providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for severability providing for the repealable ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date it doesn't say here but patty correctly come along this is the first reading correct first reading we need two before we can pass it um first of all the emotion so second second by leslie and tara dave gaddis uh i will defer to the city of attorney fred riley referring to you any comments on this and by the way folks just to give you a quick background we have been debating this in work sessions for probably five months now so with that mr ryan in the last workshop the city council discussed this at length it was one of a number of as mayor said one of a number of times it's been discussed i made several changes to it that came out of that workshop there are a new definition for activated component and a new definition for activated signs and i changed the reference elsewhere in the chapter 86 to activated sign so that board has been clarified there was a lengthy discussion in the workshop about that was led by city manager reeves about the uh the actual size of the signs and the uh that so that amount was or that that was quantified and the signs will not exceed the temporary signs will not exceed four square feet and those there was another change that leslie matero requested where there was a a sentence that had been repeated twice so one of those was deleted and i really don't think there was that much more that we made in the way of revisions so this is you know other than those couple things i want to say there was one more very minor point but those those are the major things that have changed and that's it's now the court for the city council to to address on first reading first i want to thank you mr riley and i want to thank the city council we have went around and around on this thing not because it's an easy issue because it's a very difficult issue signage is first amendment right okay first amendment rights obviously are you know the cornerstone there's a reason that's the first amendment and not the you know seventh amendment um and you have to be careful in what you restrict and how you restrict it and this was the best compromise that the city council was able to come up with and walk that fine line and the problem with walking the fine line as mr riley has said and as i've said as attorneys um you can't see the line the line's all squiggly the line is all gray and it's dark at night and the courts are all over the place with this stuff so i think a council member had asked you know does this guarantee that we're not going to ever have an issue with somebody bringing a legal issue no it doesn't guarantee anything somebody can always make that challenge fred reilly cites a whole bunch of case laws that when you know the various appellate courts and supreme courts that are all on sign ordinances and stuff so this is the best attempt and i don't want anyone this is the best attempt of this council and i don't want anyone i'll say picked on if it doesn't work out if three years from now somebody says hey there's a problem in there that's not any one of the people's fault that did this you cannot bulletproof this this is way better than what we had okay what we had is the problem in fact it was so bad we actually suspended the enforcement of it so this is a great compromise i will be voting for it and i encourage everyone else to do the same anyone else i appreciate the work you did mr reilly on this i understand your argument mr mayor um the problem is it grew from six pages to 26 pages it's just too convoluted for me i can't support it i understand there could be litigation coming forward but there could be litigation on everything that we do so again no offense mr robbie i think he did a great job but don't take her okay anyone the first round i'm gonna come back dick yes okay no i was uh just going to add that this is many many months in the works many many hours we've spent on this i know it looks a little overwhelming and it is it takes a long time to get through this however in the event that something does come up in the future i believe that anyone would look at this documentation and see we tried everything we could to satisfy the needs of the city and our signed ordinance so i'm for it anyone else on council and an open up to the citizens no other council i'm done that much always hear him does he want to say anything to daddy no he's not holding up her hand okay good so we will go to the citizens then citizens any comments on the sign markets john hansen plays up here john hancick 22nd street i've read through this and it's taken a lot of time it's taken a lot of hard work and as previously mentioned it's really grown but my concern is um there's a couple of things adhere to that question in section 86-64 permitted temporary signs john give us a second to get to that okay sure what page is it it's easier just give us a page page 21 of your back at 21. okay it's a 7-paragraph charlie replacement standard temporary signs and support structures are to be posted not less than eight feet from the back of the curve of a street and should not be posted on or over in the right-of-way or easement i get that this talks about um the boulevard out here and gulfport causing the causeway in uh that part without actually taking the tape measure and measuring from the back of the concrete curve eight feet in puts it on sidewalk for sure if not on private property okay go to the next [Music] page 22 and it would be do you mind if i just hold that best person to ask on this if you don't mind trying to you just brought something up because um you know usually when you don't most of the streets do not have sidewalks so you just take when i get the election you take three paces off the curb and seem to keep me out of lin's hair for most of them so but what about this when we do have a sidewalk how do we handle this when mr uh typically for for us we just use the back of the sidewalk for about 18 from the back of the sidewalk that keeps it because it's in [Music] the the way they come to creature not supposed to put it the right way so if it comes from eight foot back to the sidewalk it's not the right way it's charging now and on the side streets we use a wooden back of the curve because some rivals oh that's not what this says on the next page it says eight feet from a asphalt where's the atmosphere it's under your location it's persons who live on streets other than gulf of the causeway boulevard replace temporary signs and shallow below not low shall not be located closer than eight foot to the paved roadway and shall be placed only on the public property now there's an easement on everybody's property right now that's the word i'll tell you how i do it depends how we're going to consider the valley curve i take it eight feet from the valley curve i think that's the way we write this but you really aren't supposed to be driving the valley curve but it's it's not the pavement but can you say valley curb yeah and see it says back of the curve of the street that's what it says placement standard eight feet from the back of the curve right but then mr hansik alerted us to if you go to the nation's 22 location and under the sub-paragraph two or three well this is actually an exception for the only open house in garage sales so it's not all the other signs that were the temporary signs so there's there's a slight difference for open house and garage sale signs there is a difference between the two i don't think they conflict so maybe somebody needs to clarify with an upcoming election because the way i interpret this you can't have any political signs in the right of way even in front of city hall on election day between a sidewalk and a curb number two you can't have a mountain gulf boulevard because those little wire thingies are not going to penetrate the concrete sidewalk and if you go above the sidewalk you're on private property if i want to put a garage sale sign or i want to put holiday decorations that are temporary in my half moon in front of my house i got to put a meat foot that puts him up under the palm trees you guys need to clarify a little better what you're trying to tell us because basically you're saying here you're not going to violate our constitutional rights but they're extremely limited the way i read this when it comes to the actual placement that's correct okay um and again i'll speak only for myself but i'm pretty sure every candidate did this i didn't hear of any election violations except there were people who stuff in front of city wall that's inappropriate um you're not allowed to post put stuff on the gulf boulevard if you put it on the strip between the sidewalk and the street it doesn't belong there that would be in violation even under our old one if you place it on the grass and i had many on both billboard um and so did other people you need the owner's permission every one of those was with the owner's permission you cannot place it on someone's property um and you had to actually knock on the door and make sure they said it's okay to put it there so no you have no right to place it on anyone's property or vacant law for that matter no i clearly understand that but the way i'm reading this and i was taught very clearly when i wrote policies and procedures in the military to read objectively don't read into it the way i read this ordinance effectively does violate my constitutional rights based on where you you've replaced it well on page 24 under political signs number two it says when you were talking about upcoming political cycle it says all setbacks set forward i've built a political science they may not be less than seven and a half one half feet from the edge of any road service or not less than two feet from any existing sidewalk adjacent to the private cargo and just to be clear i would take a measurement to head measure either from the probably do it from the back of the uh gutter the concrete gutter just to be safe the extra inch several inches so that somebody doesn't come along and take it out of my yard even though it's that edge isn't an easement but it's still i pay the taxes on that we've always allowed the placement of the easement okay because if you didn't i remember quote lynn directly every sign would be like you know because i think you have 15 15 feet in front of every yard or so with eastman so you would actually be 15 feet into you nobody would be able to you might as well not even have science okay so it's always been off of the curb but not to obscure traffic so i didn't have it i mean this to me was clear enough and we do require i mean under uh 86-64 b which is on page 21. it does talk about those temporary side shall be erected on any property whether the authorization of the owner or resident thereof except this provided here so i mean it's if somebody sticks a sign to somebody's property and without authorization you just throw it away right i get that part i'm just talking about me the property owner but again the way i read this as it's written it restricts my constitutional right to freedom of expression that's all i wanted to say i'm just i mean i'm just trying to understand i don't know i think i can explain this i believe that what we've done is we've we've set a rule where he he has no place to put aside is that because too many times but i don't remember where the palm trees are is it because your palm trees are in the way or is it because i guess in my property i have a rounded driveway okay because there's no on street parking right okay on the back side of that circumference if you will is where the palms are and i have one big one in the center it's getting taller [Music] [Music] mayor he's got you know i'm i'm aware of john's and there's a couple other houses he's got landscaping there right now to the wings of his yard there's probably grass areas which he could put a sign there but there's a lot of houses that have that curved with landscaping and yes if you took it seven feet off the curb you might be in the middle of that landscaping and you won't see anything right but that's your landscaping right we give you the option if you i mean you know i hate to say you can put the sign in or you can keep landscaping and you might not be able to do both depending on your standard but we you know i mean the reason why it's seven feet is for safety that's why it's seven feet it's so that you look down the block and you can see if the neighbor's car is pulling out of the driveway because i'll tell you you know coming up to a political season you get a lot of signs on the street and you cannot see down the street so easily as you can like right now but there's nothing out there so that was the whole idea behind the seven seven and a half feet eight feet wherever it is it's really strictly a safety thing but you know your results may vary depending on how your law goes so we'll figure something out any other citizens yes sir okay uh good evening mayor manzo and city council members my name is nicholas michael zabel i reside at 3320 hibiscus drive west i am a student of the public policy and administration program under the direction of just jeff kronshawl at petersburg college i come before you tonight to speak on agenda item number 10 about the city ordinance regarding chapter 86 and science this would be the ordinance this would be the consideration of order 21-02 and ordinance of the city council of the city another you have three minutes i want you to make the most of it we know the ordinance is in front of us we believe we know this one go right into what you want to tell us okay all right we'll do it in its current state this ordinance under the general provisions won't watch it okay in this current state this ordinance regulates how signs of debt city limits may be displayed depending on the type of signage it states when and where the sign may be placed depending on the fund depending upon the type of property it also determines the size of the posted signage under general prodivisions of section 86-61 item number five it states that any sign including its base which is broken or damaged or which becomes unsightly shall be prepared by the property owner or agent of the owner who is responsible for sign what is there in this ordinance that determines the meaning of the word unsightly is it a matter which it is is that a matter which is left between the property owner and the code enforcement in some ways can this be used by members of the city to research freedom of speech because they dislike a sign i believe it to be unsightly while i can understand the importance of being the city looking nice as it attracts more people to move here my main concern is the protection of the citizens freedom of speech i believe that this is something the city council should investigate as being interpreted differently than it was intended which could cause future lawsuits in the future thank you very well said um and now you've given us something else to look at here so you actually had a little bit extra time too so yeah i definitely i think that all i had plenty of no problem we knew what we were talking about if you don't mind staying up there i'm going to you know again we've done a lot of debate on this and this is this gentleman mrs abel you've come forward and highlighted something that even in you know all the readings we've done you know this is how when i say it people say you're being a lawyer well so does he and then you know what i'd rather he do this here than somebody could do it up in federal court so with that said i'm going to turn it over because this is what we have our city attorney for mr riley do we want to make any comments on this and you know he raises an issue here that may require some discussion on that look at your look for your legal guidance on this one the the comment he's made is related to section 86-61 subsection five correct that's correct okay his comment was that regarding really the word once unsightly it's not defined well there's and this is repetitive because i've already said it but we we've spent more than a year uh going over this there have been a lot of things where that have been defined and further defined that was one of the the things that we felt for the council felt and directed me to address was places where there was it would be helpful to have a better definition than the one that we had and we've gone through and and added actually quite a few different definitions the uh word unsightly is um there's a lot of things just so you understand how this was put together there were certain things that uh in the drafting process that were changed and i know this will be good for a laugh but i tried to change as little as i possibly could the thing that was the major change to the ordinance was oriented towards establishing the basis for the city to say we want a ordinance that supports a attractive community and we have standards that will make this an attractive community and i always would use the same example bel air beach and is a residential community and believer beach is not uh us 19 or almost any section that you choose it's simply those are two different worlds so a lot of the stuff that was added was going to show or to to give a basis for why these things are justified based on what the community needs are and what the community standards are and that the city council has debated a lot of those my my legal answer to the question about the word unsightly is if a word is not typically defined in a statute or an ordinance that it's given the normal and customary usage of the word so you know unsightly to most people would mean you know something that's dilapidated or in disrepair or that type of thing ultimately if there's a any action taken it would be typically through code enforcement and if somebody had a code enforcement case which was not being for the city council the special magistrate for the code enforcement hearing would make a determination whether that was unconstitutionally vague or not if the case hinged on that one word i personally am not uncomfortable with the the words which are broken or damaged or which becomes unsightly those to me are pretty good legal standards and most people would have some understanding of what those meant so my answer is i i don't think it needs to be revised further sure i think the key word you need to look at is which or two words is which becomes so at the time it was installed it was not unsightly it became that way later so that that would indicate to me that uh we're looking at wear and tear and my question you know at one point uh is it determined that it becomes unsightly like oh there's you know it's scratched up a tiny bit but it's still you know overall intact but not over you know it's not it's the you know it's the vagueness of that of that word you know anything i need to be considered unsightly if it's mark you know hard weather or whatever so i'm just wondering at what point is it considered on cycling mr zabal i'm going to actually agree with attorney riley and vice mayor uh guinness attorney i don't know if you know that but um i love picking these things apart that's like a hobby of mine but um i don't have a problem with this one and i'll tell you why um and it's a good observation and listen if you're not an attorney you should think of becoming one because this is this is something somebody could challenge you're not going to be able to challenge it because you don't like the message on it because that doesn't make it unsightly and there's a famous supreme court opinion about pornography and they said well what does that mean and the judge said we know it when we see it okay there's a sign i know somebody sends a picture around not too long ago this was out there three years ago when i was campaigning for mayor it was it was rusty it's falling apart it's on an angle i don't know why it hasn't been pulled and stuck in the city hall's dumpster okay um from a vacant lot it's not the same thing okay but then there's new ones i think no we're not a scratch i mean i think that would be unreasonable there's a there's a division of reasonableness if you were here earlier you heard me talking about laws have to be reasonable you know so any sign could have a little bit of weathering but to the point where the lettering is worn off of it or it's rusty or the chain is no longer holding the sign up i mean then we start to get there what's that point i mean there's a lot of things where how much is too much you know i just would have just finished an appeal on how much was too much and you know legal standard in terms of a video that was shown to the jury how much was too much and um it's balancing act that's basically what the court would say it's balancing out so excellent observation i'm okay with it um the way it is right now but um if anybody ever gets nailed on this one and the other thing i'll tell you too is our code enforcement danny doherty is left here but our focus on code enforcement we just had a meeting on this is supposed to be about gain compliance and education so we're not supposed to be the gestapo and we come in and go you don't like your sign and it's getting pulled out and thrown in the truck and you can get it from winners and he's going to charge you 10 bucks that's not a word about you know somebody should come if they think the signs get a little rusty or whatever they should have that discussion with you like maybe throw a little paint on or something like that um that's what it's supposed to work the reason why we're actually doing this because it didn't work that way we had a couple signs that were confiscated in towns and in the town and people came right in there and they were they threatened to sue us but they told us that they could have and they all know they had a point so that's where we're coming from i don't know if it satisfies you i think you still have a good finding here but um i think it's clear enough for at least for me as an attorney mr banker i think he raised a good point i put a frank banker sign out for council you don't like him you throw an egg at it is it on the side with you that's the point i'm getting down what you know like oh i don't like it and if it's you know getting towards that you know definition that you have about sight and if someone reports it as on-site because they don't like kids that's crap i'm getting mad they're gonna have a hard time if they don't like it but you know if a sign becomes uncycling somebody paints it over you might have to frank's gonna have to dig into his campaign treasury and replace that one um but one of the other things that we have here is i mean and this i'm going to say this to the city manager now because it should be highlighted to code we are going to be coming up on elections so you can sit there with mr hansick and his tape measure and get this thing down perfect and make sure you have it exactly right and some landscapers cutting the lawn and he loses your sign he doesn't know our ordinance and it's supposed to be 7.35 feet he doesn't know that okay so code should be about compliance move the darn sign move them around i know i moved a million of them because people get the long term every week and a lot signs move we put them in the right spot the candidates will but other people move them and you know again this is supposed to be about just getting moving where they want now if somebody puts a wall wrong they might might have a little call with that person and say great rule but you know just highlight that because it's not you know somebody's moving they move by accident they don't know but again your science should be confiscated if we do that that's too heavy-handed i will never support that kind of code enforcement doesn't matter i don't think anybody on this council did i don't know if we helped you but you have me raised a good point thank you for your time to help you understand that excellent observation thank you any other citizens yes sir first of all thank you for all this work for you guys i was a trained triathlete the only thing i saw excluded is i think it was trying to deal with on page seven uh roman numeral number nine for bright flashing lights it says lesson you just may want to consider whether putting an amendment in later or just putting in an item now but like i mentioned that the work session is is that photophobia photo bright lights being flashed can cause neurological disorders causing either pencil cases for people with migraines for other people with bipolar disorder and for epilepsy and they've even made cities take off their uh their photo radars because uh it had stimulated uh attacks for people who caught accidents and so i would hate for us to be stimulating any of those neurological disorders because we don't have something in there that keeps us from having the flashing signs of the bright lights add it to this list of and right now all that i see that it says say lesson and my only concern is we don't want to cause an issue we can avoid it right now thank you we do have something on page a thank you um that says to regulate signs so as not to interfere obstruct the vision of or just grab motorist bicycles or pedestrians so could argue that it's under there maybe not as clear as you said it though you know well most people don't realize there's photophobia so that causes neurological disorders i would hate to see somebody get a network right on the street and crash the bridge thank you april thank you any other citizen comments yes to our sign out here out front please regulations in the city depending on the zoning okay so my concerns are that um if you read this there's quite a number um and as mr riley said we're not we're a residential community we're not us-19 so um i'm looking at page seven i mean seven and eight you look at these and it's um number five maintain and enhance the scenic beauty of the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth that concerns me or whether it be putting advertising on or something out there and then number seven minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property we have a number of houses here that border the pond and behind the pond and so i think we need to take a good look at how long that sign is going to be on at night if we're going to allow it to flash messages because that definitely will impact property values it will impact people's ability to sleep because you're going to have a sign flashing in your we're going to have it flashing in our family room window all night long and i don't believe that that will improve my property values i don't believe that the people who live behind the pond in fact i know they won't because i've talked to them their front windows face that and that even the street lights reflect on the pond all the way across the pond i would encourage you all to come over and look at that because the street lights reflect across that time pretty brightly so there's and if you look at page eight um precluded signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the lots and adjoining life well my permitted use is for residential so i would believe that that would conflict with that i just i think that we really need to think about this and put some things in here because we're going to have digital signs on both boulevard in front of the motel uh in front of the beach club and certainly the condos will once they go up in front of the of each condo supermarket because we allow short-term rentals and the advertising later so i would like to strongly suggest that you look at how you're going to regulate digital signs i mean again citizens are raising issues here i know we were hoping to move this to a vote tonight but we want an ordinance that's in good shape here this is legislative intent that she was looking for so override the legislative intent is kind of the idea behind the governing principles that's what we're trying to shoot for okay um it doesn't mean you're gonna hit everyone perfectly but so rather than have you address this because i'll address it by saying that this list of things is what or as he said is a specific legislative attempt to explain the basis for the regulation that follows so this is the predicate for other things and saying what is important within this community a lot of the or the several of the things that you you highlighted could it could it be handled slightly differently of course it could i will say what has been said already several times that city council and i and city manager have spent a year on this and there have been a lot of things that were brought up in work sessions and elsewhere that were debated and this corn ordinance that you have in front of you was what the result is and if if there's further things that the council feels strongly enough to revisit and before you you approve it then the thing to do is not go forward personally i think that's a mistake for for a couple reasons you'll once it's passed there's always an opportunity to amend it any later date if necessary part of the reason to try and get this done now is because there is an election that will be coming up and pretty soon it will be election season and part of the object of doing this was to address how the political signs would be handled and if the city council goes another month or two without passing the ordinance then then you're back in the quandary of how you handle science during the political season so i'm not diminishing in any way shape or form the comments you're making but i'm saying this yet if you read through that very lengthy list of things all those are oriented towards going to court at a later date and saying judge we made every reasonable effort we possibly could to state what was important for our community and why we created these standards that that we did in order to make sure that the aesthetic value of our community is is intact that's what it's for and again you can you could artfully state it a different way but you can always do that and i i can't i would encourage the city council to to uh you're running out of time in my opinion with respect to this because you really need something in place with respect to the political season and i i'm the first one i want the legal standard to be as absolutely clear as it possibly can be and there's you know to be quite honest with you there's always a way to make it uh clarify things but this this is a year's worth of effort to get to this point so that's my response i want to understand two things okay um two things um i agree with fred reilly regarding this political season coming up none of the council members did this but we had a gentleman in this town um ran banners that filled his room you could see him from the waterways okay for a presidential candidate who one wasn't enough the guy put a that's not what the city is looking for we don't want to stop the first amendment right to state a sign not saying vote for president smith but we want to say you know you're not going to put a ban on the size of your roof i mean that that kills everyone's value let me say this about this sign outside here okay as you look at this council here if you started from robert frank banker and myself voted on that sign people over here who have done voted yes that's right now unimportant the sign passed through a democratic process we had a lot of debate it was a good debate really was okay four to three it passed but we were told okay and even being on the minority that that we lost that that sign is not going to flash that sign is not going to be on a lie it is not going to be an eyesore and i'm telling you if it becomes an eye story and that starts happening okay you know how to reach me okay i'll bring that motion i have the right to bring that motion i will not let that happen in this city okay and hopefully we'll get four votes and we'll stop that okay that is not what that sign is supposed to be this is not a car wash it's not a strip club we're not gonna have that in this city okay it's supposed to bleed on and off and i don't know who is driving gulf boulevard and causeway boulevard at two in the morning that needs to know what our next council meeting is okay they could wait till the next day uh as far as that sign should go off at a reasonable hour nine or ten o'clock that's fine i could say eight or nine you may be fine that's fine most of the people in this town are retired the traffic is minimal there but so so i guess my my sarcastic comment is i could put a political sign in my front yard that followed these that was digital because there's one across the street from me um [Music] okay page 17 section 86.5 exemptions this chapter shall not apply to subsection c signs for the benefit of the citizens is authorized by the city manager city council or other government authority having jurisdiction in the state so effectively this chapter does not apply to the street to sign out in front of the community center see that let's see his last paragraph on page 17. well there's another constitution over here if you want to argue we may never get this done i mean you know we're in a residential this is what we're talking about okay it's like 100 correct you're in the same neighborhood you face each other why can't you have a digital sign why can't it be the same size why are we accepting ourselves i mean okay pretty much yes that's what we're becoming so and we can't wait that's there's a constitutional challenge because it's one thing for me to say are you to say frank on your street i want a digital sign you can say well wait a minute you know nobody else has one here she's directly opposite this she's in the same situation other than she's not a government entity but we're exempting ourselves now government entities sometimes exempt themselves so you know this is this is a problem with signing ordinances [Music] here glenn dunn yes thank you i agree with frank banker to begin with i think this whole thing the pendulum has flown too far in the opposite direction and this whole sign thing is this ordinance change has taken a life of its own i think it's absurdly a long and it's corporate sprinting in what we're trying to accomplish here as i'm rolling up at the word session here i think the biggest issue we want to run into is electronic signs and how they relate to commercial businesses and i think we've missed so mark on this and this ordinance is being complete and it's it's not ready to go yeah it's taken up a year to get where we are but i think you're going to try to push this through and then keep the most portion the same down the road and that's going to be another year or two before those questions are answered and surprisingly the biggest sign issue that's garnered the residential pushback is the electronic sign and yet that's not included in this line earnings to address some of the concerns of debbie and roger ball ever since we started talking about this electronic sign we've been trying to state that we look at the best practices for the implementation of electronic science and whatever municipalities are done but it seems to keep latching on to this commercial version and as mayor alonzo puts in the uh the car wash or movie theater or whatever and that's not the case several times we're talking about the standards we want to use to implement this sign and never once has anybody come in to kind of review those things to relay their fears i think it's incumbent upon this city to set the bar for how you implement electronic signs and we need to take the hybrid on this and set the example for commercial businesses and absolutely avoid the flashing signs and strobe into uh epileptic things physic as a helicopter pilot i can speak to that all day long but we need to be the exemplary person in the road on the high road of this thing and we are out there we are not ready so i i'm turn to opposites right now thank you very much thank you mr gun council members anything else i will uh i'd like to address mr dunn's comments originally uh or the last time we uh last conversation we had about this was that this was geared primarily towards changes for residences and uh we would have to come back and append this at a later date and i thought that the council committed to continue working on this immediately so whether we pass this now or we hold off until we we finished the commercial version i don't have a problem with what we have in front of us i agree though that it is incomplete and i believe the recollection is correct because i recall the same thing [Music] and here's my problem okay right now we have really no residential sign or we have an ordinance but we're not going to we're not enforcing it which is a free-for-all and luckily the citizens have been most understanding respectful and good i mean even without an ordinance i don't see any eyesores around the city so people are self-regulating and doing a good job okay and i applaud the citizens for that i remember before i ever saw office sitting in that audience and listening to our then now fred riley our then city attorney talk about passing an incomplete ordinance and i almost fell off my chair going you can't do that and they did it anyway i don't think they ever fixed it um and i'm hearing stuff tonight and i'm seeing stuff that you know even though you've read through this a million times you see it and stuff keeps getting pointed out it is it's very big it's a very big ordinance um it's not ready right now but it it here's our problem we can table it or we can vote it down we got to keep working on it and we are going to run out of time because um and then i have all the political candidates hopefully will regulate themselves or look at people putting up banners that are the size of the roof i'm not sure what we'll end up with um so before i mean we've debated this i'm gonna if there's no other comments actually the uh dave you have the last word is that the last word does anybody else want to speak after dave i have no other comments okay frankie do you want to say something or that would that will give you another opportunity here's what we're going to do frank wants to say something rest the counsel and dave ultimately will get to you last if you want to say anything more now just like mr khan says i don't think it's ready to pass the master yet these citizens have brought up some great comments uh i remember there was a bill passed years ago the speaker of the house back then said you gotta pass the bill to see what how good it is right and i'm still waiting to see how good it is i i just think it should be are you making motion to the table i'm making a motion we have a second on motion to table no second that motion fails any other council comments i i would date here from what i was understanding the same thing he said that we were kind of passing this from a residential and then the commercial aspect would come later but i do agree there's a slippery slope because we very easily wanted to take advantage with this digital sign outside and use it as times square if we decided to nothing in this would stop us so that's going to be a checks and balance on us but i think that what we have so far is good but we definitely do further work from the commercial and the digital sign up front i'm going to agree with you know i wanted to move this thing forward if we could before the reasons that riley gave i think those are all valid reasons it can benefit this community and at the risk and i hope this doesn't happen that somebody goes hot and wild um i don't think this is ready for prime time step there's a couple things that have just been pointed out tonight that weren't totally apparent and you could blame us i mean it is a long ordinance i've read through it a number of times but you just miss stuff and there's a lot so this thing may not pass tonight which will get us back to the drawing board and if it doesn't pass can i eliminate it right back on the work session we're going to keep working on this kill until it kills us we still have a chance we have december and january we come along january so we still cover the season if we can get through this council center we can get through the next work session with it but there's a lot here instead one more thing fred what do you recommend based on all these comments sorry to put you on the spot summed up and what i thought y'all had decided in the last workshop was the digital sign component would would be something we would work on immediately if i don't necessarily agree with the various comments uh but i again say in drafting this there's a lot of things i didn't change at all because that wasn't the tone of the discussion that the city council had so the things that were made you know although seasonal and for example purpose is what john hansek said there's no grand design on anybody's part to violate constitutional rights and with the sign placement it i i know conclusively those were standards that that existed prior to this which is why they weren't changed nobody raised an issue about changing them and the city council in addressing this in as many sessions as it's been addressed did so in a good faith manner to try and work through all the different debate topics that there were if if y'all are not ready to pass it then don't pass it and it will go back to the drawing board but i will will say the the digital sign thing will introduce a whole new element into the discussion and i i my feeling is you you will not be able to pass a sign ordinance that includes the digital element if you're trying to get this done before the uh the election season begins with one caveat unless you have special meetings and you can do it that way if you so choose but that's your your you know i i would suggest if you're not ready if people are not ready to go forward with it then i will read i've highlighted the various things that were discussed tonight i will uh do redline changes to those things and y'all can address it at a workshop in the very near future and hopefully these types of issues can be can be addressed but i i don't like passing something that somebody has uh you know endless questions about but i will tell you it's it's this is a very i've said this all along this stuff is a quagmire because of the the various ways that the courts have handled it and you know you can go through and look for things to cite as a basis for a challenge and you can do that with any law that's even uh more accessible with something like this so that's that's my thoughts on it so if we pass this and the plan is to go back and do the digital aspect would that be an amendment to it you would have another whole section that addressed digital signs it this this is chapter 86 you would have certainly several provisions that are specific to digital signs and we would go through the two you know past first time publication pass second time and then becomes ordinance well i'm on your nipple just for feasibility and to make it more simple trying to pass this one before the political with a vehicle promise and put it on the work session right now to start the digital aspect and get that passed as soon as possible because i have a feeling that what's going to happen is we're going to go back to our section we're going to work out all these it's going to come up for the first readings someone's going to find something else and then we're going to work on those and we're never going to get this done so should we just focus on this and pass this and then put a separate provision for digital signs only work on that and get that done you know the digital sign is the 100 500 pound gorilla now you know that that thing has caused the problem this thing would be ready to go and here's my problem i hear exactly what them all say and i and i respect everything they say and the people that aren't even here that live across the pond on another block that are gonna have to look at las vegas you know south here i would vote for this but i want to hear the city manager who's going to control this sign speak into that mic and tell me that this thing's not going to blink this thing's i mean you got to regulate the temperature of it again it is the first night you might not have it perfect and everything but when that thing goes on if that's like i'm going to go there by their house and lighten up their you know front room then it's no good we're going to turn it off i mean if i have to call special counsel maybe we'll do that i mean i want an assurance i want these folks to walk out that you know we're not going to be flashing it we're not going to be blinking it's not going to be open all night it's not the diner you know what what can we do to assure them because i'll vote for it it goes against everything i believe in to vote for incomplete legislation but we've got to get this residential aspect done before somebody puts up another banner on their house so city manager are you ready to commit to that or can you commit to that um you know that this that we can allay their fears at least until we get around to this because i agree with riley this isn't going to be a one session um topic to go through digital it's a lot well mayor we're going to control the timing of it and that's that's why it hasn't come on yet we're getting some uh sensors uh when you say flashing it's not going to do this it is going to have ropes you know scrolling which you would change anyway that's normal uh and we're not anticipating it's going to stay on online and uh you're not anticipating your no we're not you're not okay and when well we were we were figuring somewhere around 10 or 11 o'clock because that's our what our knowledge is you know but in any case we'll resolve that issue the other thing uh the light throw that everybody keeps talking about we did a light meter study and did all that and the street light over there puts more light on the mall's home that this sign is going to put on their own or anybody across the pond and we'll continue to do those studies once the light is fully operational at this point in time we've got a couple things we've got to add to it to be able to control it it's not going to have advertising on it well i guess you could say it is going to have advertising because it's been advertised if there's a city council meeting or there's a christmas tree lighting or something like that but it's not it's not meant to be commercial it's mainly to put out give the residents city information and that's what it's for and that was always the intent of gentry uh for uh yeah i was going to say i mean mayor you're reacting in the same thing and i'm sure you haven't been through the list of the best practices for the implementation of the slide who we've addressed as a meeting before and kyle and the city manager have it and that's what's [Music] all the council members get get a hold of a copy of that and take a look at it because i think it'll answer a lot of the questions and allay a lot of the fears that we seem to have on this thing because a lot of these things have been addressed by other municipalities and bad actors out there who did it wrong and like i say i think it's incumbent upon us to take the high road in this and do it right if we want to do this sign ordinance as let's touch it one time and do it right the first time and not keep parsing this thing out and uh thanks that's all i get okay thank you i'm gonna try and bring this to a conclusion we're coming up at 8 30 here um any other council comments i don't think they've last ordered no one else anyone else faith i have no other comments okay i'm going to pull the question so up for consideration first reading of ordinance 21-02 an ordinance of the city council of the city of ballard beach florida providing for the

going to be all digital too i mean it's this i don't even remember anymore whether digital's coverage right had homeowners stay digital in their house and i don't know you know so let's find out and

180 days for various things such as uh fail to keep a vote in the arena and updating your comments from the last work session so i think this is uh ready to move forward unless there's some other comments i'm gonna direct one to fred riley i know fred loves this kind of stuff because see fred here's the problem i was watching the world series last night i fell asleep i woke up at 3 o'clock and you know what i was thinking about does the state preempt any of this stuff with boats honest to god right so i'm looking and there's a state ordinance because apparently it's all over the place with how much a state how much a city a local or a local city can do not just in florida but even around the country okay so here we go with another can of worms to open up there is a state ordinance that speaks to this um and i can tell you what it is i actually have it on my phone if you want me to pull it up but i guess the question is is i know you've done the research on this thing we don't have to open this up like a constitutional discussion but are you comfortable uh that is bulletproof but are you comfortable that you're okay in taking the step that we're going to take i'm sure the answer is yes but i just want to pose that question to you particularly since i saw this state statute well it's not clear in the state statute at three o'clock in the morning you should have been considering how could it land up a little forward that should have really been your question but um this this is basil in section 316.20651 and it has the definition and uncomfortable with it because i i'm typically going to be comfortable when the state law gives you a basis to regulate something and that that is what you're doing is you have the authority from this the legislature to implement this if you feel it is an appropriate measure for your community and i think the key was that it has to be really liveaboards that's what they were really looking for you know if somebody was just fishing let's say for a few days that's not what they're looking for these are boats that are considered where you're really you know they have some they're they're out there people are living on them and it's a you know as they call it as a cheap way to enjoy the nice cities and it's a lot of fun i don't have a waterfront property so i have no dog in the fight but you know when somebody parks their coat outside your uh you know two million dollar house it's not funny anymore so that's what this is all about yeah it's within the city's jurisdiction and that you have a basis to regulate things within your jurisdiction i think this is sound any university who's going to determine whether these birds are wrecked or jumped i mean if it's wrecked it's going to have a damage or whatever like that lynn and i were talking about that briefly related to something else but the the code officer of the city has to have a code provision to enforce and then they have to be enforcing the code provision in a good faith manner so the if there is something the rule of thumb that i would expect the code officer is going to apply is if there is something that presents a life safety issue then there's it basically becomes exigent circumstances and some action needs to be taken if it's something that is uh you know junk or dilapidated or whatever infirmity it has that could be a life safety issue but uh often would probably be more of an aesthetic issue yeah and on page six like this repair and we're talking about dots more structures dangerous structures creating a reasonable risk of a bodily injury who's going to get on these debts their private property they uh say hey this needs to be um in writing that i looked at several different uh municipalities and this language came from clearwater who addressed it and they have the same issue you all have which is they have a lot of waterfront properties the the change i made that came up in the workshop was it it initially said any dog warf pile or etc or etc we took out etc and put in more structure so there was a specific thing um partial to it etc although that's what the clearwater ordinance says how would you enforce this um you the code officer is typically not going on to somebody's property but if it's in the structure that's on the water then you know it's a dilapidated dangerous structure and you can write in a boat buy it and see that's what it is then i think the code officer has a basis for bringing a case uh based on what they can clearly see yeah well my my question is if it's falling into the water then it's beyond just apparently but if it looks like it hasn't been painted hasn't been stained but structure's still sound or we don't know the structures don't sound i mean is that something that's disrepaired or is that something that needs to be repaired it might be not eye soothing but it's still private well it is but the language of it says falls into a state to disappear and become and becomes a dangerous structure creating an unreasonable risk of bodily injury to any person who may walk upon their own if you can see there's boards missing and there's that's all different boards missing and boards ready to break are two different things but you can't tell the board's ready to break until you probably step on it well that's why i will go back to the code officer should be in good faith making a assessment of what is what's problematic if it's a significant risk unreasonable risk of bodily injury then they have the basis to bring the case if there's a you know minor thing that's wrong then they really shouldn't be bringing the case but that's you know they in enforcement you have to have some degree of discretion and then when it goes to a hearing you have to present the basis for why there's a violation and the magistrate is the one that ultimately decides whether they presented sufficient evidence or not to justify there being a violation okay and lastly on page seven we want occupancy uh when he slips for within 180 days i'm correct yes so is this spoken to the word by talent because i guess about 50 percent of us live here full time 50 percent done so if you don't use your house in 180 days here this is something that came to response well this at the workshop the city council actually spent i would say a half an hour talking about what the appropriate times would be and this this is what they came up the council came up with i just as a point i drove by there the other day just to see how many and there was only one slip that was vacant um you know so everybody pretty much has a boat there um this was for the person who's basically parking and saying you know and frank i know you tried to come in on this last one and it's a shame because we did talk about all this stuff but not your fault because for whatever reason that phone connection that was horrendous uh you know it didn't work but glendon's as clear as a bell tonight so i don't know is clayton like on a zoom call or is he just on a regular facetime oh facetime on a phone yeah maybe i should try that after we were trying to do is not somebody like you know particularly now i just heard of i was talking to somebody i'm gonna keep that person anonymous that they were saying take months to get a park for a car because there's none in the country same thing with these boats i think dave was saying there was like shortage of parts on some of them so we don't want to penalize the guy who really has a repair that's taken too long what we want is what the whole intent behind this was the guy who buys the boat slip and doesn't even own a boat says i'm going to get one and meanwhile we've got 40 people who really would love to have it so that was the whole intent of listening to try and you know i think there's a thing where they can if they're going on a 200-day cruise they talk to the city manager and he messed the reasonable lights we expect that we have this discussion i mean if you're fortunate enough to go on a 200-day cruise we're not going to penalize you for that but you know if you're just for playing games that's what this intent was to get those people off that slip i just i just think it's governments far-reaching into things that should be reaching again uh customer just to clarify something as an example with the dock you heard a complaint about a doc tonight that resident allowed us to go on to his property to look at this dock it's in disrepair and we have a code hearing on it already scheduled for this month because we've kept talking to the i guess the fiduciary for the owner and we weren't getting anywhere with them so we're going to take it to the magistrate because the doc is in bad shape he explained that the dot was falling in the water too no it wasn't it's not falling in the water and it appears to be uh the cross members underneath it appear to be pretty much eaten up and i personally talked to the fiduciary for the homeowner and told her i said if if you're not going to rebuild the dock then just remove the dock and you know she gave me the run around about it so we're just going to take it to the magistrate it's that's and we went uh i went out with the vice mayor what six months ago maybe and we went out on the water and we picked out people with sea walls or docks that were damaged and just that together and we we stopped by and gave them notices and uh last month i think it was danny had 16 to 17 notices for the dots he was solid taken care of so it's just met our education i just have i've been contacted by people with docs um i've gone out to their house looked at them and they said you know they've had courtesy calls by the code enforcement net but the dots aren't used by anybody but then so i would not let it doubt we'll do their personal business it's it's okay until until it does fall in the water and then it's everyone's problem and that's what we're trying to prevent yeah but what what point does it fall into the water well let me put it this way there was just a normal storm wasn't a tropical storm and i had to be home this was several years ago and my son i was carrying him he's like mommy what's that i look out and there's literally an entire dock floating behind my house when under the little tiny 22nd bridge floated and they got jammed under somebody else's dock granted obviously a boater's not going to miss that but it probably did damage another dock a boat so stuff like that dave can tell you they wash up by his house you see after a big storm you see pieces of docks that have fallen off of the boards they can ruin our docks they could ruin a boat going by so it is a hazard and i mean i've reported to lynn some docks that i've seen where the boards are actually in the water just waiting for right now if it hasn't been painted or stained that's not a code violation okay because you could say the same thing about somebody's house that hasn't been painted but it's about the ones that are obviously in disrepair not the ones that you have to go up and look at every single nail to see if it's you know the right amount of depth i'm talking about the ones that a nice gust of wind is going to start dislodging forwards and then it becomes a problem so not the nitpicky let's look at everybody's and you know i don't like the color of that one but i'm talking about safety to make it clear if if a code officer goes beyond the front of your house your sidewalk or in this case beyond that water anything they find is going to be inadmissible so and if i ever find out that a code officer goes on a property uninvited we're going to have a special counsel to deal with that that is an illegal search and i will not i will not tolerate it and i would hope that no one else on this council will either um so you're not going to find a loose board okay but you know when i'm hearing that pieces of daca stuck underneath yours that one you should be able to catch and that one i think you know i was telling the young gentleman you know about the supreme court case pornography we know it when we see it okay we know we'll tell you if there's a knock that's falling down but if we start getting to a fine point that oh you know i kind of notice you got a screw that's too high hey knock it off okay that's their private property but when the railings are falling down the dock is half in the water it's all rotted out and it's going to be a hazard in a couple of wind gusts then we have an issue i mean these things should stick okay that's the only thing that we're looking at we're not as an example there's a house right across the bridge on 22nd street there actually they probably saw it could see this close by there their whole lift fell into the water and you could see them and you know we had a complaint about it from someone across the water the other way and i mean you stand on emergency so if we get a complaint we contact the homeowner or the renter or whoever's there in most cases they'll take you back there show it to you it's you know the only other way we would find out if there is no complaint if a house goes up for sale we we do a code and lean search to see if there's any violations and the homeowner gives us permission to go on that property and uh that's an option that they don't have i mean the lead search is usually mandated the inspection is a courtesy we'll do it for you if you want it it's not required right but the sea wallet fell in if we wouldn't have done that and notified the owner that that sea wall was going to fall who knows what would happen but you know we notified the owner that they needed to repair that and they had a contractor lined up to do it but then we had three or four days of rain and the whole thing but so we were you know i guess the point of this is don't overreach the fact we said that while we were doing this i remember that comment coming up specifically this is this is a good ordinance as long as we're not [Music] any other council comments good with glenn there uh patty he has no questions okay citizens i just want to remind the council i know that you guys are talking about them in that area generally i said the city manager i gotten a complaint from a citizen over in that area where the council mentioned his council lives for a bunch of someone's dog flew up under someone else's brand new dock and they weren't worried about that this was a doctor and he was worried because someone had just got killed because they hit debris in the water so i i i totally support inspecting without violating anybody's rights but um you know when we think about somebody just got killed because of to bring in the water that's actually that's more something more to worry about than whether you know it's hitting hitting the docks so again our citizens are supposed to be our number one safety thing and i think if the city takes takes it from that point of view it's a safety issue opposed to hitting someone else's dog i think we would be more safe consideration ordinance 21-10 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach

please call councilmember otero i'm councilmember aki aye councilmember aye [Music] councilmember gunn aye vice mayor gavis aye mayor manzo aye passes six to zero it will move to a second reading when advertising in between clerk please advertise item 12 authorization of the city manager texas key date purchase order for audio video upgrades in the council chamber contract with encore broadcasting solutions for microphone speakers and a new wiring configuration please have please have a motion somebody and someone give that a second second president it's up for discussion dave i will refer to the city manager the manager yes mayor console uh we've done a lot of research on this we have some new wiring we've already put new wiring under the floor here kyle has kind of led this charge and i'd like him to come up if you've got any questions this is to create the microphones the and to eventually get the audio visual zoom in your situation like speak right into that microphone because we will be able to hear you with the crescent systems uh community services administrator mayor council uh we uh started this uh the first phase of last budget cycle and we uh we started wiring cad six cables at two floor locations um sending some back to the network room and then some over here to the and after uh you know giving the vice mayor's advice and working with encore broadcast solutions we came up with a plan to flip out first and foremost uh all the microphones except for actually this podium mic um because they thought this was the best solution that we had because we're changing out the rest of them likes to stick mics which pick up a lot better for the purposes of you guys sitting in front of the microphone and help people around you but by changing out all the mics rewiring the speaker wire putting in 12 speakers throughout yeah so it's six pairs so 12 speakers which the way this this room is wired is uh the speakers are actually like an artificial like they look like drop down ceiling tiles but they're they're speakers so those are quite old at this point because they were original and um the encore broadcast solutions their takeoff was after that amount of time things just wear out so that's why we're gonna rewire we're gonna put the new speakers in the microphones and that shouldn't take care of all the audio issues that we do have in this room um and then at the same time what we're doing from these new floor jacks is we're running everything through the cat6 cable as opposed to using some of these microphone wires that we do now so hopefully that's going to clean everything up um putting the city clark over that floor jack over there and then this one being moved over there so the and then at the same time they're going to get a hd video signal that's going to be wired through the from the podium that's going to be taken through 6 cable all the way to each monitor location and the uh projector so that in the future will allow us to upgrade our visual aspects we have monitor capabilities of seeing people up in the days here i mean we used to have monitors right in front of us which were kind of nice now we really like have to go down on the floor to see stuff um presently uh we're gonna keep the same monitoring system so it'll be real like say we do a zoom call what the idea is that the computer that's at this podium will be the main computer so when someone comes up to speak you'll see then it'll be fed through all the monitors in the room so that you'll you'll see who's talking at the same time so right now as far as a solution i guess i don't know how easy it is for you to see the screen [Music] it's back there you can see it but it's you know it is something nice if there was something you know up here you know around the circle or something that we all could i mean the best was when it was right in front of us because you had it right here and i can still be looking at this and listening to you and you know we can maintain eyes contact and stuff but um um whenever we got the original quote it was much higher and it included replacing all of the stats in the room and we can't get back and said no let's just use what we've got for now so although we don't have a way to see somebody is saying a zoom meeting or a presentation um my my thoughts initially were to hang a tv right there that we could just kind of glance up at that everyone would share but i think this phase allows everyone to be seen and will also give us the opportunity to uh to do zoom calls much better much more efficiently and i think that was our first priority was was just to make sure everyone could hear let me ask you this if we had video capability here because there is to be monitors in front of each one of the seats here i imagine that wiring is still in here may not be cat 6 but why can't and it shouldn't be hard to work through this why can't we line up i mean there's a big channel over here that nothing but pens and junk falls into well i can't even we're sitting on something as simple as a computer monitor it doesn't have to be something sexy but i have something right in front of us because we're going to have soon and people just start sharing screens i mean you said lady come here tonight make a presentation let's say she made that presentation on soon you know i want her to be able to share the screen with us and also we'll see it it's okay if we're all in the middle here but it may create some vision issues if you have something right in front of you everybody can see that i'm just wondering i'm not saying no to this i think this is a great step forward but it to me i look at this channel in front of us which the audience can't see right now but there's a big channel here and we can even if it's uh even if it's not pretty even if we're just wiring some computer monitors and tying them into that station here it seems to be that we could have video in front of us here and would it be nice i'd like to see the speakers clearly if they're in particular what you're saying when you're doing the zoom caller that we would be using the ipads so every player like that would have an ipad so yeah so as long as you're doing a zoom meeting and that presenter is typing it through sharing the screen that you guys will be able to see um i have one other question for you probably kyle because we're taking the lead on this i know we looks like we've worked through the hillsborough schools contract and so have we i don't know if hillsboro actually bought any of this same equipment but i i hate to spend you know 35 000 and find out why they're like these microphones are not as good we went to hillsborough and talked to them or seen their system in action i i have not [Music] speakers and we had that discussion and they felt that the uh not the speakers microphones excuse me uh they felt that the ones that they're proposing would be much better for us and they've done all the work at bel air and their system is pretty robust what's the um warranty guarantee that type of stuff on this most county contracts are of this i would i mean this is my feeling and i i hope the council will join me on this i'll pass this tonight and vote yes for this but i want the stipulation that we have at least a 12-month warranty on this it's a 35 000 purchase it's a major purchase for us um and and lynn i mean i i would approve it as is with that stipulation and if it's not then please come back to us and don't go forward with it that's that's me that's what i'm saying i need at least four other people to join me are three other people to join me on that yeah that's standard in the industry let me see if there's any questions from the audience anyone okay um anything back on council they have any last words probably got it okay so this is item 12 authorization for the city manager to execute a purchase order for audio video visual upgrades in the council chamber um do a contract with on-court broadcasting solutions for microphone speakers of new wiring the stipulation of this council has given you mysteries if this passes said it has at least a 12-month warranty you'll check that if it doesn't you will not proceed with this if it passes okay with that you're not a yes okay um with that i can take a voice vote on this all in favor aye is anyone a host we now have six people left so six to zero pass is lit you go forward with it please if there's a problem let us know kyle thank you item 13 is consideration of resolution 2021-11 a resolution of the city council in the city of

to establish a qualifying date for persons seeking elected office for the 2022 municipal election and establishing an effective date a yes vote passes this let's do it we have to do it [Music] council member banker aye councilmember gunn hi otero by senator gaddis all right maria ranza i pass a six to zero these days item 14 consider consideration of resolution 2021-12 the resolution of the city council the city of belarus beach florida providing for november 12th april 2021 to be a paid vacation day for the employees of the city of delaware beach florida and establishing an incredible day this is for employee paid vacation day for copenhagen served uh service motion police so they got a second occupation i will refer to the city management city manager yes we did discuss this at the work session and what i mentioned is excuse me that the city employees for the whole covenant had all of them are vaccinated and numerous cities and counties are given stipends actually and days off for vacation and i will say that our city staff we didn't close one day during coven ever we've had city services every single day and uh the staff came to work every day and uh so the residents did not uh [Music] have any harm or some places closed their doors and things of that nature it's so unrecommended as an incentive to the employees just to give them this day off you know um i remember talking to you like when this thing just started and i remember saying one thing let's try and stay ahead of it because we have no idea what's coming and you just said something which sets us apart from a lot of cities and we're a little city okay remember glenn gunpo there's condos that are bigger than us okay then our whole city okay and it's true there's condos that have 10 000 people in it but you didn't close one day okay that is a testament to our employees and i'm not about giving away free days and giving away rewards for showing up to work but this was something extraordinary i remember talking to you at one point saying that we had no idea like we had no idea this was going to be like a plague and we'd have to close down sections of this they had no idea how bad this was going to be nobody knew okay and everybody came in there was no vaccines at the time and everybody came in in a risky situation it would have been easy for them to call in sick and just say hey forget it i'm not coming in um i support this 100 yeah it says a lot about our employees they stood up for it and this was believe me this was one we were playing with death here this wasn't you know this wasn't a flu this was hard so any other comments and comments yeah i i have a problem with the coke i mean lot of private um are given a an extra day off i don't have a problem by giving the employees an extra day off i think they deserve it i mean especially these guys came in july during that tropical storm that was coming up and gave up their whole weekend they were out there sandbagging i i i would support wholeheartedly any holiday falls on the thursday they automatically get friday in the future i think there's i think the whole stance underpaid honestly but the promise i have is with cogan 19 right like yeah it wasn't a big scare and everything like that but now i don't know are we going to give them off when they have to get their third shot their fourth shot their fifth shot their 88 shot i don't know what a vaccine is anymore i never got a polio booster shot that's what i'm saying so i'm all for giving the employees a day off for more days but i just don't like the wording of the code and i i admire our employees we have the committee working on this but i do remember being briefed on this when we went to the seminar in the summer up in uh orlando and i think if i'm not mistaken correctly if i'm wrong can't we use for payment of this some of uh the money that we got from washington for this relief i think that isn't that to be used for incentives and stuff like that so i just want to be able to use you you can do that but our staff's so small i i wouldn't the the accounting nightmare that that could create yeah you got a cpa firm they do have 10 yes you know for the amount of money we're talking about it's it's negligible and uh because i've talked to other cities that are actually doing this oh yeah i got to do this i got to do that i got to have and we're uh six people small staff and uh we're not intending to uh try to create a bigger issue with the american rescue money we'd like to focus it on infrastructure and that's what we're going to discuss with the advisory committee and i think it's negligible really i just wanted to be considered as an option to utilize that money i mean you know there's 800 grand there so you know if we're looking at spending we don't have to spend any last penny on the infrastructure that's obviously we're probably going to go but um you know it's not a hard thing to come up with what the daily pay is for everybody well it's not so much that but it's as i understand it and and i've talked to a couple cities the reporting of spending that money for what i'll call other things that infrastructure or things of that nature that the reporting is is going to be uh pretty extensive to what i understand and we're not intending to hire a consultant to do it at this point so and but a lot of cities are they're they're going out and hiring consultants to to monitor because of the uh reporting requirements any other council comments [Music] consideration of resolution 2021-12 resolution of the city

zero your staff and your and yourself and patty with our compliments great job thank you very much thank you very much 15 authorization to execute an interlocal agreement between pinellas county and npv sms4 copernitis for florida department of environmental protection annual regulatory program and surveillance the senior local agreement that covers the years 2022 through 2026 motion police [Music] second so thank you gaddis leslie [Music] there are several co-permittees with the mpds program in pinellas county we happen to be one of them and this is a fee that they want you know our contribution to this surveillance fee is 64.97 [Music] in 2021 so uh what i'm asking is uh for authorization for the mayor and city manager to ask you this agreement representative finance committee i'm just playing with okay any other questions on the council citizens how much did we spend for the paper well let me see is fred reilly and the videographer who are making the money right i spent more in review and yeah what we're going to have to pay exactly there's no citizen comments back to council as there any last words here okay authorization to execute item 15 authorization to execute an inter-local agreement between pinellas county and npdes ms4 co-permitties for the florida department of environmental protection annual regulatory program and surveillance fee believe we can do this with a voice vote right madam clerk as we can everybody in favor i am peter post six to zero passes item 16 authorization to award a professional services contract for sea wall and boat ramp design this is for design and engineering services for seawall and boat renovation this is for 7th street uh motion please motion with frank banker second second thank you frank long time it's more than seventh street just kind of fun seventh street uh seawall boat ramp sixteenth street sea wall and a short seawall out here along the circle where i'm sure all of you have been here to the water and you've seen the scouring and we're going to prevent that war shot so this is going to be the engineering conference engineering and lynn i'm going to share this because i had a citizen ask me this so you and i have already spoken on this but i want to share there's not june is the only person left in the audience but they'll see it on the video give the citizens a rough timetable of the rebuilding of the 7th street dock and this whole engineering project and what we're looking at over here well i would i would anticipate the engineering will take us 30 to 60 days to come back from uh rue and then we'll put it out i'll come to the council and ask for authority to get it and we'll we'll bid this probably all as one project we've got funding for the sea wall we've got funding for the program so uh after we did that sometime after the first of the year and we had money for the doc also so yeah i wanna i wanna lay the citizen spheres because there was some real fear there's people who launched boats there regularly and they said it's like no the dock gone temporarily oh that's a separate project right but what you told what you told me was that we could expect the dock probably around spring of 2022. that's a rough estimate so so the dock is coming back it's coming back bigger and better than ever hopefully or at least nice and um nice and sturdy and everything else there's some when we do this there's some comments you know from the citizens of regarding tide poles and dock construction and stuff like that so i just want to make sure that we make sure i mean i know we're going to do it in front of the citizens i just want to make sure that we highlight that because we have some very experienced boaters in this area that use this and they can add certainly some input as to how it should be designed and stuff so they were explaining tide poles and they were like this the old one was wrong and i'm like we gotta talk with the engineers there right right okay all right but that's a setup just to that's separate we're just this is just for the sea wall and the ramp seawall ramp and the sea wall at 16th this is going to change the look out there correct yeah okay it's going to improve that appearance and uh you know it'll have a raised cap and we'll kind of do some more landscaping behind it but that's a really a separate project are people still going to be able to swim we're just trying to protect because eventually with the scouring that keeps happening it's just going to keep coming closer and closer there's rock out there we have a bad storm that that rock isn't preventing anything the rock will still end up against it because it's a good protection for the sea wall but this this will at least stop that scarring basically from the bridge apron that's down below to the walk over that's that's where the biggest scary is that was my only concern that people still be able to enjoy because i do see a lot of people fish over there to award a professional services contract for seawall and boat ramp design and the explanation is design and engineering services for seawall and boat ramp renovation yes let me move this forward uh we can do a voice vote all in favor aye aye anyone host six to zero move forward please that concludes our regular agenda we now go into any unfinished business is there any i'm hearing none i moved to the city attorney this is number in rome okay so city attorney is actually 18 city manager is 19 city clerk is 20 city council is 21. item 17 is unfinished business that's completed i'm an 18 city attorney no report due to the late hour we've done a lot later it's been a long one uh city manager when you haven't had energy well excuse me i've got a few things uh we're going to bring the boy ordinance to have another discussion in the world session with the work session the buoy yes we've done some more research with the communities up and down the beach and uh i'll have probably some more sessions which uh at your seat i gave you the annual report that we prepare every year in november kind of highlights what the staff has done over the year and as i mentioned earlier you know i just wanted to reiterate the staff they've continued to provide services and control costs and where we could increase any revenues they they worked hard at doing that and i think our uh this new year 2021 budget year a lot of things have improved not only with infrastructure taxes rentals parking fees a lot of those things have increased dramatically so the staff's done a great job with that and we got through the crs verification visit and that was a positive we'll we'll talk to the sheriff about the supplemental stuff yes and we'll figure out something with that uh i think i said it but we're all in agreement with that right council youth legitimate service the supplemental sheriff's services let's say i don't know we weren't on council we started that but we have some options we've set aside some money to introduce the sheriff on special occasions for specialized direct control speeding things like that we don't announce it uh city manager works it out and surprise surprise on the bridge and it's a bad weekend so um the fastest cars i see are the ones that are out at five in the morning that's whenever if you're a runner you're walking your dog you're trying to cross the intersection someone's going to get moved down yeah it seems like to i mean you know again i'm not going to give any hints but you know when we get to the weekends and stuff we can hear it you know particularly now that the windows are open you can just hear them they hit beller beach you know indian rocks is all lit up and then it looks like we're asleep here because we're residential they let it loose and you know and they're flying but i will say that it looks like you know that sign across the street fellow shores by the way um because they haven't been told what was coming against um they uh but they said you know because it's it's it's making people slow down and i think it is making people slow down so that's a good thing but um they fly still you know up the other way and uh it's a little scary because and occasionally you will hear the sheriff racing after him so yeah i think those those radar signs do help to some degree you're not going to stop everybody i mean i'll give you an example going down gulf boulevard last week one day with the code code guy and i went out and spent the afternoon together in a city truck because i can't go in his car car goes out because we're not going to whatever speed he was wanting car goes out of the lane and passes us but you know we didn't have this car so there was no way to go but you know it's it happens i mean you're going to prevent it all i just wanted to bring up last month you made a comment about the storm water pond over there and i did contact the county just to see what they do because i know what they told me two or three years ago and they pretty much told me the same thing they're they have no intent of digging it out they do a inspection poorly and i got to provide you the last two inspections and really what they're looking for is silt in the structure that's across the street and they do remove that when they come for the inspection but one thing additionally i asked him about is the fence i said either fix it or get rid of it because it's really not serving any purpose and it's rusty now there would have to be something put along the structure which is uh almost directly across kind of in an angle across the street it's the concrete barrier the rear that the water flows into but they are looking into that so that's just to give you an update they're they're not interested in digging it out and i don't know if you can talk to somebody specifically but these were the stolen water people so i just wanted to let you know that thanks for checking in on that and uh that's all i have mike and i'll get together on the border adjustment training we did that last spring so that's not a big deal and i had one thing i want you to just um i don't know whether it's even it may not even be our issue but at the 12th street eastman the house next to it which has had eternal construction okay apparently i heard a report i it was told to me so i didn't see it i didn't get pictures but apparently they were blocking our eastman pouring concrete at the house and then we went by the other day and there was cones in the street now i don't know whether those are undergrounding cones or they're the remnants of the sidewall cones but there happened to be a bicyclist in the bicyclist plane that's where they put the cones in so now this bicyclist had to come over into the traffic lane which is now as we're hearing maybe a little narrower than it needs to be it's a mess and i'm like if they're doing this unilaterally that is a real problem it goes back to the sheriff enforcement nobody should be blocking anything on gulf boulevard in our town or about our shore that's a sheriff's thing but if they have permission or it's part of the underground i don't know so i said let me bring it up to you and just see what you will part of the work was underground the last couple days the last week and then uh one day they were pouring the apron to the driveway to the new home uh which you know they've got to have some kind of safety traffic control and they put the cones out there i don't there was no restriction to going to 12th street i mean you could turn in there but there was a cone before it don't happen i heard officers vehicles or whatever or whatever they were using was blocking it of course the person did not have their cell phone with them and i did not get a picture of it um i don't know and that that could have happened okay but i'm saying it wasn't preventing you know maybe there was a concrete temporary you know dumping his load of concrete well i don't know where he's going to dump it unless he's in that i saw it and [Music] it was a mess between the traffic uh the way the traffic flows you know that sign that being in the way and then they have construction and uh the lane that everyone is supposed to now go into to go straight was blocked just it was sleep confusion right well that was when they were doing the drive i don't think it's been a problem with the underground people they're off the street and they're you know a spectre of who it is shooting the undergrounding project on that side of the street give her to them crosswires that was the one thing i had anybody else with any citizen questions from a city manager i i i wanted to go back on that double turn lane that's something we really need to look into i purposely tried to stay in that lane coming here tonight and you just can't do it there's not enough room to make that left turn i don't know what the fix is but someone's we're going to have some bad pile-ups out there yeah i've talked to the county about a couple things already it may be that they need to shape the turn a little better it may be that their initial recommendation was to take that island out that's backed up so you can kind of slide over and get in that other lane the other question that's been brought up is it used to be when it was red left turn and there was no cars coming from the other way it was leaking caution where you could make a left turn those are questions that i posed to the county i haven't got answered yet i hope they work out whatever know problems we have because the the busy season is coming really soon and uh you know there's definitely some questions they have part of it i think too is it's it's new to people that's that's a little bit of a struggle i'm sure another issue with that is once you've turned onto cosmic boulevard is there enough room for the guys in the right lane to merge and if there's a whole bunch of people coming in the right lane to merge into the left leg heading east is there enough distance there maybe two did that make sense it's going to require a lot of cooperation in an overly aggressive pinellas county for this to work out and i would say also my concern because i've tried out that lane to the new left lane and the concern is when you're taking a left the people come the opposite way taking a right or kind of used to going so that may have to be a no right on red well they haven't met they have a red light right but we all know those are yields so a no-brainer may have to be added there if we keep it and glenn wants to speak so we get to him but if we do that you know last year was the first year of south of the bridge franklin southern bridge right south of the bridge we were getting constant traffic on the weekends on our side which we used to never get that as they were going up to the light every weekend there was traffic so if we make that no turn on red um we did push it back to indian rocks i mean the county really yeah it was him so we don't know right on reddit but i hear you because now everybody's merging into the same piece well i think it's partially like i said there's some newness here uh and even the county said you know we've got to give it some time and see how it works out and they're monitoring it and with their cameras and uh there seems to be two green lights in the straight lane and that's another question i've asked unless there's some reason for it i'm glad they studied this experience glenn garnett's question yeah i was just going to add money and interval back on that thing is and i used it exclusively for the last three weeks after we went in and i had absolutely no problems it seemed like the people making the right turn lane coming north on the little and i've had no problems emerging their traffic in the first lane seemed to be very cooperative and not always immersed before i even got to the first street coming off of the southbound on the cars were i mean i've had no problems now the substantive feedback is just like a city manager said there's an extra green light there people are confused by it and the other thing i would add is we probably need to validate the turn radius on that dashed line for the center line it seems like it's very right angle instead of a curve there but i'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the turn rings for the large trunks that are turning off of gold or to access the causeway uh i i think the uh the county looked at with their engineering staff and bought into it so they obviously have some scanners for emerging there so i'm not quite sure that's an issue right along with the city manager i would say given some time because just like the sign says there's a new traffic pattern there and people aren't fully aware of it i think the real acid test is going to come with the snowbird season and the spring breaks i think we really need to sit back and let let us evaluate a little bit more and see what happens but it seems like the traffic seems to be moving turned officially through there and that's that needs to be the first step to be determined for when you start taking out the island uh further to the north of the intersection and moving trees and that sort of thing with respect to the the speed signs my question is is we've got new speed signs to the south and we've got the one that comes off of the bridge the question is have we collected any speed data from those signs yet because we just had a citizen's complaint about excessive speed on the uh coming down the bridge there and we probably need to pull it out and take a look and see what we're actually seeing there as well as we always have the anecdotal complaints [Music] i just have to request it from them and they did give it to us for the southbound comfort times and we found that it actually slowed the traffic uh and and i'm i'm thinking you know when i've been out on gulf boulevard and see people in front of you for the most part they're hitting their breaks and slowing down so uh we'll get some data from that the bridge i have two more points when you're yeah done finished good hey glenn yeah we talked about the special uh enforcement we paid for to have uh the officers sitting at the bottom of the approach there with their radar and we didn't see anything significant there and maybe it's time to put a speed box further up on the bridge and take a look at that stuff so that's that's one thing the second thing i would we talked about some of the the lawn services and the big delivery trucks parking in the center turn right there and i would just advise a cautionary make sure we truly understand the problem before we take action on it because a a consequence of that might be is if you insist on these large trailers and trucks pulling into private drives service bel air shore imagine what it's going to be like when those trucks or trailers have to back out during spring break or during snowbird season entire traffic as they're trying to maneuver and stay in the parking rates so i think that's all i did thank you thank you glenn city manager okay all right um city clerk thank you all very much yeah thank you thank you great job enjoy the day off thanks and city council we start with leslie noterow um reviewing bellar shores minutes uh audio this past month they received our letter it wasn't received too well by one commissioner but the mayor seemed to uh thought it was a pretty generous offer words that he didn't say but they're looking into it a little bit more aggressively they haven't shut it down but your attorney i don't believe has all the facts with the fwc that i wrote to patty because i want one i got a citizen asked me about um the buoy changes in delaware beach which she says you know it was stated in the council that i'm against any votes coming into short i've never said i was against any votes coming in for sure i was never against any buoy changes in bel air beach i still have i'm not enhancing to be changed in dollar beach and i'll get into it the next word session but i think what we need to and i would like to reach out to mayor schmidt and see if i could have a discussion with a mom if you have an email address to them or not and do some clarification on all this i i listened to those meetings recently as part of my um due diligence for the suit and i heard everything they said about the movies and i know because of the sunshine i think i can't talk with you so now i can talk with you about it um it was fairly well received the person who doesn't receive it well doesn't receive anything for us so i'm not i kind of discount that the one comment that i do remember hearing from their attorney they said maybe bel air beach doesn't realize how generous small for this was because they were coming up with some estimates of like a hundred thousand plus to do this and my first inkling was a hundred thousand dollars to save a few buoys i mean if the state has made it this complicated well they're almost making a disincentive for safety and that is just against everything we stand for as a city it should be everything against base that they stand for i don't know if like you said she doesn't have the right information or do we shoot ourselves in the foot because when i heard a hundred thousand dollars i almost fell off my chair going well did we just offer them 100 now because that's a chunk of change um but i'm not saying no to it but i just want to make sure we know what we're getting into because they seem to think like wow thanks a lot this is really a great offer we're only talking about two buoys right and i think and she was she was talking about replacing them all yeah okay and and to put in two buoys is probably gonna cost us after we buy the buoys and what have you uh somewhere around three thousand dollars well that's a big difference you know now there is going to be some cost for them to rewrite their ordinance because it'll have to be clear and i will i truly believe that other shores putting put in a request right now for two permits with no weight zone and idle speed at permanently pass right now no well i'm telling you right now um not according to fishbowler well according to fish and wildlife if you go back a year ago they asked repeatedly what's going to be on the buoys and in the emails it changes with kyle said idle speed no way three times theirs so the other towns aren't being attacked only us uh we should we should just re-modify that permit back when i first bought it and i think it would have got passed decently but you know frank we've had liberties go across i'd say go across across the street but really it's down the road here he went to their meetings and spoke about underground and stuff like that um you are clearly the the most knowledgeable person that we have in this uh city on this on this buoys issue i have absolutely personally no issue whatsoever with you going across speaking with them speaking at their meeting um because i i sensed that they were open to it and if you read some of the actually some of the stuff that i've picked up in the discovery they were not for a little while ago so i think there's been some breakthrough over here and it is a safety issue and if if you know if it's three thousand dollars and they say yes i mean we're gonna vote on that real quickly because that's a no-brainer so i've talked to some of their residents and asked council to bring them back some of their commissioners actually addressed it and brought on them put on the record before that they would like to see them back and they actually used a scenario to use the pinellas pennies from canals but it was already spent but all that said is i think it can be done easily if they get the correct information and not i'm not degrading their attorney or anything like that i just think there should be a meeting i mean you know attorney to attorney we've had some battles and stuff like that with litigation but she did very i thought a very thorough explanation to that council so she put some time in on it again she may have some misinformation um i have no problem with you reaching out to the mayor it's up to the other council members but he certainly had my standard of approval on any other council members how do you feel reach out to women if they want you to speak at the meeting i mean you know you're not representing the council but you're getting the information to them you help clarify it and um if you can move it forward and you know yeah [Music] you know before you do that frank at the work session we need to clarify what our wording is going to be and because we sent what we thought we had back up to the fwc and they gave us another rendition which fred and i so if they're immediately to it we just need to be able to make sure this will be what their wording is going to be we don't know what their city's doing i mean we know what we wanted you know when we were well they have to be the same you know or something similar uh unfortunately i can tell you one of the deciding votes over there talks about how he brings his paddle board out from his house that's not a restriction the issue is unfortunately based on my last conversation with fwc is we don't qualify to have a i no wait zone and unfortunately because of all this back and forth they're looking at us and so we have to come up with whatever zone it is and then change change our moves which well again that's that's my discussion on another night but uh yeah we'll have that discussion at the work session if everybody's okay with putting that back the [Music] we have our work session i think around 15. they're usually their meetings around the 18th or something yeah so they have a better understanding once but he still will want to get on the agenda if he wants to speak at the meetings i would like to know the direction uh what it is that we are deciding upon before you have that conversation so that we're on the same page i don't want them to agree to something and then we have to bend to match them if we're all going to have to do the same thing i don't think we all have to be the same we are two separate cities so well mayor you do because they don't qualify any more than we do to have like i don't know weight zone based on the statutes but they could let me give you some error they could have no like our first thing was no no vessels at all and we could have oh yeah yes so that's what i was talking about yeah i mean they don't qualify they don't qualify no matter what they do they're not going to qualify they're not going to qualify neither do we but they say no nothing which i don't think they will i think they're going to go well they're going to probably want manually propelled you know paddle type things but um so i don't think it matters because they'll get their own choice really you know we could have two separate things we could right but what i'm saying is the i don't know way it's it's out it's it's pretty much dead and talking to clearwater they have no swim zone up to somewhere along north beach but beyond that there's no buoys no nothing you can do whatever you want um that's pretty much private residents in indian shores our indian rocks has no way but nobody's brought that to the fwc's attention indian shores has no buoys they they opted to get rid of them and uh has a swim area swim only uh no no wait zone so we're getting the information from the other cities so unfortunately we got attention but not the attention we want yeah because we don't have a lot we don't have a boat ramp let's see what else was there within 500 feet we don't have a fuel station all of that was was you know brought up to us when we sent back what we thought we were going to do unfortunately but then we have no vessel zone now people still do it so it means you know we've got more shares so you know you take your choice i'm not telling anybody to break the law but you know people are going to chance it out yes yeah you're not you're not going to prevent it the difference is your chance that you hit somebody you got massive liability because now you're violating the the police and then have fun you know the person you hit will own your boat so that'll be the end of that game frank i'm okay we're going right now but we have to vote on this so we let's make sure everybody's on the same page but because they can do this different than us the state's going to ultimately tell them their limits and their limits will be the same as ours they're not going to get votes so so i'm okay with him i would like to know exactly what he's going to say and the reason why is because it looks to me like approaching the fwc backfire i know it wasn't intentional but it does work well i didn't approach the fwc the city approached the swc when i brought this to the attention of the city saying hey we got a safety issue here and i got residents complaining if we would have just gone to the fwc and said we need to amend the permit again because we removed too many buoys this thing would have been we've been done over all right but we looked at trying to say keep the buoys out that's where this is that's when the fwc got their hairs on again i i think frank should get the call into the mayor get on their agenda we can certainly you know make sure we have talking points given to him um on the 15th you know that our voices are heard the way we want to be heard but i i think he's got to start this ball rolling things move slower over there than they do here they don't have the staff like we do getting mayor schmidt he's you know law suicide he was a decent guy i was able to reach out with him many times in the past and um [Music] so is he going to talk to the mayor now and then what are we doing i'd like to get it going on the day or at least and then he comes back in well if it needs to be an agenda item um you know i would say and we're going to have a work session right before that meeting so let's just kind of let's work on the game plan together the message you're going to deliver and uh i think [Music] speak to one council member but it really that's one council member and they can't speak to anyone else so you can you can talk to one but until you address the entire council you're not gaining any traction and and i i know bob also and he's he'll listen to you but under the current circumstances doesn't give a whole lot back he's uh he's very very careful about his word and what he says so i would just let him know that if you want to put an agenda item on there and you like the opportunity to speak and then um let's kind of do a review of what it is that you're going over to talk to because i don't want it to appear that it's frank banker i would like this council to know what it is that you're going to well how about if i just do this i'll just go over and talk to him as a citizen can you need our permission for that just say you're representing yourself and you're just getting some information i mean i think he'll give you the idea of [Music] he'll know what his council's feelings are and i think there's four people on that council that will go along you know the county mayor schmidt probably have four people you might have one problem is that one person is a very influential council member there so um so that's and that the extent that let's put it on our work session um and then frank will come back to us maybe it's a better insight and then we can say here's our city's position he can convey that i'll be able to grow good with that go ahead yeah i plan to put the bully ordinance discussion of the buoy ordinance on the work session we have a lot of this coming work session so i mean we still have some leftovers three other things the report i don't remember with the other we saw a letter that we're writing to bella shore about parking lots yeah that's on there the attorney general's opinion that i brought up the best practices for staff reporting blind brought up discussion the letter to the dollar short and then i added the boolean orders so that's what right now is frank i'm still on you okay um okay uh dave dennis no comment and um i don't have any comment either it's late we've had a nice meeting i enjoyed it i'll get a lot done next meeting is uh november 15th we have a city council work session at 6 00 p.m for these items patty what's the approximate deadline for getting anything on the agenda if anybody comes up [Music] [Music] so probably tuesday yeah yeah next year all right [Music] it's been around many many years my only concern is something to look at beforehand we have those limited access on on morgan because of the sea oats and the dunes and stuff like that so how does we don't want everybody walking on it this supposed to be for you know people with disabilities and stuff so how do we work that into the existence [Music] probably [Music] or anything well no it would have to go where the concrete ends okay it might work and the price is right great um all right i'll entertain a motion to adjourn second all in favor all right have a good night"
