    "transcript": "issue you know if you have a storm coming through I did a beach Patrol the other night and I can barely get the data and again I don't want to speak to the actual numbers um but it would be the collection and the total averages that come through they do their calculations all up my pay grade of course that's up to the surve and people get paid the money for it uh but they're the ones who would determine that mean high water line uh so again just because it's past that point at one point doesn't necessarily mean that's their the total amount okay so it would be an average Mark and we've lost so much Beach over the last 5 years that's another unclear corre I know what I'm saying I I completely understand that and the other point I want to make it's been discussed here on the record that these are supposed to be complaint driven and both the times I don't think it was complaint driven know what I'm saying and again without knowing the specific instances I can't speak to that often times when the deputy out on patol or they made aware of an instance they're not going to let that person know that this is a complaint driven matter they may just have the information about it they see set events right if I was got a complaint that there's a dog on the beach or on the B uh Shor side that there's a bicycle on the beach I mean I let somebody know Hey listen we received a complaint I'm just going to address the matter with them because it would be the same enforcement type of action and and to conclude I think you were the deputy uh I was closing the gate one night you were on the uh Gator probably if it was night time yep thank that man right there for fixing the wheels I was going to say that I've noticed a stark Improvement on at least two of those Gates okay thank you thank you sir any other questions or comments uh miss ellot you have any question no thank you all right thank you Deputy uh Mr reer would you mind giving the U code enforcement report please yes sir uh yes dep Trump was not able to make it today just came back from uh vacation he did not he was unaware of the res scheduling of the meeting but uh just a quick overview um we're still uh most of our code cor cases are dealing with the U unper remodels and other other uh construction work without the permits but recently uh with the warm weather coming in the uh growing season has started pick up and we've been focusing on getting the NES out for the uh the properties weeds and the high grass so so far I think we've done about five notices of violation and uh to this point they both came into compliance but we're interesting on that yes Mr robt um so Kyle on the very last page it talks about the plan overgrowth of structing which is on 107 on 21st Street so I I have seen that house before any living there currently there isn't anyone living there um the owner is unable to to the residents uh we do have obviously fines in place um we're were hoping that would move things along to get the property taken care of right now they're just accumulating is there anything um and maybe Mr Mo that's been following to your your area can the city actually go in and do the cleaning and back build that to the owner as opposed to just letting it stay in the state this in which is horrible not knowing more of the particular property in each instance cities do have the ability to Abate certain kinds of nuisances or overgrowth and things like that but the the entry on private property is not a remedy we exercise quickly um we wish to First seek compliance through the owner whatever property owners that issue okay very good thanks any other questions thank you Mr I appreciate thank you all right now we're up to item number five which is a presentation from the penel Sun Coast fire and rescue district is Chief Davidson here tonight he is not but he was supposed to send someone in his place okay uh and who would that be they I don't see anyone all right well we will move on then now we're up to item six this is a presentation uh concerning female look back period uh it's presented by Sean Hayden who's a student at St uh St Petersburg College um did he made y there he is how you doing Sean uh doing well thank you nice to see you again um hello my name is Sean haon I'm a bachelor student at St College um my program is post Administration um and for my cap Zone I came to work on a um pros and cons for fell beaches by backy and I first want to thank um R Rose um and mayor David gtis for the interviews and the the help doing this project I would have been able to do it without the um communication support offer um I think the first thing that I I first had to discover was why what topic should I choose and why and I found that um the look back period is a widespread issue a lot of each Community SP um especially Beach their 5year look back perience is coming to discuss and and understand that and I think it was a good topic to choose timing wise and hopefully it's it's helpful to the city um I find this this topic to be important um mainly because uh risk 2.0 thema coming out has changed a lot of the landscape behind flood insurance and the way that people deal with um the flood rules in cities and the current codes and enforcement in b beach are a little outdated and so it's a good time to revise and look into that with these new understandings and and we appraise what currently exists and maybe make different choices depending if they are threats I uh when I initially did my paper I did a survey into the uh residents uh over 400 residents I around 40 to 41 responses with around 60% that wanted uh less of a li back period or a lot less compared to the 17.5% who wanted more or a lot more in between would be those who had no indifference and like it as it was um the look back specifically is officially termed a cultive substantial Improvement and is the period of time in which a substantial Improvement can be held so for 5 years currently as long as you've done one project on the hook for 5 years until that resets the main purpose behind this lip back period is bema to deter facing um the whole reason why uh substantial Improvement substantial damage exist because Fe does not want people to pH Properties by having separate projects to avoid the 50% rule um the look back period itself is just a way to maintain those permits prevent people from having too many permits open and put undue burden on the city I think that the language currently as it sits with substantial uh Improvement is only within the definitions under certain subsection so I believe this language there needs to change and have something under the flood Administration docents which already I do believe exists but it doesn't have it under the exact period it just has the language of substantial appr for damage so I believe that that should change um also based off of the way that the current crss accounts are applied there is not as much benefit currently to maintain a 5year look back period for the CRS benefit um so it makes sense to reduce the current look back period and give residents more options to improve their homes more frequently but still to maintain some degree so the city's not overwhelmed by perit um the current cost of reducing the look back period one year seems to really be the increasing work for the city and that potential 20 points of the SOS discount but as the S discount is not applying as much that is um potentially less of concern currently um so my recommendation would be that the city reduce the current back period to a one year and to reevaluate their current code for that Li period thank you thank you Sean Council any questions Mr first of all can we get a copy of your report yes I will be emailing my report to the city manager after this meeting tonight and he can distribute however he wishes um and I'm I'm not sure if you were in the room or not when the resident got up and spoke about substantial damage to property her catastrophe of $14,000 being told to te house down yes so that does not have anything to do with the city unfortunately I'm not the city is not I'm not bringing the city into this at all this is that 50% more and um a lot of people are under the assumption that um well my house is worth a million dollars okay that's not the way fean calculates structure of the house okay so if you're only be worth $200 $300,000 you have $150,000 worth of damage or as you noted windows in last year year before you gr for you may have already exceeded $100,000 PR yes um often times with the human substantial Improvement um people are unaware of the put back period as it is exactly what it is and the terms behind it um when I spoke to the city manager he talked about the process about there's different forms and things that present by the city try and make that awareness more widespread but even from my understanding it's a complicated topic and so I I can understand from residents um Viewpoint how they can can confuse that there are often times um improvements or if you buy a home because it continues for ownership where people end up with um holding the bag so to speak where they they don't have as much improvement to their property so that that can be an issue yes and um fortunately this Council I was hoping was going to be on this agenda we're going to expedite at the last work session because we're redoing all our code but we're coming into a storm season right now so important that we reduce that from 5 years to one year or even less and I've been leg all council is in agreement with that right I really appreciate the looking into this and you understand Fe 2.0 nfip is under suit by about 14 States right now yeah it's it is very confusing and a lot of people are coming to discover different issues interactions with it because they uh I find a lot of cities don't fully understand because uh until they they gotten into the issues they discover a problem when they say okay let's work through this and it it requires a lot of effort to get the full picture I spent about three or four months working on my project and even now I still I don't fully understand the picture I have what best I can to represent Beller Beach and the cities and communties around it and for the topic specifically but even uh speaking with the flood play manager um that it's it's not as easy and clearcut as it is it takes a lot of research understanding to come to a proper understanding of the topic and I've uh gone from Washington all these Underwriters that show me these supposed discounts because 2.0 States clearly take your elevation standard substandard grade you're supposed to get a discount every foot over that and no one can show anybody where there's discounts even even the city discount yes sir um I've also heard from when interview um there is a thema document that references how over a certain amount of risk you get diminishing returns to your CRS discount it's in the wording under feema documents so I i' I've heard a lot of different interpretations I heard from from one source that it applies you just don't see it I've heard somebody say that I've seen Fe documents that I've looked into the the coordinator manual into the the code itself and it's it seems to me and from what I can gather from the research that I've looked into that the CRS discount is for people who are at flood risk at least are not getting the full benefit absolutely absolutely yeah thank you so much anyone else any other questions yes sir have you completed the project uh yes I completed the paper okay have you submitted it I have submitted my paper did you receive a grade not yet part of part of my grade is is submitting to the city council so uh by the end of this week I'll be presenting to my school board and then I will find out whether I pass or not I think they give me a week or two before I get the official grade the best of Lu thank you Sean I'd like to thank you for coming out and speaking tonight I'd also like to thank you for um for Distributing the survey whenever I saw it I wasn't really sure what I was looking at and so I started completing it and then I stopped and I started doing my own homework and that's whenever I realized you know not everybody's like we are we uh Treasure Island doesn't even have a look back um Indian Rocks has a onee look back and uh and then you and I met and and we both kind of had similar questions and eventually I I brought it back to the council and said why are we doing this I asked the city manager why are we doing this and uh no one really knew and um maybe in the past it made sense but now I agree with you 100% I think um a zero look back may not be in our best interest but I I certainly agree with one year and I believe the rest of the council does agree also so uh I would like to uh applaud you for for your efforts and your project I hope you get right Miss Elliot before Sean leaves do you have any questions or comments just a comment I wanted to thank Sean for his report I look forward to reading it and just as a reassurance to the community that um because this issue has been raised we are looking at it very seriously and if you have any views we welcome hearing from you thank you m' thank you time thank you all right we are now up to the quarterly board reports uh I should actually just say report because the only board that's presenting this quarter is uh Park and Recreation okay my name is Patty Roberts and I live at2 20th Street am I too close you're perfect far from that okay um first of all I'd like to say um thank you to Tammy who resigned from The Parson R board and then um the person R board chose me as the new chair so I'm very honored to not replace her CU I can never do that but following her footsteps we also have new co-chair John Wagner our secretary is Michael leaks and members de Debbie DMO and alterate Susan KY um so in the last several months um and October we had a Pets and Pals out here on the patio which was very successful lots of cute kids and even more cuter animals so December we had a holiday social and tree lighting out here in the lobby which was very well attended January we had a health and wellness Fair it was nice we had about 20 to 25 vendors but not enough people maybe only I think it was about 50 45 50 showed up so we will if you want us to continue doing this you will need to give us better attendance um we have blood drive in January and March again not very much attendance but it was successful in their eyes cuz I talked to them in March and we are selling lots of merchandise we have beach towels baseball caps Koozies water bottles um the most um popular items are usually the baseball caps and the beach towels which we have an abundance of right now and we' sold several this week according to Renee um ongoing events are the yoga that's on Monday and Wednesday and salsa classes that started I think about two weeks ago they go for six weeks some of the main things that are happening right now with us are our monthly Beach cleanups we just have them on this Saturday which was so successful I think we had 12 people was it 12 John 12 people and for the past three months we've had four maybe five so we were really excited this past Saturday with our beach clean up please continue to do that it's the first Saturday of every month our Park surveys was our next biggie event um between the five of us we divided up the 18 to 20 Parks or places here in the in our beautiful little town and we go out with a form it has about six categories on it and we look look at walk through touch feel um all throughout the parts and make our recommendations or our positive comments about our parts so we had some really really positive comments this time because we did it a less little less than a year ago and there were several things that needed to be looked at and maybe repaired and I'd say 90% of them have been taken care of and the parts looked beautiful if you haven't been to Morgan Park lately you should go you should go they've done a lot of changes there it's really pretty um added a grill added more trash cans which we always need um rearranged the benches and the picnic tables and the biggie they painted the bathroom okay it looks really nice inside and out special I call it concrete paint on the flooring that makes it look splattered um and new toilets it just looks really nice excuse me um so Aaron or Mr Glenn's and his crew have been doing a fabulous job so if you see them out on the road please tell them thank you and that they're doing a good job what's up oh the last thing would be new ideas that we're considering considering them so we would like to maybe add some plant flowers to the medians there's just two of them or maybe some places around um City Hall maybe annuals or perennial but we would take care of them as parks and wck and um the biggie is a mural on the bathroom wall at Morgan Park we're thinking of something very simple like um maybe a turtle or a palm tree or you know with a beach at the bottom but something pretty simple starting with one side and maybe going all the way around at least three sides so um we're talking to a couple of muralists in the area that have given us um some some of their ideas so my big question to you important people up there would be when we get our sketches for real would you like to see them first and you guys make the choice or as a committee would parts of re make the choice would be I'm sorry where would this mural be it's on the bathroom wall at Morgan Park and we would start with the wall that faces the street I would be open to allowing Park and wck to make a recommendation okay pick pick your favor and present it to the council and if we don't like it then I'm sure that somebody will say something about okay that's a deal we hope we hope we'll have some is next month for your meeting next month okay um the other thing is a suggestion to make our signs around the city like at the park areas more positive wording then so many circles with the big X on them that just are not very friendly and have more instead of um you know no trash no this no that um please help us keep our city beautiful type things so that's just another suggestion from Parks and wck trying to keep us from looking like those guys I got you all right any questions for M yes sir I appreciate you get the blood dries back and uh Tamm I did I did thank you Tammy okay um and I did visit Morgan Park since it's been reopen and uh I brought up to this already a couple times about soap dispensers which they are now in place and that was a yeah they have a couple more things to do there toilet wasn't in either yeah but that was a complaint from a couple Beach cleaners like why can't we get some soap and we're in parking thank you anyone else Miss Elliot uh one thing that we might consider is uh having the pet bags in all the parts rather than the one I believe it's just a Bayside part I'm sorry I'm sorry um the pet weighs of doggy doggy baged at Bayside par perhaps they can be at any of the parks okay thank you any other questions or comments all right thank you m Roberts thank you okay item eight the City attorney report Mr Mor you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor um first I'd like to mention again the legislative session ended March 88th um so a month ago today we've provided you some legal updates on some of the more significant changes that were monitoring I say monitoring because the governor has not yet received um some of the more significant legislation such as the uh building permitting some of the building permitting timeline changes and um some other some other relevant changes that still sit before or await getting before the governor uh for final execution we will of course keep you appr prized of that you should have also received a legal memo providing you some analysis concerning recent Supreme Court jurist Prudence on the use of social media by uh public officials um as far as um I had intended to speak to you tonight um concerning the correspondence from Val Shore I wish to um correct or address some of the statements made um the letter referenced is dated um March 21st it's dated after your election day your election here was March 19th um so the letter was dated March 21st I did not receive it March 21st I that was a Thursday um I received it on um in my office on Monday March 25th um I contacted their Town attorney to discuss the matter uh and in trying to reach our learn Miss Kardash is actually no longer the town attorney in bore she separated or or left her employment with that firm um so I I actually spoke with their the um acting Town attorney through the person cone Law Firm this morning uh precisely about this issue uh the letter as phrase seeks two raises two primary concerns the first is a indemnification demand for the $ 23,753 related to their quote unquote out of pocket attorney's fees litigating belir Beach residents um I not of the opinion that that is a responsibility of the city and I've communicated that um to their to their current legal councel um the second issue raised was one of parking um that is um I would say a secondary impossible and tertiary issu as you look at this letter one in terms of the frequency with which that's used and two the imminent ability of the parties to readily address that um the broader concern the way the letter actually terminates it says that if the city is not willing to honor the agreement as written then perhaps the time has come to renegotiate the interlocal agreement I think any attorney who has reviewed this including an attorney who spoke earlier this evening agrees it could benefit from a rewrite um obviously L the the it is not the most detailed um interlocal agreements memorialized such um what what residents I think from both communities consider uh very significant rights duties obligations and Privileges and I think in in navigating that it can it would benefit from more detailed text of course the challenge with any rewrite or exchange of any document or contract is the devil is in the you know the details if you will and what that looks like and what both parties might want want from that so that is the the not quite the penultimate sentence the second to last sentence then it says if the parties will not abide by the terms as written and the intended F SE of agreement is no longer serving the public purpose the town looks forward to the city's responses to these matters and a beneficial solution for both jurisdictions my advice as your legal counsel is if both parties agree that the real problem here is the interlocal agreement then what we should do first is see if we can achieve a rewrite revision uh modification of that agreement on terms that are beneficial to both parties and more explicitly memorialize the party's terms the con the the letter that was sent um does not threaten litigation um at least not at this stage I talked to their um Council that's not the posture at this time there are very specific parameters for how jurisdictions go about that we're not there yet I believe that this is a situation it is conflict and my role my goal with any conflict is to end it um and to find a resolution that benefits my client and that's what we're working to do I have been in contact with the city manager about this we've talked about this at length both when immediately when I received it and in the days following I had contacted it was in fact in reaching out to their Council um attorney Kardash to discuss this that I learned that she was not with the firm um and so that's uh obviously when you've had that kind of somewhat abrupt turn over the priorities in the community flipped for a moment and that wasn't the highest priority last week and I was traveling last week as well um and so with that this is it was the first call I made this morning um especially knowing I was coming and planning to speak to you this evening I had intended originally to speak to you about this last Monday when our meeting was was unexpectedly canceled and then I left the very next day left town that was the reason why it was not presented to you in that time um so that was uh that was the posture there but it was not held um from you to achieve any other end than to allow for me to provide you with the full context of its uh parameters and and and to seek to address and see what resolutions could be reached and get a better understanding from their Council what that party's position is at least at this time understanding either party's positions may change uh depending on the posture of it um there was some discussion tonight about the um mean water line and I would just for the benefit of member Banker is I know you like to to research these things and sometimes seek this the the coastal mapping section of the Florida statute Florida statute 17725 sorry no problem I'll provide this but Florida Statutes 17725 through 17740 provides definitions um delineates that the Department of Environmental Protection is responsible for establishing the mean High water line how that is done on what intervals and and what the significance of those terms as they are traditionally used um that's where that where that par Lance comes from of the mean high water the mean high water line which are two different things mean high water at least as statute by Statute is generally defined as that average over a 19-year period the mean high water line indicates where that average hits that that dry ground and then how that's administered um suffice to say there's not a fixed uniform point that sits EX ly X in or feet off of every single property in the State of Florida um and so that's um some context that doesn't solve the answer now that I can show you here it is on a map but just providing um some some guidance and insight uh on that issue um and those definitions are in 17727 sub4 and 15 for mean high water and mean high water line um I want to thank and commend the SBC student if you're still here sir a fantastic presentation earlier um fantastic attention and detail it is never easy or enjoyable uh to navigate such dense regulations and try and provide some context and Clarity especially where they are Inc consistent Community to community and you try to figure out how did we get here um I've learned often in my career you're not it's not always clear how we got here we don't always make them sometimes we just fly them um so I'd like to commend that student for their really diligent work and reaching out to public officials to get more inside that that's commendable will not a lot of people um do that level of diligence I think that should be commended um as I review my notes I believe those were the most significant things I wished to address in my report but as always I'm happy to answer any questions or address any issues you'd like me to council any questions for the City attorney why were we given that letter I like to get a copy you certainly will get a copy of it the why was simply I received it and intended to provide you the context uh immediately at that meeting last Monday um when I traveled I just I didn't want to give you something and then make myself unavailable to discuss it uh it warrants discussion uh also given the attention that this um that to the extent there's been conflicts between the two jurisdictions I thought it warranted addressing openly so that there would not be some um perception that I was telling you and only you um I was was planning to present it in a public forum uh for your knowledge and consumption and also I wanted the opportunity to discuss it with you um to contextualize it rather than say hey here's a letter I've got call me if you want this because I it is the knee-jerk reaction is of course what are you what is this about why are we fighting about this the city wasn't a party to this what are you doing and I think that rather than jump immediately to a fighting posture there is a solution here based on the way that it's written that the solution is a renegotiation of the agreement and I think all parties involved agree no pun intended that the agreement could be done better so maybe that's the near-term solution and seeing if that can be done before everybody simply retreats to um you know points of conflict and and and their fighting posters well they have in my opinion do nothing I don't believe they follow the uh inter local agreement they took away our barking uh violations and I I don't think you can make money all as a trustee I don't think you can profit all the trust in the state of flid I don't know where that uh revenue's going when they're sing people for paring tickets and that's not your problem not not at this stage and perhaps those are the sorts of things that that warrant addressing in the process and that's because my client is not one person I have I I serve a board I I would not want to go to them having spoken individually to each of you without you also having having the benefit of that discourse with each other which is the other reason I wanted to present it publicly because if any one of you simply told me your position and said well you know what of it well I work for the majority of this of this body and and forgive me member Shaw Elliott as I'm not making eye contact with you through this uh platform but I work for all of you and I wanted to make sure all of you had the opportunity to receive the information discuss it with each other if you desired but at this stage my intention and is to um make contact with their current attorney um and I've already done that today and I committed to him that once I'd spoke with my client this evening I'd be in a better position to see if my suggested course of action is what my client wanted so that we could explore solutions from there who's your current um Dan I'm sorry I'm GNA let me just pull up the letterhead so I can say Daniel there it is um Daniel Lewis is the attorney from the person in con Law Firm who is presently um filling in I will say just as a professional courtesy to Mr Lewis as you might imagine when one of your colleagues suddenly departs who's serving multiple Municipal clients he is drinking from several fire hoses um but he was kind enough to make time for me both last week I contacted him the Monday that our meeting was cancelled um and he was not in a position to substantively discuss if he committed to speak a week from that day and then we spoke this morning um when we're talking about the high means order Mark right about the 19 year average yes it's in the frequent Beach goer I know at least twice I've been told four times I seen him right after d and guys go out and Survey but this last time I've actually seen guys who survey going one the properties of B for better readings I go talk to him I said like what are you doing you know I know they're surveying way out what you doing with the data we give it to the count all right and that's all again but they always say but you're losing more and more and more me each time so I wrote to the I wrote to all the County Commissioners today about this prod and giving me some kind of a definition of where there highs is in the 19e survey because where do we sit and lie on the beach anymore if you live between first and 19th Street b beach um I go down the highway I cross the yellow line I get sighted for that but I know there's a line there telling me to stay here all right so this is a real Point Mr you need that answer you should call Kelly Le she's gotten back to me there and I to her about it and the canic they're not going to answer your questions cuz they only know answers well and they get using the Kelly we really don't get an answer from her either yes direct and in addition to the county it may be that the en Department of Environmental Protection or its Regional Outpost here locally might be in a position as well I'm happy to look into the issue in a broader sense to see if there's just a half but the the the fact is that it is because it is a point based on an average over time it is it is a fixed point that can and does change um and so that I I can understand the challenge and frustration there um I don't administer I'm just explaining it you'll probably get a copy from actually contact with office this is just uh actuallyy I I spoke with the Attorney General's office and they will not be engaging in that because they don't give legal advice to individual elected officials thank you Mr um what do you think the um the direction of their new attorney do you think that they're as far as renegotiating the the agreement do you think that that's something that they suest that the attorney suggested or do you think it's coming from their their I'm not going to speculate because I simply don't know and I don't know that it'll be fruitful or or constructive for me to do so what I will say is whomever it's coming from the letter as written could have ended a lot of different ways it ended with perhaps we need to renegotiate this agreement um there was a a member of the public spoke at length tonight and said this is a poorly written agreement paraphrase um and and so I think if if multiple people can look at this and say this can be better that to me seems like well there's a lowest common denominator here among the cited problems and so I know that in my view that I think that's the best course of action and speaking with the attorney who's presently um serving as a town attorney I get the impression as well that if an amicable solution can be reached that's the preference at this stage absolutely um and and also you know it in as much as there is a financial demand in here the second issue is sort of as to the parking is resolved by addressing the interlocal agreement um and again the dispute there is that according to the interlocal agreement in in in its vagaries um it says that the parking shall be for the use of benefit of the residents and Property Owners east of G Boulevard you know in Beller Beach I think the letter of the law and that there's an argument to be made that even as our temporary per program exists though it is not often used it is always for the benefit of a resident right it is joeo can't walk off the street John do can't walk in and say I want one of these you have to establish that you're a property owner I think their's well that's not quite the spirit of that or perhaps how it's written from their view but regardless an interlocal agreement revision May well address that so the only real dispute here is the funds that I I again my my position is I don't believe they're legally entitled to them um I think it's used as a it maybe us is an incentive to come to the negotiating table but I don't think based on my experience with you as a client that there's some great reluctance in this community to renegotiate I think there's a desire and and renegotiate doesn't necessarily just mean come to New terms come to better clearer terms um and again the challenge will be as in any negotiation or renegotiation that was in the details it's not clear what either party wants from that they didn't say we want to renegotiate the intercal agreement and here's our List of Demands it said we need something better than this cuz this keeps problems and that seems to be true is true um so you know when and that came up when we talked about Towing that came up when we talked about gate accesses and things that this Council has discussed or versioned of it over the past three years anytime we've talked about those Becks as it comes out to well the agreement doesn't quite say this so we got to find out what their position is we can memorialize and address a lot of those potentially and again I think that there's value in seeing if an amicable resolution can be reached in terms of just get reaching a better work product as for our have any questions or comments no I've actually contacted DP probably a couple years ago and obviously that 19 year average is an elevation so it's an elevation I'm assuming I haven't seen the report that's takes into account sea level so it might be- 2.5 ft below sea level so it is an elevation and when you get that most current 19-year aage you can simply go out there on the beach set up a survey instrument and anywhere that that level is is where that line would be and it's going to vary just like we've talked about from house to house because the sand levels could vary a lot somewhat or none at all and so that line isn't going to be a straight line from 1 to 19th it's going to be based on the elevation of the sand levels there and that's where it is and they probably updated I'm guessing maybe monthly over that 19 19 year average or it could be annually over that 19e average and I I do wish to address one issue as it relates to that in as much as where that line is is affecting where beach goers can enjoy the the beach um without being moved or disturbed in as much as that's being started as as a function of a code violation if you will code enforcement um under chapter 162 of fora statutes provides that if a complaint is made that it cannot be anonymous absent certain exent circumstances but it doesn't prevent proactive policing of your codes um you you're not limited to enforcing your codes only when a complaint is made um you can proactively uh go through your community and say we didn't receive a complaint this was done on a proactive basis and that's true whether it's tall grass for those things so I just in as much as that's a concern I do want to make sure that's clear council member Elliot do you have any comments or questions yes one of each um and I just wanted to thank our City attorney MOA for his professionalism throughout this whole process and we know that you uh represent us very diligently and in a very respectful way and so um I for one remain very very confident in in your representation of us and look forward to hearing more about these issues I do have a question about the result of the election and that concerns uh the section 2.07 regarding uh meetings um know that that provision passed and that the quum for a meeting um is based on a majority of the council uh and we know also that the the membership of the council has been reduced to five but it's for a period in the future so what is the effective date of the the Quorum provision that takes effect immediately the quum language was part of the um the quum language was not contingent on um another date it is um as it reads it's a majority of the council shall constitutive quum if the council is composed of five members six members or seven members in any given time then that's the council I would interpret that as the council as seated um and so a majority of the council otherwi and so in that context um as I interpret that it's acceptance provide the language now says acceptance provided in 2.06 C which is your provision governing vacancies a majority of the council shall constitute a quum so a majority of the five six or seven or four as it is now three of you is a majority that's a quorum right now that's all we need and then it says no action of the council shall be valid unless adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the council the same language so at least if only three of you show up all three of you are going to need to approve a measure because that's a majority of the council so it's the same par so it should it should yield the same result the same math so that's that's how that leads out so March 19th when the voters voted full Charter yes sir and I and I feel to mention that in my report thank you for reminding that what I'm saying is that we went to a three person 19 based on your present composition of four yes so and why was the meeting canel week the meeting was canceled last week at the request of the presiding officer based on a u with the charter clearly says the senior council member will run meeting that was not that was not a a legal interpretation I provided on that the the meeting was cancel but our Charter is our legal interpretation of how we run the city and that and if we had three people for quum that mean should have never been canceled this okay I don't know why we have Charter if we're not going to file the charter then why happen the other question I have is What's the statute limitations on filing an appeal on any Charter amendments that because I can't find it in our ordinances and I can't find it in our Charter and I think if it's b or missing is it statute I I don't provide legal advice to people on how to challenge the ordinances well I'm just asking is there statute file because people have asked people are are free to pursue their own legal remedy if they feel that something should be challenged um that's not that comes statute of limitations as you stated comes from Florida Statutes and that is not a me matter of the city's ordinance or Charter as to when a legal challenge can be commenced I'm just asking is there is it in our orance that you know that you can time it is in Florida Statutes I believe there is there's one period based on based on how soon you do it changes the standard of review for the challenge I've handled such challenges in the past for other communities there isn't fact stat implementations I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of all of them I believe it's somewhere between four and 5 years and then after like six years then it's more differential or something of the sort I may be off on my numbers but yes there's a statute governing uh statute of limitations for legal challenges of ordinances um and I don't know what it is specific to Charter amendments when you have a ballot measure that might be in more restrictive statute of limitations as opposed to a legislative enactment of the council and and and the other reason I asked is I went to the Florida Le cities about this I hope people can hear me and they told me it goes to your ordinances ashity okay well so well be that as it may I not everybody in the Florida leag is a litigator well that's why they said go city right not everybody's a litigator with the Florida Le of cities I would tell you as a litigator again generally speaking your legislative enactments your ordinances and resolutions are subject to those statutory schemes I've not had occasion to handle a legislative uh or a legal challenge to a um ballot measure I I know of them being litigated I've not had one where I've had to specifically defend it so I just don't I can't answer that here it wasn't a question I was supposed to me before this moment thank you any other questions no and Miss Elliot I appreciate your comments your appreciation for Mr MOA I uh I will agree with that 100% all right thank you very much Mr MOA and I appreciate the detailed report now we are on to item number nine city manager report Mr Freer thank you mayor so this report is slightly dated because we had the postponement of the meeting but the um we actually do have the amendment to the Indian Rocks uh piggyback agreement for theic project and that is later on the agenda so we'll discuss that um when we get to it the uh stormw Improvement project I just made a note that March 19th the city passed out the door hangers um notifying the residents of the corresponding streets of the project that project was taking place and that there would be future notifications coming the contractor but um giving them contact information with the city um if any problems do arise and if you haven't seen it already um the contractor has started u cutting away the curve moving it um already get dried they have started on the North End of the project um but they still maintain that they will uh move to the southern end if we feel like uh we've come to a decision point on that um so that we can take care of some of the uh areas of the city have uh the flooding wor soon before hurricane season comes around um then they've also had the C contractor who's been cleaning out the oysters and marles and the pipes they they starting that process um and then once they get the cleaning done they should move forward to the uh cure and place uh pipe um which I think is important to get done because to fix the pipes that we know that have we is and uh infiltration and the code project for our next work session which is going to be on April 22nd um we are going to cover the remaining remaining chapters um so that's going be 7074 78 82 86 and 90 um we're actually going to incorporate the uh the influence sign orance in that uh work session as well so um Mr sh is prepared for that and we will be passing out the outlines like and um full chapters for your review and lastly um the RFP for AUD AUD and Services I have on here April 4th that the audit committee was going to meet um that got delayed due to the appointment of the committee members um so our new date is set for April 16th next week and at that meeting will be reviewing the uh RFB that's going to go out shortly after and um they review the audit itself and it will be presented in um and then just as a note I am going to be out of the office April 23rd through the 26th go to the Florida flood plane management conference I will Beil and working that's all I have I do have a here a question right quick concerning the documentation we s out baby um I believe it was the results of the survey concerning pumps and storm water drainage would you like to just kind of briefly touch on that so I've been um kind of queuing uh the C city engineer Larry floody to get um us the report that we've been asking for um at the recommendation of the manufacturer they came up with a double pump design so we started um with a design that incorporated two pumps in case one pump um is not working correctly the system still works um based on the numbers it's it you know it's a price your project for that reason um and it also involves uh where you have to use structures um that are cast in place concrete because they have to be designed fit the pumps um one of the options in talking to the engineer was you know y I'm asking is is there way we can run up a one pump system and um try to reduce the cost of the project and that is in his memo that I sent as well um what what he he was explaining so he gave us a the cost estimates for this two pump system um for two locations which is 9th street and then um the 7th eth Street area and both those projects can be done independent but I just wanted to make sure we incorporated both areas but what he is going to do now is try to fit a one pump into a pre-cast um structure um to make the project simpler to try to ruce that cost so that is what we're waiting for but I wanted to get the report out that that he has currently just he had some numbers and something look at um and also you know to send me questions so I can get that information back and forth as much as possible because we we do have a lot of residents that are concerned about our when we're going to make this decision and they want to have the storm water project improvements from currently nth Street Cedar all right questions from the council yes sir um K on this that's great news the storm water Improvement projects has started baring any Act of gods that God is there any U timetable the contractor is estimated and then we're not going to go to the be to the from the start to the Finish I mean there's optimistic talk of 6 months but I can't I Anything Can Happen correct correct thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager just yes I I have several um thank you uh Mr manager for confirming that uh the contractor is prepared to to move South um when conditions require that um obviously those of us that are south of the caway have a great deal of concern about the impending storm season and we want to be prepared for that as as as quickly as possible um I wasn't clear on when we will be receiving a final report do we have a date for that I don't have an exact date um I will push for it to get done this week so that you guys have the report to look at um and then he has already committed to representing um you know his firm and answer any questions at the next work session on the 22nd okay on 22nd board meeting but what about the working meeting will we have something to discuss at the working meeting the 2 second is the work session oh I'm sorry all right forgive me all right good all right that's that's good appreciate that um and then with regard to the Cod review uh just wanted to emphasize chapter 86 regarding signs is the one where I think we had a lot of concern um which is interesting because we don't have a lot of science here in our town but um we had talked about it before and at least my comment before was that let's look for ways that we can simplify it so that we have something that is um easily communicated should someone come to the front desk and say I'd like to get permit for a sign we have something that's easy to communicate to them for what those rules are so that would be my comment about that as we ready for that meeting and I think when we looked at it before we talked about getting some revisions to that um to that ordinance rather than the one that was most recently proposed I attorney have any view on that U thank you member sha Elliot uh I will uh first address the point you weren't asking me that I failed to address in my report which is to say there was some discussion about the one-year look back period being prioritized I advised you at our last meeting that that would be put before the Planning and Zoning Board before it went to you that already has been that board is meeting on Wednesday and we have um subject to the body app pointing uh members tonight um and that ordinance is one of the things they'll be looking at at Wednesday's meeting uh to your question concerning the sign code um we've had discussions about that in the past um both when you were a member of the uh of the Planning and Zoning Board and also um as part of this Council um as far as simplifying if that can be done in in each instance I've asked for um specific guidance Beyond I just want it clear um and I only say that because while it may seem simple to some the this change is being made in response to Supreme Court Juris Prudence um that Supreme Court opinion does not have a majority opinion a series of morality opinions it's proy since then has made some clarity but what we're trying what we've provided you the simple um instruction was we need to fix our sign code um what my firm drafted and provided was admittedly the most robust approach if you want something more strict down we can do that I just want to make sure I understand uh from a client need standpoint on what you consider essential what you consider Superfluous so I can better um provide you a work product that better meets your expectations to date the the instruction is simply been something else um and I'm happy to provide that but I don't want to work in um futility and so any if you have if any of you having reviewed it wish to speak to me individually to give me your thoughts Reflections and we can recirculate what was the previous draft as we as we approach that but that's um that's where that stands thank you Mr Baker uh Kyle if B shes reaches out to you about that letter and says hey we're going to reduce our fees $9,900 you have toay grand would you notify us that toay of course thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager thank you Mr Reaper thank you may' next up City cler rep how you good how are you

Engineers you met my wife says I like to talk to a wall talk to a w matter what conclusion I'm friendly trustworthy fairm minded and would love the opportunity to serve this community thank you very much thank you Mr willings we have questions from the council yeah just a comment I did have an opportunity to speak with Andre as well he was uh when he answered the phone he was in uh West yeah I was sailing back from uh for laudale on on his vote and he was hoping to make it back for last Monday um he did make it back but we changed the meeting so he had plenty of time so I sailed like 36 hours straight so he would have been exhausting to show up at that meeting but either way we're glad you're here today Mr B do you have any questions I want to just thank all three of you for uh one of the questions about why we had Charter changes was we could find enough candidates you guys will approve this wrong well I I agree with thank you do you have a question um Andress you've heard tonight some of the issues that we're looking at as a council uh including the storm water project signage uh neighborhood issues uh uh what in your background would give you specific um skill to bring to resolution of those shes I certainly feel like you I'm a mechanical engineer I've done fluidics a long long time dealing with flid flowing through pipes and system like that so I I think that can bring a very practical approach to that I I definitely like to definitely ANH reader I will read deep into the topics I definitely like to um I won't say all the topics that are on the table right now and so but I do need I have the time I will have the time to get up to speed on all the topics and uh I definitely like to thoroughly research things before I W up my mind I have a question if there was something uh that you could change immediately correct or make better in b beach what would be the first thing on your radar um I think uh I'm very I'm on 8th Street right there so I'm very familiar with some of the flooding issues so I think that would be top of mine for me e and Ninth streets any other questions I do have one statement to make and sometimes when we're making these decisions we have very good qualified candidates which is the case again so I don't think there's any losers here sometimes we have to look at little tiny things one of the things that we don't often think about is the actual physical location of our council members because we represent the whole city but it goes without saying that when we're close to certain streets that it's easier for us to stay in contact with them find out what how they feel about issues that we're goinging on things like that so um just something to consider I know we have a couple people in the south south of of Crossway um I'm on I'm on 20th Dave is further to the north and I know David is 15th Street so we're kind of getting spread out here which I think is a nice thing just my opinion yeah and the fact that I'm on the south south of beach I think wouldn't bias me sure how it would I definitely want to review PA parts of our community that great Fair minded where the resources are needed any other questions just to note our Charter clearly says council at large so it doesn't say we can all live on one street we want to put WS in it let's put WS in it that's all right so I have to ask you the uh the final questions uh which is Are you a qualif registered voter yes uh qualifying physical resident yes and qualifying permanent resident yes and qualify by civil rights yes thank you very much thank you okay we still have the opportunity if you have any other questions for prior uh candidates if you would like to ask them any more questions before we end this portion of it now is the time good council member Elliot no thank you okay great all right so now what we're going to do is we're going to uh vote by paper ballot um actually we're not going to do that just yet hold on one second now it's time for the council to or the public to speak would anyone like to address the council uh with these three candidates yes sir please come right on that give us your name and address I'm question Senor and I just wanted to add one more thing he didn't bring up is his grandfather served for City Council here and myself I served 20 years ago so he's been here since he was born I've been here since 65 so we got a little long history in the city and we really really care about it and so he's very interested I think he really bring up this whole bio they came up here so they said quite as much as they should have but there's a lot of history thank you Mr Prescott any other citizen comments yes we were wondering where you were Joy Shirley 207 Harrison Avenue I want to thank all three candidates I think they're all great but I do want to go into um just quickly say Doug I've known Doug all his life he's been a great kid it's nice to see the younger generation get involved his son my son and him are the same age and it's just nice to see getting um some some young folks involved so I know there may be some opportunity I don't I don't know I mean I thought I had heard that maybe we were adding three members tonight am I miss did I misunderstand something there we still have to make a motion on that and uh my proposal was one because of the fact that uh majority large majority of the community said five is uh is what we'd like to have and we are not required to fill all seats so that was that was my goal okay just saying if we did have to fill all seats I think that we have three great candidates so thank you guys for considering them all thank you I take offense to the young thing too by the way all right uh so now it's time to vote uh basically uh with the way that this is working I guess what you would do is one two three I do think that that would be the appropriate way to handle this okay and then uh after we take the vote uh Renee will present the the count and then someone will make a motion to move forward guess by you Miss Elliot I believe you'll have to vote my voice did we lose her not connected you want to try call just going to have to take for it as number one there ranking then 1 two okay thank you oh she's back and I'm back there is no Clear Window results sorry M cler um we need to read the results as to how each member Ved okay okay so Miss Elliot ranked them Anders Wellings first David tenan second Doug Prescott third and then council member Banker voted them all equally as one mayor gtis chose Doug Prescott as one Anders Wellings as two and David tenan is three council member Roberts chose David tenan as one Anders Wellings as two and Doug not S3 Mr how do you interpret this well there's a few ways that if you wanted to go the way to GPA one there's one way I would suggest instead that however many people you're going to Appo you have to start with one all right you're filling at least one vacancy tonight you not necessarily reached a conclusion on that so it may be beneficial to all pick one member on another ballot rather than do the ranked Choice since you're not filling multiple seats and see if that yields any clear majority decision um in light of that if you wish to do a separate second round of voting that way do it that way um ultimately the stewards of this process for the charter are the commission is the council Council fills the VAC so it's ultimately your decision on how to proceed but given that you're at least filling the first vacancy um it may be the ranked voting approach is um not most suitable at this time um noting one member chose not to use that approach either so um it may it may be best to take a different approach to yeld with different results let's do another round the ballots and we'll start with just the first thank you m we just make for council member Elliot would you like to vote by voice yes if that's the process uh I love for honors well okay so in this round council member Elliot selected Anders Wellings council member Lloyd Roberts selected David tenan mayor gtis selected Doug Prescott and council member Banger selected them all so just for clarity sake section 2.06 C of the charter sets a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council we have four members of the council so majority vote would be three of you um any person appointed by Council fill a vacancy will hold office and we've already discussed all that so at this stage um it is um ultimately again your process it sounds to me based on the way that the Voting is working that there may be some value before you go back to the ballots and having a discussion as a body on what your goal is here tonight and how you intend to proceed Council well we have an over suggestion of quitting one person in on but it's not been moot it hasn't been motioned or it hasn't been approved so right now our Charter clearly says seven members um so I don't know how we can V for one I don't know how we can vote for two um again we have three people that want to serve counsel Charter says we can put them on why would we want to tell them not to serve on Counsel I I don't understand it I mean I don't think the voters have a the voters said we can reduce it to five voters didn't say we have to reduce it to five their terms going to be up at the end of this session so just put them on well I think it does make sense to listen to the citizens I realized Mr Banker that we don't have to do this until the next election 26 November 26 but my perspective the way I look at it is the citizens voted by a pretty big margin that they wanted go to Five understanding that we don't have to it still makes the most sense to me to listen to the voters six six council members is not an option in my opinion we can't have an even number of council members so by definition it's one or three and I think because of what the citizens said I support the one thank council member Elliot would you like to weigh in on this um this is this is a con room is it not um um there certainly is no requirement that we fulfill full all positions um but Mr berer makes a good point in that they are there uh we have people that are willing to serve um um at the same time it also relieves some of the pressure on the voting issues to the extent that we have more at least during this inter room process um I can probably be I'm having difficulty coming down on a particular position on this one um but um I can supporting the way we've got we've got good people oning this Earth I'm sorry I say that last sentence we have good people willing to serve amen all right and uh I am aligned with with Mr Roberts this is was my attempt was to go ahead and bring us forward so that it looks like the future of our Council what the citizens voted for uh I don't know how many out in this audience it was around 80 I think 82% something like that um the city has spoken uh so I uh am going to stand behind uh what I'm I'm trying to make happen tonight which is to go to a five member councel I'm I'm grateful for all three candidates being here um but I I don't think that seven is the direction that uh this needs to be doing any any further so what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to select one any other comments arm wrestle what's that arm wrestle arm wrestle right I'll go for that so what we uh what we need to do is vote again and uh yes in the past our Provisions in our Charter allows for drawing or straws and you may have to come to that no one's willing to give you may have to do that thank you let's do one more know it's we're really Beyond it but I'm going to she came up so let's uh let's here let's start with with Joe L three minutes take 12 I promise you so first off there's no motion on the floor mayor gtis if you want to make a motion you can make it you need to yield the floor to the most senior member cuz you don't have a vice mayor that would be frank Banker okay in terms of whether you put one two or three on I agree with Mr Robert you can't have either number so it's either one or it's three but what I find somewhat ironic is that this whole vote was sold to the voters on the idea that we can't get seven good people to run well three good people just stepped forward tonight so you've got seven and I'm with Frank bangard take them the way people have dropped off this Council for a variety of reason you can't have too many people on here and the extra debate is fine to Mr moa's point maybe this has changed since I was mayor but your Charter changes didn't become effective until they were filed with the secretary of state and if that is the case still that's what I was told because if you remember we changed the charter one time where the mayor was allowed to bring a motion and I was told we had to wait until the Secretary of State accepted it well either I was lied to which is a problem a civil rights problem so I hope I wasn't ly to or you turn changes aren't effective yet you have seven member Council so clarify it because the worst thing you could do is put people on this Council and find out that you did something wrong and everything you did is void please check this through and if you need to call a special session do this on another night this can wait one more night you do have enough for a and you can run the city business thank you Mr Mr Mora I'm not immediately aware of that I'm not saying that there's no such requirement I'm also not aware of what's been sent to whom at this stage administratively um so ultimately again I would I would defer to how you're proceeding I will continue to look into that concern as that's the first has been raised would someone like to T this uh this particular there's there's been no motion yet I'm sorry we had others yes Tammy lenda 97 Harper Drive for what it's worth um I'm I did vote to um decrease the council member down to five people and I know your your point saying this is what the citizens voted for but like the main reason was because no was running and it was a great fear that was kind of going around that you know Tallahasse would take over our city council would be diminished you know it would be taken out of our our hands locally so I I voted for it but I by no means have like issues with seven people on the council and and no one was running for so long and no one was stepping up so just for what it's worth um maybe people voted for different reason voted down to five people but I just wanted to reiterate that thank yes sir Mr McIntyre thanks har McIntyre 3040 High distri Drive um you know clearly the people did vote and said let's get this to five but I think we need to look Beyond just tonight just beyond the next year this is more of a long-term situation and when you compare this beautiful city you look at the number of of council members that have been on the board on the council it's greater than communities much much larger than us having seven has prevented us from getting business done here we can get good business done with five and the votes were supported by having five council members I think every council member should pick one and not try to muddy this up people have asked for five and I'd encourage Council to stick to that thank you Mr Mayor if I may interrupt um your Charter in section 9.01 States upon adoption of the charter amendment by majority vote of the electors Council shall have the amendment incorporated into the charter the revised Charter shall then be followed the FL Department of State and it will then be in effect that is how it reads in your chart um the chat the language from the for Statute in 16631 says adoption upon adoption of an amendment to the Charter of the municipality by a majority vote of the electors voting in a referendum upon such Amendment the governing body of said municipality shall have the amendment incorporated into the charter and shall file the revised Charter with the Department of State all such amendments are effective on the dates specified therein or as provided in the charter the date specified therein was immediately effective upon adoption however with the language in your Charter stating that all proposed amendments um shall then be filed with the Department of State and then be in effect um that would U militate that the Department of State must have it transmitted to them um I'm not clear whether or not that has happened as Mr Mayor that in light of that and in light of the stalemate that we've been in for the past few minutes here uh it name warrant tbling this matter to ensure that there's no issue thank you very much so would like to table this particular agenda I just one quick question if we didn't do that from what you stated earlier of the before we would still have to have three for one person um well uh that amendment was also part of the charter Amendment so I would recommend that you table this to qu any concern on what is and is not effect based on the Amendment and we can ensure that all this is promply and diligently transmitted to the Department of State po stes so my recommendation would be we have a special council meeting uh prior to our work session on the 22nd that may well be soon to give with that Mr Banker no I think we should proceed as the agenda still States um and follow the charter as the charter so States I mean let me read to you what you guys voted on shall the city amend the charter to provide for a council composited of five at large council members including the mayor comma as opposed to existing language providing for a city council composite of seven at large council members including them there and adjust the corresponding voting requirements for the council to take action question mark okay so it doesn't say we have to put this into effect today tomorrow next year we should have another meeting put this on the agenda to say that the five council members as the city electric voted should go into effect on a certain date that would be following our Charter that would be following amendment to and the language in the amendment does provide the name which is again because there were four separate amendments all of which were functionally inter related um and in my following the um following the election I did attempt to provide you with um not just the legal ease of it but a exposition of how it could how this process would work my legal advice has been nothing in the charter mandated that you only fill a single position uh the that is ultimately at the discretion of this Council as the council is the lone body responsible for filling vacancies so when I when asked in my FAQ phrase the electorate approved a council of five members right I said yes but not right away there there shall be a city council and then I I referenced the language and explained that the transition is Complicated by the fact that you presently have the three vacancies if the council presently had all seven positions filled the council would transition to a five member Council during the November 2026 election had there not been any form six vacancies you would have transitioned at the November 2026 election and you can still transition at the November 2026 election if that is the desire of the council um you can conversely and and I said you can f one 2 three and Sensibility being what it is um to fill with the even number um you you have that option my advice at this stage given that much of this is contingent on Charter amendments taking effect that we prompt we address the issue with the Department of State so there can be no question no challenge um you you suggested tabling it to the 22nd I think mayor member Banker your statement of we have another meeting I think is consistent with what the mayor has recommended it's simply in dispute as to what we'll be doing on that day whether you're filling one two or three which I think this body will have the opportunity to not just go by the Mandate of the election but as you talk to your constituents in the intervening time maybe perhaps gain some clarity on where you think this may need to go but I at this stage my advice to you would be to um to set this to a later date whether it be the second or otherwise to avoid any issue um as um even a member of the council suggested there may be legal challenges directed to these trer amendments but for clarity reasons putting three people on at night would not would not be violating anything the question at hand of Voters voted on gave exclusive rights for the council to choose a time place and date to Pro five I'm not I'm sure that I agree with how that was phrased but correct that if you filled all three positions tonight that would not presented is all right someone if you like to table this I would okay if that's the case I would suggest making a motion I move that we table this until some day in the future you might have a second are we going to do we want to make it a specific date I think it would be preferable to if given that we know we're convening weeks it may be preferable to state that and if we need to change it we can provide notice as appropriate so yes I think it would be my recommendation would be that we know we're already convening in 2 weeks perhaps setting that date to provide reasonable expectations and if we if we can't do it them then we can notice as did you get that I did in subject to that Envision then I would second that motion will is the maker of the motion willing to amend the motion to table it to the 22nd I am a second on the floor all in fav no I I I all right let's take is it I don't think it is it is because it's not it's not oh you're just Ling it I'm not loving it I'm loving what we presented to the people that we couldn't fill 7 SP we have let's put people want that want to serve Why why cast these people there's three great CS where out there why did I I'm not trying to push you guys back on but uh all I'm here is to give ADV decisions but we have three great people let's put them on we would have had these problems for the record if you would have took my suggestion in December and put two people on instead of one even though we knew the vice mayor was leaving within two weeks so this councils put themselves in a Qui Mar not FR B all I've done is follow the chart forgive me when we were discussing this also as somebody pointed out earlier a very very very large majority of the other towns similar to us as well as larger towns and cities have five Commissioners or council members we were one of the few that had s but nobody knows the real reason why it ever started with s but clearly the majority of the towns and cities in pelis County at least have five correct um I guess we're just stuck here until the 27 so we certainly do not have to stay stay here in a state of quantum indecision um if there is no clear majority there is no appointment made tonight and but a majority in this case actually is all four members if there's no if all four of you cannot come to an agreement then the matter simply fails and we can see if the matter can be Revisited at a sub we we need not sit in scalemate if there's no uh compromise for solution you have between the parties okay well would you mind passing out the ballots and uh let's vote for three candidates and um see what happens mayor I'm not clear on what the instruction is just so I know we can't um we cannot table because it requires a unanimous vote so we're still for 1 two and for 1 two and three or on all three candidates yes this for council member Elliot would you like to weigh in Connected okay so from Lloyd Roberts selected David tenan yes Doug Prescott no and Anders Wellies no mayor gtis selected no on all three council member Banker selected gave them all one rating and I don't have council member Elliot's vote at this time and by all just because of my no votes it dies we'll still need member Elliot's votes reported as she is otherwise generally been present for this meeting she's intending to remain present we should have her V rep but I agree with the conclusion are you calling can you hear me now yes I do apologize for that but um and I I must also apologize I missed once before the board the each council member has been directed to vote yes or no on the three candidates um you can vote Yes or No in any combination you so desire but uh the other members have voted and we need your vote for the record and what were the other votes everybody else voted on on a blind ballot it would be best if you state just read your your vote into the record oh I'm sorry um I apologize I the uh had been discussed so um I would vote for one and Mr Wellings so that's a yes as to unders Wellings and no as to the other two is that correct yes and I don't really see that as no in terms of within the within the Paradigm within we're work that we're working in in this moment with that mayor the matter fails at this point you have no clear can we get could we get the read of the to sure you read the last Doug Prescott no David tenan yes Andre Wellings no from council member Roberts mayor gtis selected no on all three council member Banker selected one on all three and council member Shaw selected yes Anders Wellings and no for David tenan and D all right item 16 nomination and election of vice mayor by ballot before we open this to the council let's go to the citizens for comments who would like to speak yes 8 Street flid I would like to encourage this Council to nominate council member ly Roberts for vice mayor and vot for ly Roberts for vice mayor he's very highly respected in this community and is definitely an asset and that's what I hope the council does thank you thank you other citizens you like to speak yes sir Jame history I'd like to actually off myself uh he is well respected he has the expertise he knows how to run the city and it's one of the others yes mer 111 Street um I would like to also recommend Roberts to voted to ice mayor position he does listen to Residents and concerns that they have Council and I'm feel here as the best candidate to provide support to the mayor and the citizens of B Be thank you other citizen comments yes Mr Mano this one's not even close there's one person who works for the citizens in this adds up for this nomination there's one person who went and reached out to the attorney general when the beach umbrellas and shade was taken away from all of our citizens there's one person who busted his back and took nothing but grief when he tried to protect the citizens of this city from motor boers and other motorized vehicles in the swim zones he was vilified I know the feeling but it doesn't stop him he performs every time he's prepared every time we just saw it tonight he knew the charter where's the rest of the people are supposed to know the charter where's the rest of the people that are supposed to be reading the ordinances there's one person who deserves to be the vice mayor he has proven it time and time again the big Law Firm has the thing for the people there's one person for the people here Frank bankr is that person and you know what your vote for Frank bord says a lot about you not about Frank because those of us who know what Frank does for the people we know that he's a fighter and whether he's vice mayor or he's the newest council member he's always going to be there for the citizens I wholly endorse you Frank I hope that this Council does too you would be a great Buzz there thank you yes sir can take me 121 12 Street um I've never met Frank um he clearly knows um B and Beach the charter and he's a Frank outspoken pardon the p a person who says what it means that's what I like so you got endorsement thank you yes ma'am um I strongly recommend Mr Benard because I've seen how he loves his job what he's doing with the situation of my house he came to me in that morning 7:00 in the house and said I'm going to look around and see where you leave let me take a look on the situation even he said Iris I can sit here with you and draft the letter and even he did not stop there he called pel's county is that correct Mr vaner and trying to resolve the matter he tried to hit the walls for me and for my family so you deserve that position and even better thank you for what you do I appreciate that God bless you thank you other comments all right citizen comments are closed all right um I'm going to need a motion from the council to nominate and elect a vice mayor someone like to make a motion motion motion by Frank Baker do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts Mr B you have the floor yes first of all um I really want to thank all the people that wrote in today yesterday um supporting me believe I'm over 40 residents and sending emails um I didn't know there was a letter writing campaign told my neighbor notified uh the city Friday um I got a bad foot would thought um but uh I love this city right and I guess the mayor thinks I'm sticking it to him by not proceeding unlawfully this is this is the whole problem go read the newspapers and I'm not going to mention anybody's name but there's a guy that's sued done eating there's a guy sued madira Beach because they did it wrong some of this lawsuits were over $150,000 in Awards and damages I caught ER actually six three just tonight of Charter Provisions that we were going to go now I think we should have a vice mayor that's loves the city not saying Ro doesn't he's a great man all right but someone that really wants to Serve the People lawfully and wants to get into what the city and Charter is all about if you don't want the charter I don't think he can remove it when you need to follow it we we have all these ordinances and the charter is for the counil to follow like the Constitution of the United States so in in the State of Florida I mean I really it doesn't well I really would like to be vice mayor okay but it's just a title doesn't give me any more doubt but I think I deserve it I'm the your council member here I volunteered 10 for 10 years at every event I've been asked for I've never I've missed one beach clean up since since the existence I mean sand bag there every year helping the residents out it has nothing to do with the vice mayorip it just shows that I am in tune with this city and love the city even though there's some people that hate me because I made allian with some people they don't like well God told me to do that all right so if you have a problem with that go talk to Jesus Christ and God all right I am glad I made alliances with people that uh other people don't like and I'm glad I can call other people residents friends whatever that is a great thing I think is Congress like that's all I said council member La do you have any comments um I do um uh I I want to say that um I will be voting for Mr Roberts but for uh several reasons one is part of this role is to be able to assist the mayor and I think that there would be a good working relationship there the other side of it is that um I truly appreciate respect and encourage Mr Bard's Independence his diligence his expertise um there's no question in terms of his commitment and his his interest in doing the right thing um I think uh we can preserve that Independence and he can continue to be that voice that um brings out the issues and um I just want to encourage that as well as the fact that I just want to get something resolved so that will be my vote thank you for your L comments um I um I won't say that I was on the fence but I was actually I up until today I wouldn't have had a problem with either person being the vice mayor um because I know have the two gentlemen on each side of you I know that're go to back for the city they're going to do what they can for the city um and then I got a copy of an email where Frank bankard was asking for people to write in letters and he gave all the reasons why uh they should support it and get behind it and I was a little taken back with uh one of the SES right in the middle of this huge look at me and all I've done paragraph um which was uh I further was able to move a change in our ordinance of the 5year look back rule by thema to one year regarding cost of modification and damages to homes um what I realized was that I I don't see Mr Banker as a team player I see Mr Banker as someone who um it's his way or no way and um and it's this this letter made it all about him there was no team it wasn't the council did this it wasn't it wasn't about what a great job this Council has done in the last few years and and how well we worked together it was all about fr and it really uh it bothers me U so unfortunately Frank after reading this I I will not be able to support you I realize we're not uh we're not going to reach a unanimous vote and um and I respect everything that you do except for uh your your tactics of of dealing with this Council well I'm sorry but I've been researching the ordinances and Charter and I can't find we teaming um we voted we vote for seven people when I V okay with individual thoughts and damn me for having an individual thought okay um if you want a team let's reduce it to just a kingdom all right and then you can just get everything passed okay but yes I did get counsel like I said to the person to move on that one year set setb and um we were we were going to wait until uh probably October no finally gets passed and I brought up at the last meeting it's on the audio that I did this and it was we know exactly what you did and and that's fine I agree with you on it however um it's you have led everyone in this to believe that every one of these accomplishments on here is all about you tell me which one isn't I wrote no I wrote the letter I know tell me which one that uh also you didn't know that there was an email campaign going on and right there it is I said I thank my neighbor for informing me there was going to be an email campaign Friday night I got an email from the city clerk I sent an email out uh Saturday okay well um and I think that I think the emails clearly says over 40 to what 7 or eight I mean but hey don't do what the voters want do what you want Dave yeah that's right and I'm going to do what the voters want okay for that for now okay do we have any other comments the council I'm I appreciate the support that I got earlier tonight um I for one never send an email to anyone so I really feel good about the fact that people were writing to the city unsolicited so thank you to whoever did those I appreciate it um as the mayor said he feels comfortable that both of us have the skill sets the knowledge the capability to do this job um I I know I can and and would love to have the opportunity there was and I wasn't going to really delve into to this email cuz I got the same email as the mayor did but the final sentence is the one that made me very not happy would said that he was the only council member that did not say that we view this as a thankless job I have never said that in my life nor would I ever but the most important thing that I feel the best about regarding being what I was able to achieve here at the city was the fact that when I was elected and I I just kind of wondered why in our meeting that we did not open the meeting with a prayer of invocation and when I brought it up other people supported it Frank supported it but that that just needed to happen because when we had this meetings I I'm confident that when we open it with a prayer he's listening and he's happy that we're involving him in this meeting we're asking for his help and direction so that was a huge thing and it makes me feel fulfilled that we were able to do that thank you any other comments from the council no all right uh let's take it to a vote for council member Elliot would you like to record your vote for the record Mr Roberts council member bankard voted for bankard mayor gtis voted for Roberts and council member Roberts voted for Roberts thank you all right so we're obviously not getting anywhere on this uh I would say that we need to add this agenda item to uh the 22nd meeting also Mr Mora are you uh are you sure that uh the data will have been transmitted from our election results we will make every effort to see that that is done if there's any reason that can't be done in that timeline we will leave that all right thank you very much all right now we'll leave over to to item 17 I select two council members

and approval to execute purchase order Mr reer thank you mayor so this um this is an amendment to the pig agreement that we signed in September of 2022 um which allowed us to be the IND each contract with uh utility Consultants of Florida um at the that um they submitted to IND rocks um you youf is the ination so UCF has done our conduit for um for Duke Energy phases one and they're also charged to do the conduit installation for Phase 2 um this um they've volunteered to give us a price after seeing The Binding cost agreement from Spectrum um to to the which would be north of cosmic Boulevard east side of Golf Boulevard with the remaining segment of spectrum communication that needs to be undergrounded they came in um Spectrum offered to do it with their um subcontractors for about 90,000 and uh UCF came in below that but in order to honor um the very uh great ricing that they provided um we had to do an amendment to the to the piggy agreement um the benefit to them though is um they're already out there they're already mobilized they are doing the cond for Duke Energy or any so to them they um they feel that um you they work with the city for a long time and also it works their benefit to make sure that no other subcontractors out there installing the conduit they could possibly hit their Duke Energy conduit um so this is just an amendment to that agreement which again allows us to use the pricing um and then the following agenda item is the actual uh Spectrum approval for once um UCF puts the cond in the ground and then the remaining prices first P run their wires and conect them all which you see if can't do that the utility compan to do that so um y I included the original payback agreement and then estimate um for installation from Spectrum are the are the the estimate from a UCF and U for your review and then the amendment was drafted by our City attorney thank you let's go to the citizens for comment would anyone like to speak on this topic no citizen comments are closed uh I need a motion from the council to authorize the city manager to amend the piggyback agreement and to ex the purchase order so motion made by Lloyd Roberts second by Frank Banker Mr robbert you before yeah I mean it's obviously a significant cost savings to me it's no this council member Elliot um I could use a little more information so we know that Spectrum bid 90,000 then the UCF came in at $1,600 less than that so I understand those numbers the total request is for almost $150,000 so uh explain to me what the difference is are you looking at um which item are you looking at cuz if you look at the first item that we were just discussing um yeah they came in below what spectrum's um sub contractors quoted um so the piece that UCF would be doing would be the $88,500 WR forther quote to install nwire um was 23658 so it's 90 90,000 even so we still the that second G item is just a remainder of the cost to actually wire once the condent installed is this the project that we received a grant for we gave reimbursement from penny for pelas so it's not exactly a grant but it's dedicated funds and it was dedicated for beautification project so yes all right thank you any other questions no all right let's vote all in favor I any oppos Miss Elliott I didn't hear your vote five okay motion passes Mr reer you may receive all right uh number 23 consider author authorizing the execution of a purchase order with Charter Communications Mr Reaper I think you just covered this but this is just um per our purchasing um requirements you know over a certain amount needs to be approved by city council this is a a a purchase order that only Charter Communications can actually offer for the service so it's just the official approval to execute the purchase order to get the wiring done all right thank you very much citizens anyone like to speak on this topic citizen comments are closed I need a motion from the council to authorize city manager to execute this purchase order so Roberts and Baker Mr Roberts comments um is this Mark Mark Porter with Consultants of Florida right and then Spectrum communication um his name right now but yeah um there this is to finish up their job on the east side I had met with him before um very skilled understands what we need to do support you any other comments I just want to mention also when we did the south of CER Boulevard section and we Ed the Spectrum subcontractors we did end up in a lot of delay on things left open for very long call the submiss wir"
