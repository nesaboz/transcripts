    "transcript": "all right good evening everyone it is now 6m this the city council work session for the city of belir beach All Rise the flag of the United States of America and to the repblic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible Liberty justice for all would you please call the council member Frank bankard pres council member Lloyd Roberts council member Kim Shaw Elliot present mayor Dave gtis here city manager Kyle reer here and City attorney Randy MOA present thank you Renee all right we have a couple of items that we're dealing with tonight first item is the code review chapter 77478 8286 and 90 Mr Reaper you have thank you mayor um so we're going to run through these code chapters pretty much the same way we've been doing the last two work sessions um where just kind of mention things that stand out um individually um to take into consideration F we bring back the recommendations um these chapters are relatively all short chapters except for um 86 which is the sign ordinance um and that has we included the old sign ordinance as well as the new newest draft that we have so I will pass the mic over to Mr CNA to take us through these last remaining chapters welcome sir thank you good evening so yes we will start with Chapter 70 concurrency management um a lot of these uh like how said are short so um I will just uh let everyone get started well I do have a a question before we get started you reviewed this thoroughly correct me yes oh yes okay um would you mind running through the recommendations that you're already suggested yes yeah my notes at this point are in the form of handwritten notes on the on the hard C of the book so all right so I've noted that Parks and Recreation that's an optional uh item for concurrency management no recommendation there but just to let you know that you're not required to have a a level of service standard for Parks and Recreation and the same with Transportation um and I know the uh Nellis county has uh done some work where they they moved away from uh Transportation concurrency into a Mobility management system so uh that's one of uh one of the recommendations that we're going to uh present uh relating to 70-7 proportionate fair share uh that's uh outdated language it doesn't conform to the County's recommendations for Mobility management uh and basically I'm not sure how how up you are on Transportation concurrent but uh it it's a Statewide system that does not work so well for built out counties and built out communities like pelis County um it basically says that if transportation's not there then a developer has to come in and widen roads usually um which is not so easy to do in pelis County not so easy to do in meler beach so um that's why um the county has gone away from that system basically it's an impact fee or it's like an impact fee when a development comes in and it trips a certain level certain threshold it has to be a major development so would not affect most things that you see here it would it would come into play if somebody does a major Redevelopment uh again it it probably wouldn't occur uh I say probably wouldn't occur but it could occur uh so we're recommending that you have it in there um and then uh certain studies would have to be done if it tripped a certain threshold and usually fees are paid uh as opposed to um widening roads or things like that a fee would go towards uh improving uh Mobility like p uh sidewalks bike paths uh bus stations things like that uh so we're going to recommend that uh the city move towards that system um and again like I said it wouldn't come into play that often because um if you're redeveloping you can subtract the existing trips and you're only looking at net increase in trips so this would only be like a major Redevelopment where they're going to significantly increase traffic which probably uh probably wouldn't occur it it would be a major development good example would be we reone and build up yeah if you're getting rid a single family putting up a higher rise if that scenario whatever happen then that would trip concurrency or that would trip the mobility management system and same thing with concurrency uh probably not you're probably not seeing uh developments that are tripping concurrency uh but that that's pretty much it uh as far as our comments on that we did go through and check Florida statute references and I think we're good there but that's a a the bulk of my comments on chapter 7 Mr reer did you have any comments on this section no not Council no okay please continue all right then um we can move to the next chapter I see which is uh 74 flood plane management um quite a bit more on this one and this uh like most communities it's it's based on a model ordinance and uh so we're we don't recommend uh major changes to that uh because uh you want to be consistent with the state requirements there are some options that you can uh make for changes to your regulations I think we discussed last time about um significant improvements and how often that those are tracked whether it's once every five years every year things like that but uh those that's a those are my comments on that you're limited on on what you can change or what you should change so I sent our current uh flood plane ordinance to the state um for their review it may take them a little bit but I we haven't had it done in a while so I want to make sure that we so your recommended change is no change uh my recommended change right now is to wait to hear back from the state I do have a I I may want to recommend not changing the definition of market uh value um just kind of what a lot of other communities in the flood plan management are doing but I want to get the consultation from the state first okay Council any comments on 74 back that was in our zoning we isn't that the it does refer back to it um but that section that we talked about we what department go to St uh the division of Emergency Management okay time scan I guess they're doing a lot with Brower County right now and I was trying to get commit to the end of summer um but might be a little bit lat oober 1 we don't we don't want looking at us while they're thinking about brow County not a good all right any other comments or suggestions or questions about section 7 uh said before please continue all right the next chapter was 78 uh a very short chapter one pager um entitled planning so um I think I only my only notes on this is we may want to uh combine that chapter move it to chapter 94 um just so it's all together does we're not sure not sure it necessarily needs to be its own chapter Mr SAR just a question attorney Mora um is it and I'm genuinely asking because I don't know is the existence of the LPA usually embedded here or is it typically found like in other sections where you see the various boards created for a community like the planning like the Planning and Zoning Board or the board of adjustment um just out of curiosity yeah it's typically under an Administration section uh with other boards and uh I think that's why I mentioned moving it to 94 I think that's where that section is and planning would could be grouped with those so we'll we'll we'll look as we as we start to synthesize these things we'll look to see where it fits F or where it's most natural it's it's a little unorthodox having a board embedded as its own chapter all you have to provide for an LPA but often it's done in the same breath as here are the boards we have we have our park and rec board our Planning and Zoning Board and our LPA so it may just be moving it and putting it somewhere where you're more more intuitive to find makes sense Council agreed all right continue on the chapter 82 all right 82 another very short chapter dealing with satellite antennas um not sure what the I don't have any notes on that I'm not sure what the experience is or or a concern is um a lot of times when this section is in the code it's outdated and dealing with the huge five foot satellite dishes but this one seems to be more up to date so I similarly had a question question having seen the code provision if you know as to where this chapter 94 addresses the kind of telecommunication tower that has been the of most attention the last few years um this is specific to satellite antennas I cannot profess that I have done any legal research on what the landscape is on our ability to regulate there except to say like Mr Sara I'm familiar with the outdated Provisions I I'm growing up I had a 10 or 12T black satellite in the backyard that we could you know maybe point and get a channel from somewhere else um but I I'm not sure if this continues to be an issue of concern in your community or or if the technology is is such that it's always prudent to have the regulation if you think it's an issue I just wasn't sure what you were if this if there was an issue in this community that needed address it yeah I read through this and uh it seemed perfectly reasonable just keep it out in front of your house and does council mind if I call [Music] on Mark V far as the old satellit go and the old antennas when it came to waterfront property they were to be located in the center mount to the house now there's still satellites available but uh that would depend that's uh Elon musk's system that requires the satellite to be mounted on the house so I don't know if we want to remove it but I would kind of hesitate based on uh just that information or somebody decides to put an antenna it designates Waterfront and interior props since you've been your di in any any position has there been rem or any permit requests I've never had the deal with this chapter but I think it's good to have that's there yeah the one thing I brought up to Mr Cera was and I saw an example in the B county code is the glare coming off of the new solar panels so there's actually a code that prohibits from the Sun hitting glaring into somebody's window right next door issues so I thought that might something looking does it make sense that we combine this with the antenna section yeah in my opinion anyway it might it might make sense to rather than having a short chapter to move it with 9 for with other zoning District regulations any other comments on this section yeah on Section D two the intenna shall be plac the Integrity of the side set back at all times and going back to what 94 we were talking about those setbacks are encro and this Trump uh we just got ruled by the county no that this is a different kind this is uh applicable to this kind of antenna satellite antenna not the Telecom telecommunications ant of what was what's separately regulated there so you're looking at this provision it's so no I would not read it that one but that may highlight for us again language that we would want to be mindful of again tempered still by the preemptions on amateur radio antenna and the authority I circulated following our last meeting saying your setbacks cannot be absolute when it comes to these kinds of those kinds of antenna Towers not as to satellites but as to the amateur radio well here's my issue is that ham ham radio operators have all these leadway um for of their hobby most of these antennas and satellites are the same thing it's at least at the very least is illegal fiction they are not the same thing right they're they're not talk about the device and talk about the usage right yeah it's for uh two-way Communications u in the ham radio their whole purpose of that is for National Security that's why they made special Provisions for radio if if uh EMP went off somewhere and suddenly everything's down they can still fire those up and get them go and that's why they they've gone to Great Links to make sure that uh we don't kill them watching the view is another story but the uh I I think the feedback is still well taken and as again as we look at these as we combine and harmonize them if there's Provisions that we can Inc as applicable to both we certainly consider that I I will say that um bringing up starlink bias things like that that is two-way communication and uh that's that's how I'm sure many people are now watching TV and they talking to people on their telephones and everything else that it's definitely something to take into consideration I don't think we're going to see a lot of that here but possible any other comments on this section are we making a provision for satellite two-way communication or that um I'd like to at least look into if someone got some new code to address the technology for everyone agree with that all right one that we've all waited for chapter 86 sign and I don't know if you want to jump to subdivisions and knock that [Music] out yeah we can do that all right so we're jumping to chapter 90 I think we'll spend more time on the he already had hisef no and on subdivisions um I guess my only comment on that is uh you may want to consider adding um provision for minor lot revisions and unities of title and lot splits uh that can be approved administratively um especially if they unify them and they want to come back in the future and then do away with the unity uh that they don't have to go back through the the subdivision process all over again not sure how often that occurs but uh I just noted that there was not U like a an administrative approval for small lot adjustments as far as I know is everybody clear on what he was referring to there when he talks about like Unity of title and division just I don't want to be patronizing but I want to make sure get lost so you're saying make it hard to join two properties but make it easy to SP them back hard D necessary I don't know about the first part about making it harder but just saying admin allowing for administrative approval if I own two lots next to each other and I say hey I own these two I want to make them one to be as I understood and Mr sh please correct me as I understood in either case making those administratively approved or did you just mean if you're undoing no correct correct make them both administrative now currently they may be just unifying unifying them through the property of ciser um some some places car about that some places don't um but I I would at least have a sign off administratively that the the town the city has a record that that was done and signs off on that and actually I think the property appr does require that uh an approval there is a sign off from the city so yeah but once they want to undo it um not requiring them to do go through a full subdivision process and planing and things like that who has ultimate Authority on signing off on this on the oh um on uh if it were to be administrative uh I I would talk that I would work at out with Kyle if he wanted to do it or doesn't make somebody to do that doesn't the County have to final say on this because it's it's in the tax if you're combined of two lots that goes right to the tax yeah and they they do have to get approval through the through the property appraiser uh there was a un title form that they have but it has a line on there uh you know check that it's been approved by the city where you're located but what I'm saying is if the city doesn't approve it and you can go to the county for VAR um it's a function there's an element of home rule involved here where in some communities if all it is is we don't really opine on this just go to the county let them know if if in some cities may be for example I have a if you have in your community a rule that says lots have to be at least 100 fet wide and 100 ft deep and you unify your title now you've got 190 Square ft in each Direction and now I want to break them up the city's going to say no because you're creating a non-conforming lot your lots are not both going to be 100 and 100 and so at that point you would need a variance but not at the county level you need a variance at the city level to create a non-conforming lot and most communities have a provision says you can't do that you can't get a variance for nonconforming Lots but it's an element of making sure you preserve the uniformity of your lot sizes and things that people don't get cute with you know land divisions and additions to Cobble something together that doesn't conform um and that's not that's a non-planners Exposition but from a lawyer standpoint you're you're trying to you know keep the aesthetic Harmony and logistical Harmony of what your Lots look like and what their sizes are so yes the county has to appr it for tax purposes but from a separate purpose you may have a local control element I think what Mr SAR is getting at is sometimes when you get these where where there is no non-conforming lot issue and there is no variance it's just hey I bought two lots they're already they're all the sizes you need they're right next to each other I want to build two of them I'm going to put a building right in the middle that's not going to be avoiding any setbacks making them go to a board whether it's your Planning and Zoning Board or your city commission it's sort of perun because you're asking them like hey can I have permission to do something that doesn't buy any any issues in your code I just need the city to sign off I think what Mr s is getting at there is why why put your board through that in that weird position where they might say no just because they don't like cut jib or something I don't know um but getting at what is otherwise administratively result ad what is otherwise a housekeeping matter administratively resolved what if it's three lots what if and again that's that's all all viable or all valid concerns and you can draw that line right a combination of no more than x Lots shall be approved in this manner I think is the sort of thing he's getting at is saying you guys get to define the policy he was just suggesting if it's creating any kind of undo administrative burden in the city or delay for that matter you may wish to streamline it some communities do I'm not advocating one way or the other I want to make sure I understand this so let's say somebody combines lots and they want to build a big house so if you're in the First Street and you have a bunch of smaller cones now you're going to have a giant there and that doesn't require any extra approval potentially yeah I mean that that is commonly done where they build a larger house and they build it in the middle of the lot now you can not that's one thing that um Kyle or whoever would check for if they decided to split it again you you couldn't split the house and zero line yeah you couldn't do that unless they you know but sometimes they do want to tear it down and and build two two houses again a good example would be a guy bought the anti lot next to him because he didn't want to neighbor and uh he has the option of merging those two together but he already has a house there he could just has big yard on one side years later he may want to pray F because he's getting ready to leave and once two months but he sells his house and sells Lots every yeah that one I understand the difference is if they build of a large home is it then out of character with the rest of the neighborhood well characters defined by Your Land Development regulations so if your Land Development regulations allow that a house shall not be any taller than x and no further than y from the setbacks and they do all those things then it's in character in that sense now I understand it's not in character in the sense that it's next to a bunch of 3 tws built in 1994 but you know split split house but that's sort of and that's what what we're kind of discussing you know what we live in an most of us so actually said what you just said up slap to so that's my that's my whole thing Aesthetics of what this whole Community is H SLS like gold girl you can fit the definition seen some homes some newer homes that have been buil just recently I guess they people would say finish four level has to be X still right I think they all around 12 14 most people are sting did the garage storage well the the 10 100 year I think the 500 years over 12 isn't there some kind of distinction between um like replatting versus unionizing two lots and oh whether or not it's a planted lot yeah cuz can't they can't they combine lots and actually replat first it's just unionized and then there's I didn't understand if you're talking to the property braer how much we could get involved with someone who's got a unionized lot two lots unioned and they want to you know break them back apart yeah they they do have a form similar where it requires sign off by the city um cuz yeah that's sort of what brought it to mind we had a recent example and the discussion was well do we have do they have to go back through the whole process and the process in that Community was you know very cumbersome and required planning board commission uh and then plating so and it was they were already plaed Lots at one time so um but yeah I think you could do you could set up a process where you could do an Administration leave it if they were pled at one time okay any more questions or comments on this section or chapter rather Mr oh yes sir just something to remember on splitting Lots or making two lots in the one lot You' got about three or four different things to think about one is the approaches that are in the curbs for the street and access to a driveway might have to be redone moving a street light might be another one or a coal and the other two things if you got two lots and go to one you're going to have two sord tabs and two water tabs I don't know what the county would require but we had that issue many years ago or a sewer tap wasn't closed and it flooded back sewage around the house so something to consider I didn't hear the last part of that you said sewer I didn't hear the last part what you were saying wasn't back flow it was an older house torn down okay and during the remodeling from the original to what was ever added on they had two sore tabs one side of the house was a new tap for the second floor and that house was tore down and you had an open Line it was never properly plugged just comments thank you Mr B any other questions or comments right back to where we were the sign ordinance right now we are up to chapter 86 I'm going to turn the floor over to you okay um so we're back to chapter 86 in the broadest sense I I will I look forward to hearing Mr s's input should he have any on on this um this is a to me this really comes down to a question of of process and and Community preference when I interviewed for this position almost exactly two years ago um at my interview one of the first topics that was mentioned substantively and and asked about competencies was about the ability to review and revise the city's sign Cod it was a stated priority and after we dealt with some high immediate priority issues upon my being hired one of the more substantive things we did was my my firm did was prepare and circulate the attached sign ordinance it was requested that we bring something to the council um and so um our firm has written sign codes uh for other communities in pelis and elsewhere and so we worked that template and adop adapted it as best we could to this community and said okay let's look at what your current code is what the landscape is and we provided a very admittedly very robust um sign code um before offering it I did confer with Kyle on it to say you know can you administer this do you have questions about it said it was comfortable you know once you understood its flow um and so we we put that forward my feeling is always that I am not a policy maker and you're Community you are the policy maker so I offered you here's the most robust approach and understandably in comparison to the previous draft or existing sign ordinance um the sentiment was this is a lot for a small community and a lot more than we presently have can we strip this down sure just tell me count um and so I I think we're kind of back in the same place if there's things that you feel are extraneous tell me uh we'll happily uh Revis in a global sense so it's consistent um I will tell you one of the challenges there two challenges here this this amendment is not just like hey let's make a sign code um in 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion that said sign regulations have to be treated as all other forms of First Amendment speech regulation and therefore have to be content neutral at the local level for time Memorial communities had different regulations for political signs versus um you know real estate signs versus other forms of speech and most especially political signs are the one that come to mind okay political signs can be out this long you can have this many the same isn't true for come run the 5K um and so that was how it used to be done and the Supreme Court said no you you can't have that kind of dichotomy it has to be content neutral and that was a plurality opinion which means that the Supreme Court did not have a clear 54 vote it was you know we all I we get five but it's three this way two that way and you kind of Cobble together uh what what amounts to a majority of opinion and so there's been some case laws since but the um the plurality was not it did not give an explicit and this is how you do it and so a lot of communities have adap have adapted in the format that you have here the last thing I'll say to that is what we've offered you is is an an attempt at anticipating every eventuality some of which may never become eventualities in your community um and so as you look at your community for example you do not have a commercial District in Beller Beach I'm keenly aware of that yet there's a lot of sign content in here about commercial signs well one of the challenges you do face is you operate as a jurisdiction a municipality in the State of Florida um just in the last 3 or four years the legislature preempted your ability to regulate homebased businesses to a large degree and so if you were a homebased business and we then have to get into a debate on is this a commercial sign is this a residential sign if Randy's going to operate his Law Firm out of his house and say you know come here to get your will done is that a commercial sign well it's commercial in content but it's on a residential property lawfully operating a homebased business this may give us a little bit of like well if it's this category we treat it this way if it's that and it takes out some of the guest room um but um again I say that to say I welcome your feedback I I want to be really clear I know sometimes when you have a product that you put before your client and and it's met with um you know some understood frustration or concern I am not I don't have my feelings are not tied up in this I just want to get you as my client what you want and and while I understand um at least this previous draft may not be what you want tell me what it is and I'll happily conform it to to what this this uh Community needs and Finds Its needs to be and that's what I'll say relative to the side okay I I have a couple questions before I go around and and ask for other comments or questions um your definition of overly robust tell me exactly what that means for the city well a few things I I think if and when I say for me overly robust or if you wanted to the an I'm I'm known in some of my other communities for analogies this is sort of a Cadillac Rolls-Royce of ordinances of here's every Bell and whistle we can throw in right so I know just on the face of it the number of where as clauset are intimidating and frustrating to legislators sometimes right like it's 30 pages of whereas Clauses but that's because we're operating in a in a somewhat fluid legal environment trying to say we knew the authority when we adopted this and giving you a rational basis to say and we harmonized it all in this dra um another thing is there's a list of prohibited signs you could just say here's the kinds of signs we allow anything not on this list is prohibited but then you start getting into well is this meet that definition or this so there's a long list of prohibited signs um and so there's different ways of doing that to be sure but that's the the attempt at exhaustively addressing each um possibility I think is where I get this being more overly robust and um I'm not wed to that language is just trying to come up with something that um conveys um that it is a longer ordinance and more substantive ordinance than I customarily put before you and uh your primary purpose was to in the event that a sign uh violation turned into litigation that we could prove that we did everything we could to try to prevent this from happening correct I mean I can't promise you the victory what I can promise you is I'm trying to put us on footing to have a a defensible position if challenged and Mr re you said that you would not have the problem inmin this policy goe no at first it was intimidating but as I read through it kind of pieced it in my mind of how to read it got easier and what about um code enforcement what how do you think that they're going to let's just say that we approve this um how do you think they'd be able to handle it yes um typically um code enforcement officer with the staff members bounce things off of me or asking [Music] a couple of at least two council members have made a recommendation of possibly uh preparing a simplified book because it seems like it would be a book to uh to try to uh Dum this down a little bit but you want to put up a sign here's your here's your guide uh is that is that even possible yeah we can do something similar to the uh the code enforcement brochure you do which is kind of simplifying all the language and putting all in place for the main things people want to know so I'm I'm heing you're actually pretty comfortable with with what we so far we've got okay um Mr Banker you've been very vocal about this uh sign ordinance proposed sign ordinance i' like to hear your thoughts well I talked to Kyle a couple weeks ago and I asked him uh how he bu about that he says he's comfortable and I'm thinking well he's comfortable he's got to be he's got to enforce it our great secretary for I wasw up with I mean it's it is so overwhelming I think it goes against Reed versus County Gilbert um I think it goes it's simple words of of uh Thomas and order I me as long as the sign ordinances are evenhanded there shouldn't be a problem I don't how many pages I stop J 25 I mean this is an even but we don't have a signed ordinance right now that we're enforcing for the last what four years what problems have occurred uh you know nothing that would be any different if we that's what I'm saying but we haven't had one in four years and we haven't had any issues so why would we burden our residents with something I don't and it would be a b if keep put it together like going with the wind I mean people's heads would be spin um last work session we were concerned about too many permits coming in reducing that point the 5year work back one my God somebody put a sign in their yard and whatever it has to be this B that you're selling this type of logic and only can be this big this is just ridiculous this is this is over this is government overreaching and I can't support I'm sorry Kyle I told you we don't do it I can't I can't impose this on our presidents council member Elliot well I I share the same concerns in terms of the administration of the ordinance um and I'm comforted by you saying that you feel like you could administer it so that's that's good but the other side of it is can our citizens understand it and one way of avoiding litigation is to have clear rules and so you never you never get to litigation and have to defend anything if if everything works smoothly and you end up with no problem um one thing I was wondering about and I understand I mean I certainly appreciate all the work that has gone into this and I understand the goal I'm wondering though um obviously I think you mentioned that uh municipalities throughout the state have been dealing with this very same issue and redrafting their ordinances can we see some samples perhaps of other ones that have a little bit more direct simplified language it's not the language that simplified the terms I can certainly uh research how other communities have have done this um in other parts of the state I can tell you when this when when Reed first came down there was there were two firms in the State of Florida that were willing to rewrite them for cities it sort of became a cottage you know um Service uh one of the attorneys at the one of those firms who was doing that passed away or became um very ill around 2017 18 their firm stopped doing it all together um and so our firm said well at least they've done a few we'll look at what they've done and we'll use that and adapt it towards our clients and that's what you have in front of you um which was which reflects what communities were doing at that time in response to read and I'm not suggesting this is the only way to write a sign code um we there are other approaches we can find them if that's the will of the commission or the council I'm happy to to look into that um we we can um we can do more in that regard um thus far it's mostly been a well we'll look at it we'll get back to you and so I'm not clear that that's what's what's desired I I know there are members of the council who have been vocal in that regard and and I respect that opinion I just want to make sure I'm I work for a consensus Direction um and so we can I can definitely provide more backing in that way I think we also have um Mr Sara here I don't know if he has additional um contexts he may be able to provide in that regard as well as he and I don't always work in the same communities or in the same regions so Mr Roberts so the changes that we currently see highlighted strike out text that type of change we were the ones who some of us here ones who work on within within the framework of the existing template those were the things where I said listen this is where it really is I want you to understand this number was a purely here's a number if you guys want to change it change it and that was the discussion when uh a prior comp position of the council though three of you at least were there um did discuss this and give some Direction that's how we got to the draft but again highlighting that 60 days for example is not some Supreme Court requirement um and so I wanted it I didn't want to mislead you in that regard when I say this is drafted for legal compliance and then you say well where does it say it has to be 12T and not 20 ft right it doesn't and I want to make sure that that those customizable elements are are quite literally highlighted for your review as the as the policy um Ry I want to put a sign in my yard that says Jesus saves me okay a big 4x8 is that free speech protected it's protected by the First Amendment but you can still have time place and manner restrictions and so if we say okay you can have that sign but it can only be you know 5 by seven you have the ability to regulate in that fashion and so we would say hey yeah you can put your Jesus's love or Jesus saves or you know let's go Brandon F Trump all the things that we've seen that have caused Great consternation in a lot of communities as long as they're consistent with those sorts of things but it is first amendment speech yes sir and I don't and I and this is no reflection on you if you submitted okay so take this personal not but you're regulating the size of one of a company or whatever okay and that's what I think it's the commercial versus non-commercial dichotomy that think you're that is and that actually is a very well recognized um principle both in re and in its prog in the cases since the Supreme Court has consistently held that the commercial versus non-commercial dichotomy is appropriate for um differing regulation and that to the extent that there's a dichotomy that's what you're seeing but my question posed I would think um because of the VAR the VAR the variables of different sizes of signs in this thing I think go right to the Supreme Court even though when I said Jesus I think the guy working down the End of the Street his name is Jesus but what I'm saying this is this is the way you can really get yourself jammed up in a community I mean uh I think we should just let this alone so the only what I would say just as a word of of of caution in that context is the existing code and its current form has language in it that we cannot enforce and in as much as it clud I I believe and I'm trying to remember because it's been a moment um if it has for example the political signs and Provisions which I believe it does it can only be out you know this size this number this whatever you you can't enforce that and what happens is then you get more to the point on your concern about citizens the citizen reads this and says hey the vote for Randy signs are all over the place they're too big they're arot do something about oh we can't do anything about it then why'd you keep it on the like why have a code if you can't enforce it that's ridiculous you knew that and you knew you know and then we run into that line and so we have to do something about it and maybe this isn't that thing but isn't our code right now for science isn't that held in advance we're not enforcing it it's we're we're not presently enforcing it because of that reason however that we I don't think it prudent as your legal advisor my advice would not be hold it in abatement and perpetuity it would be we recognize that it's an imperfect product at the moment and let's let's find a better product and again this may not be it but we need something um that I think better harmonizes it and I'm if the if the collective or even divided consensus given our current numbers is that you know I just I want to see more I want more information or I want other options or I want to see what can be done then let's do that that's fine I just my advice to you would not be to say play it as it lies and just or just keep your sign code in a bit because it also creates um false or unreasonable expectations on your city staff of the of the residents at large and we we have seen abuse cases in the past this this it's completely uh it steers the council in the wrong direction to say that we've never had a problem we've not had a problem lately but we have seen it and occasionally we do uh a guy unlic whatever mails assigned to a post and walks away uh they come along and they stick their their sign in the corner of somebody's empty lot and they walk away um even during the elections we saw that that it was just completely off the hook uh we I I believe that we do have to regulate signs otherwise we're leaving ourselves wide open for problems in the future it may not be a problem right now we're we're quiet and we're calm and and I appreciate that but it it may not always be that way especially with these homebased businesses uh if they start cing up and I I would tell you that to the extent other jurisdictions have done this where I've seen the council have the most um unst has usually been because when we talk about non-commercial temporary signage which is the sort of nomenclature for for anything from like coming for the Cure or vote for Randy signs the most challenge has often been the politicians looking at this saying okay we're going to limit people to five temporary signs and there's an election where we have three seats up the president and vote Yes on you know seven and all this stuff that that applies just as much as it's ry's birthday and we put signs out you know in the yard and stuff and so that's often where I've seen councils struggle extensively the other part is on how many prohibited signs do you want to enumerate or identify in in the ways of like snipe signs like I put a you know I I happen to find out that the lot next to Franks is empty and I put a little sign up that says take karate classes at my Dojo you know nobody's really monitoring that but I'm putting them in all the places that all throughout town because there's several places you can find it anywhere where like oh nobody's really monitoring so those sorts of things are where the the rubbers met the road in some communities or where there's been the most discussion ultimately I work at your pleasure my my recommendation at this stage would be if you want to see other product I'm committed to getting you not just this template but here are how you will see some uh uniformity I'm not going to say you'll find find things identical similar they not the same um and I'm happy to provide those and then see if there's you know um other communities that might be uh better suited for you and other communities that are not just communities my firm has drafted obviously you you'll get a more consistent product my my inquiry at this point would be at the risk of of setting a peer and colleague as if Mr Sara had any he wished to add at this from a plan perspective for what he's seen um advising other communities Mr SAR uh yeah we did not comment on the framework of that because uh we're going to defer to the attorneys um as far as it meeting the legal requirements uh we we know that there are new sections but we understand that those sections are probably required to meet um legal requirements and then the content issues uh we we just sort of focused on the uh types of signs I think um the attorney mentioned prohibited signs that's all new uh some you know that that's something you that's a section you might want to pay attention to then we also looked at the numbers as far as how many and how large just to look at the differences uh that's really what we wanted to uh we thought maybe you should focus on if you know if C if currently you're allowed a certain number and a certain size of signs what would this what would the impacts be of this uh proposed regulation as far as the way it's laid out in the length we did not provide comments on uh there are other examples that I'm sure uh the attorney could provide and we could provide um as communities um a little different because it doesn't have a large commercial section and that's usually where most of the sign uh regulations are are focused on so um definitely Ely uh could find some shorter examples but uh we we didn't want to comment on on how it's laid out or anything because of you know we do want to make sure it meets a legal requirements Mr Roberts youve not chimed in on this I think um what Kim requested will help if we can get some finished products that some cities in our area are currently using and if Kyle's comfortable with those I think we can probably take a look at those however many we get use parts from each one to come up with something that we think get fast keeping in mind that we are pretty much entirely a residential community so a lot of the sign inform that maybe in some of those other towns and cities are going to include commcial which we really don't have so we can hopefully simplify some of those that have been in existence working well you that's the biggest form of flattery we can find a sign ordinance that's been in place um not a very long time period because the May outdated respect to some of the changes that the state or federal government put place so think a good school to take a look at and develop our own what we have here right now may be very close to what we're looking for KY has said more than a couple times that he's comfortable with it and he thinks it can be um taken a look at by the officers that are keeping those so if P's comfortable with it and he's comfortable that we can enforce the sign that's important whenever I scoured through this I mean about half of his definitions um and I mean we have definitions in every chapter it's the very first thing that happens unfortunately whenever you're referring to signs um there are so many uh so many items that must be defined before you can even say now that you know what this is here's the rules for it um I think that it would be nice if there was a clear separation uh between residential and and business the problem is is that a lot of it would is replicated if you do that and so you would actually make it grow if you would split it in into two completely different sections um council member Elliot I would I would be interested in you looking through this after um after it's reviewed um after it goes through the initial review and let's see what the recommendations come back and once once we've got um recommendations made then maybe we take a second look and maybe you take a a deep dive into it because you have legal legal background what do you mean uh when it comes back for review you talk about some samples or yes yeah I I would appreciate that and M shiot and I actually began this dialogue when she was a member of the Planning and Zoning Board and and she and I have exchanged some of the the resources and materials that I was relying on and referencing in my Exposition and so I'm happy to work with you um more directly on this as we started on the pasta you know we've taken some some detours through form sixes and other things but happy to to revisit this and and work through continue to work through it to get a product this community can be happy with and I I think really if if we're going to try to take things away what uh what I would like to see is a u what we absolutely have to have um what may uh what we can keep just to make things more clearly defined and then what we think is just not rep city of and what I would ask of each of you as council members and I mean this in a one-on-one context is if you have whether anecdotally or just having reviewed the like hey I remember you know John's fishing spot back in 199 used to have a giant thing out here and you know whatever the thing is if there's something you know about your community I don't live here I and not and in a real sense I don't live here I don't see it day-to- day so if whether you're aware of a specific example or or just a concern you have of something hey when I was traveling and I was in new smina beach I saw this sort of thing and I definitely don't want that sort of thing here whatever the concern um no disrespect to new SM of be um um if you have particularized concerns one is my client but two of the policy makers who live here just let me know so I can factor that in by way of example when I was working on a similar draft which theyve not yet adopted in Indian Rocks Beach one of the concerns became hey will we have this property that's right off the bridge it's always had this will that be considered non-conforming do we need to give it any kind of special dispensation those sorts of things like I don't know what you know is considered the character in history and so I always welcome that input and I just want to make clear um to all four of you and anybody who should join your ranks when I'm making policy I'm doing it for you give me the input and I'm happy to to to evaluate it yeah and um just a you probably already know this but uh what actually kicked all of this off to begin with was that uh we had one gentleman who was hanging a 20 foot Banner uh on on the back of his balcony um and that was infuriating people and then you had another guy who uh who had a small political sign and his neighbor didn't like the candidate and so multiple phone calls were coming in this is before uh city manager rler took over but um we just didn't have a clearcut uh Direction on what to do in these cases and and by virtue of what I do and the associations I mean I'm familiar with some some of the more notable examples around the state of that and I plan to reach out to their City attorneys and see in light of what you know those experiences were postre read being the Supreme Court casee you know how have you what have you done anything with your code and see if we can get the benefit of of the controversy without having to go through it are you saying irbs will be to redo their Sig uh they yes they are or were as a result of re they have not yet adopted it they have a similar Draft before them um and they got sidetracked into an issue that of shortterm rentals that they felt that this was not an undertaking so it's also they're in a similar posture to you where it's come before their planning zoning board a couple times and they're commissioned once or twice in the previous composition they not ad do they're not actively it's not actively on an agenda it's on the action item list of policies if we can get past one other policy because they have a lot more but their their Community is different in character from yours yeah largely extremely yes sir their current their current sign ordinance is like 28 days I gu or something that understood understand but they're also going through a refresh they're they're evaluating all their policies as any Community should do regularly and this is we're talking about yes they're pretty much going through they they almost have well they have a very singular version of this is that right correct is that half now or half half now oh yeah okay so but what they have is something larger than this more what's been proposed to them is substantially similar to what's been proposed to you with distinctions for each of your communities and Kyle can attested and giving it to him I said you know if there are things that are specific to your community let us know you administer it we'll cut we'll we'll add it as appropriate we we try to tailor it but again when you're not on the ground in the trenches as as as it is at each day in the community you have to respect your your your client's input and that's what we're trying to do everyone concerned do you think that uh we can come back to this in the next month's wor SE and land through this I I'd conservatively like to say uh we can try for May it might be June just in based on the efforts of getting I know reaching out to other attorneys I usually don't get the feedback as properly as I'd like it and I do want to I do want to talk to some of my peers and colleagues to make sure I'm getting you the benefit of that knowledge so I would say perhaps better to commit to June and if hey if we're ready in May then that's great Council everyone good with that just a quick comment I wanted to make in my opinion it's not always is not always fair in something like this I think Kyle Hees a phone call and somebody's asking him about a specific type of sign they want to use what size it is they put it it's always nice that people look at the sign ordinance and say yes on page 14 this is exactly how hand as opposed to we don't really address that that's a problem and and and that's the balance we're we're running it's it's the the same is true in your personal life when you talk about insurance how much Ju Just in case resources do you wish to have so at some point you're over insured but you're never quite sure when that moment is until you know you realize it so um again I at the risk of beating a dead horse I I'm prepared to get you more information and some comparison and contrast work with member shot and see if we can't either come up with something different or explain why this is the best fit if it is what happens if Kyle says this is where it's located the guy has some gr assign knowledge and says well that's not what re Gilbert says well anybody can make a legal challenge C member I don't I would not I would not predicate policymaking based purely on the potential that somebody may make the legal challenge um only because that possibility always exists anytime you you regulate anytime you regulate anytime you regulate that's a possibility all right is that it any other questions are on this all right thank you very much for being here tonight and I look forward to your review and uh getting it back to the city attorney and I appreciate all your efforts thank you all right now we are up to item number two discussion of storm water study and I believe we have Larry fluty live you're here he's live I don't know why I see your name up there he's going to be present oh okay well that's funny cuz I thought I saw him and then I saw his name I thought he there but I I actually couldn't see him back there that's I'm right here alive and well thank you for being here tonight how are you great great good okay let's see te and I believe I have to share my screen yes okay well working on the uh St water uh pumps and uh I have uh here tonight some options for the Ninth Street location we have some options to look at and then or N9 me seven that's another location um starting off with the uh location on time we have uh four different options and what you see now option one is locating that in an area where there's an existing Inlet which is the last Inlet before it goes out excuse me Mr fluty is this uh C2 that was passed out are we looking at that on the scre top C2 all right thank you the U what I'll point out is one of the uh things to remember in this area on on Ninth Street is the all the other loc utilties that are located underground and uh underneath there we have existing gravity cemeter sewer we have County Water M uh we have the recla water M and uh we also have some overhead uh utilties which we kind of tried to show show everything there on the map so we have a an idea of what uh what we're running into what places we have to around so in this location uh it's it's within the red way uh it's going to be uh trying to make these on stations as less industrial looking as possible residential area where they're located and and function the uh in this location we're looking at you know we first looked at uh cast in place uh wet Wells the PS and then uh we got to look at Wet Wells for your sanitary liist stations they're pre-cast pre-cast stru so we start pre-cast is the way to go cost to keep cost and so this is a a uh prast wet well similar to what you see in the station and uh and there we would intercept the storm water and the type of pumps uh that we would use we talk to uh MWI pumps uh to manufacture uh uh storm pump systems and uh so we we worked with them given the flow rates and the elevations to work with and so they came up with uh pump size and the cost so we put put together the the equipment cost and then construction cost for that and then this option one and and getting the water out because you know water pulls up there and it doesn't have a way to get out that's why fix ping up project is uh we would intercept that uh at the last manle or the storm store before it goes out and discharge that to the creek that's just to the north North East so run in front of the property line would be about an 8 in discharge and that will draw the water down uh that would be ponding on the on the streets Mr fluty can can you uh can you explain to me what it is I I see pluming um I see a square I see a big black circle I see little white circles can you can you define those before we get any further so we know what we're looking at I'm glad you asked that cuz yes it is not [Music] the can you see that on as I'm putting that arrow on that I can yes what we have here is this location here you see this circle with the white in the middle yep okay that's the proposed wet well the p loation and what we're doing is these lines these triple lines that you see here that's the stormm water system that's carrying the water through the uh inlets to the man Hol and then it discharges through here and goes out to the se1 that's that's where all the the water collected is is being so what you see here is these Idols here that you see here be squares with the little be's in there those are storm water inlets okay and this darker dash line that you see kind of in the street here that's the underground gravity catary super so we have get an idea of where where that is and where it's going and it's kind of collecting there to three points St so it kind of collects there what we have shown here is kind of uh hard to see but this large dark line that you see yes and and goes around on the curve side well that's your pable water that's pelis County uh water water supply system and and forgive me but there's a another lighter dash line that kind of fit on the south side of the street comes along under the driveways under the driveways that is a reclaimed water H that's fourin recla and that comes down and it actually comes down to the front of the houses and it will go south to the next street and it goes north in front of the houses and that right away and it goes up and feeds the uh reclaim system this see and and then overhead you can't see it very well but it's uh it's telephone poles this is like there's right there where I had do that's a telephone pole and then there's one across the street right in front of this house that's a telephone call so the lock the power lines or strap how deep that forage were reclaim on I don't have a depth on it but typically it's about 40 in and that's just the county standard now we before we uh we have to get some we get some survey to make sure the actual it could be I thought it was I thought it was above 30 there's no FL L here right all right thank you very much I appreciate you doing that yeah no please and uh I think here on that so with that you know the location of the pump station and then what we have is dark line that's the discharge that would take it to the north to the creek and discharge it out there so the goal here on this one and on these options are to When the tide is up high the water is not getting out and it's ponging up this pump system will take it out to this ditch and it'll be at a higher level so it' be able to discharge and suck that water D to go there you said the uh the big round black circle that is the basically the well yes okay so in item option three can you tell me where that well [Applause] is okay way way up high okay I see see if you look at the north where it's going to the creek look at where the creek is okay you're going to see the black line and then a a dark Mass sorry for the prounce but that's the that's the rip WRA where it with discharging out but the location there if you can see the white D yeah it's kind of in the shadow that's what I could see it it's more towards the now the elevation higher and off three yes that's what iig what's the lowest elevation out of all where the well would be the lowest probably they're all very close but option one would be which side which size would the the well be 6t diameter okay so you're not making a su station not making a su Bas retention Bas at all you just okay right and option one would require an easement is that correct it's in the right away it's in the right way now yeah when we look at all these we try to keep everything in right away or publicly on lands because we are already have pling there now right so option option one's the cheapest way of doing it yeah I mean they're all very close but yeah so do you have a representation of what that whale would look like yes I do you see that it is that's the uh it's a circular uh well 6t diameter and the depth would vary based upon the depth of the existing gravity existing all right and what about height of out of the ground what are we looking at it's going to be ground level so it'll be pretty flat right and then what would be extending above the ground would be the control box that you see that there so those are usually about 4 to 5 ft you know stainless steel box but the top would be at ground level and U so I guess know example the 22nd Street catary L station yes it look a lot like that a lot like that okay could you repeat with 22nd Street c so you're saying that you mentioned there's a a creek there so the pump the pump is going to pump to that open cre and then gravity just takes that out from Greek yes okay so there's no alcol pipe or anything there just your gravity empties into there so if we have a very very high tide what happens there does that does that water actually back up on that GRE no I'm try pretty high so that water up come off all the way to the top l s to be blocking right for the pipe sake but right now it's just curious if we get a real L time back up oh currently in that sale yes it backs up into that protection I have not seen it that's good during aalia it was close so so what would be the max this Max side TI 3.4 ft so we went above that what I'm saying is what would that Creek's height be would that be 4T would that be 5T would 3.7t what do you have for the elevation right where the Swale is I think we're I think we Max high tide is the and that wouldn't be with a storm we get a storm surge and the wind's blowing this direction it's it's about elevation four at the SW to of what is it on the road huh what is it on the road right 13 mil dep Which Way wind going there at the creek it's 3.9 almost elevation that Creek is is there a pip at the end of the creek how does it exit the sea wall there's a there's a pipe coming from the retention Pond underneath the road out of theale the creek itself doesn't have a wall or anything right it's just a natural Creek it's just aage is and it does fill up so I I guess what we need to realize is is that uh first off you think that all of these options are pretty much equal maybe within an inch or two correct okay and as far as the exit strategy is there any advantage or disadvantage to picking one particular location for the conf station now the the you get the most Advantage by picking at the lowest Downstream point that you can but with the elevations that we're talking about it isn't really going to make that big of a difference between you pick it uh there where we showed option one or the street other options are going to be functioning about pretty close to same so it it really boils down to Aesthetics and cost yes and as far as the cost goes doesn't really look like there's a whole lot of difference no okay so more than likely the neighbors that are affected probably want to know what okay here here's the options pick one what do you think would you want this across the street from your house would you want it next to your house uh you're the one that's got to look at it but here's the benefits are you talking about I mean the wells bued so the only thing the only thing we're talking about for Aesthetics is the control lines right yeah drive down 22nd Street and it's this big thing sticking up and yeah uh but I'm thinking more like at sth Street where they have the sewer pump station go down there I mean you know our sewer pum station right right yeah I would say would be probably have the size of that yeah got up can panels be built around that can what panels be built around like decorative panels you you can yes the uh in the location here on 9th Street uh there there should be enough room to do that I appreciate all your time and um you weren't here when NWI was in but they said they actually have some neighborhoods where you don't see anything with the controll box and everything is very they did they talk to you about that or I didn't talk about very control box because I was concerned about what about maintenance at they said we have these 20 years well I can certainly talk to them about that about you know on the control mainly we're talking about controls of the pumps pumps and and the well itself is below grade uh and it's the control panel uh what I'm shown here is what's typically uh it can be in an underground vault as long as we keep the Vault dry yes we we can do that and uh because are you're talking about Thursday last when we got that storm that was still wet that area CU I had a meeting over here at 9:00 in the morning and that was still wet Still Water accumulated following day you know you know probably I was home oh I'm sorry we had like 2T of water my neighbor I don't think the people was what I'm saying would really be blown out of proportion having a control box there if it yeah you know what I'm saying you talking about an underground well I'm talking about anything you know like you said you could put strawberry around it you could put a wall de the wall if you got rid of the flood yeah yeah but what I'm saying here's the alternative you know got your house or exactly and obviously hiding the entire thing may be an option but I'm sure that drives cost of is that correct yes I mean we're talking not the cost of Defence and uh and material and and one of the things to think about even you know putting the control p on in in a under the ground would be making sure that it's water tight because it's going to be under water for a while sales break down things happen depending upon how many events you have increase maintenance I'm I'm going to I'm going to respond to Mr Beam right quick please go ahead you can if you don't mind if you don't mind um anybody that has a pump like that in front of a home would be real deterrent maintenance anytime night or day or whatever if it was going to be put in and I had any say about it I would move it into the city property on part and run the pipe over but before even doing that how do you plan on power this thing up when the power's out out here how it going work well the the power will be provided through and the same way as as the CET station have well they have they have emergency generators that bring out and plug in when they're not working the I haven't worked on the emergency on what to do when it's out but the uh idea for the situation in this location would be having a generator when the water does come up and over sitting out here you can't run them pum so you're going to have to have various devices on there to shut off when the water too much it makes no sense run we're we're aware of that another point at one time there a seaw wall planned along here so if that seaw wall was put in it would help the situation and then the Swale could be made larger to take more of the water that flows down behind night Street and behind the homes that are fed off off the Crossway Boulevard that would block a lot of the water to give you extra capacity how much capacity I don't know but this was discussion years ago they were even going to put a dig up the parking lot and put a swimming pool under that to collect some of the water and then dra them but the facts that you're going to lose power out of here have you thought about this Mr backer well exactly I I brought that up uping ppes here said diesel bag of generators would have to come in but um going with your tenure residency here I've heard about that um seaw wall to being installed back here and I've only been here 10 years and there's been nothing that I've seen planed when proceeding and I agree with 100% we need that would reduce an enormous amount of so so this is turning into giant project and right now I'd like for everyone just to focus on the pumping stations uh because I I do see benefits to having them but I also want everyone to understand that it's not going to prevent flooding it's going to do that's that's one of my points it's going to reduce the amount of flood time because as soon as the water gets above the seaw wall you're flooded there's no stopping it no pump's going to fix it it's only for that period between when the check valve is closed and the time that the water is below the top of the seaw wall so you've got this little time right here where it's a difference of four five 6 hours that you're underwater versus say 30 minutes damage is still done you're just it's less time and if you don't have power then you're not going to have anything either well the power is another story because we did discuss buying and uh it was uh yeah I know we talked about that when you were I on the council and for some reason that was taken out of the budget just just for a point of reference okay when it breaches the seaw wall from First Street down to 14th Street people have two to four ft of water already in the street right we had MWI pumps in there I gave him a bunch of mathematical calculations of gallons of street with and everything like that they ran them and they said yes when it breaches a seaw wall you will get water into the street but as day pointed out that's only for a short period of time there would be no water in the street prior to that so you already when the water comes over the seaw wall and you already have 4T of water in the street where's it going the house you're you're going to get water in the street but you're going to get it in the street not in your driveways and in your house there's also another advantage to doing this um is that see during high tide the check Val closes and then we get a torrential downpour that's really the one where we will receive the most benefit if we do this project is that's where it's problematic uh we cannot stop uh her title surge you can't stop is going to pick it your house is still going to receive damage yes you'll be able to get into your home quicker or get in your car quicker and leave or get home quicker uh but it's the it's the July 4 to 8 in in a single day where high tide happens to happen at the same time that's where it's going to fix that problem pointed out like last we before we had a my T and your checked out or whatever they Clos 2.8 ft so tide was up to 3.1 ft we had that storm that came in for an hour only dumped it only dumped about an inch and a half worth of rain and there was 2 ft of water in the street and stayed in that street for almost 2 and 1 half hours because it came in right when the tide was right around 3 ft tide went up to 3.1 and I I said to my wife I said to my neighbor when it hits 2.8 it'll start going out and it stay there until it hit 2.8 start draining down again my understanding is that with the gravity feed the water is going from the top of the street from VA all the way down and it's cooling there and it can't get out so what happens then is when more water comes there's a point where it's just going to start if I might take a step back I'm not sure I understand or whether we've walked through all of the four options maybe we can comment on those sure um CU I I I can comment from an aesthetic standpoint what I think about those but I'd like to hear from an engineering standpoint what are the attributes of each of these options okay I'll uh star with option one and uh this option is allows us to collect the water at the very last Inlet before it goes out so it's at the lowest point and so to get this out uh uh where it's ping up or it's not able to get out that's why we chose a discharge uh to the creep that's the 8 in discharge so it the water is rising there are check vals in there so it won't come back through that Creek back into the end of so it's just a oneway flow and this allows us then to collect the water on N9 Street and if then get that water and discharge it out to the tree the next option and is that the heavy line that goes from the the circle to the to the creek okay did you just say that you're going to deposit it in the creek where there's a check Val is that it's going to it's going to go to the north to the creek there's there's no check Val there there's no check valve there okay you know it seems to me that the Final Exit should be over the sea wall not through it because you're still low you're still you've got the same problem if it's if the water comes up too high I mean it go back into that as well I mean correct me if I'm wrong maybe the pressure is is strong enough to push it on out well the the the discharge line from that wet well to the creek to the north is a 8 in uh for think and so when it when water is flowing through that it can only go one way because there are check vals in the wet okay all right but he I think he's poting out what if it's not going well the check Val would supposedly stop it okay all right so you would effectively if you had a high event it wasn't over the seaw wall you would have enough pressure that it would still be blowing it out through that pipe yes okay okay I'm fine with that let me ask this while we're on this one um is there any difference between what's proposed versus we're going to be tearing up the street and resurfacing the street if it we projected out farther and into the street and not not through all of those driveways it's all about the the line discharge line yeah so take it uh out into the street is that an option it can be this seems like an easier more expensive yeah because now you're having to um you're having to contend with there's already a line right there running down the street and what is that line the heavy dash line is sanitary sewer okay and then there's a solid line on the uh west side of the street that's a water M and then there's a dash line that's running along in front of the HS on the east side right hand side that's the re if you could give us a key that would be helpful if you could give us a key or a legend yeah yeah that would be helpful and if you took it if you did it the middle of the street right now you're on proposing taking one inch you're Milling one inch off right now if you put this into the street you're going to have to go down at least a couple feet you're going to have to put in at least 6 in of modified in there plus the black top 3 in so that's it's much more expensive CU you got to get uh densities in the street for traffic so would be doing that anyway with building it through the not through you don't have to worry about asphalt you don't you're not tearing the whole street Mr how are you on time I'm I'm fine are you fine um Council I'd like to call a necessary 5 minute break um everyone do me a favor don't discuss this while we're at break all right all right back back to work again thank you Mr greatly appreciate so we discussing opportun okay I guess we're going through the uh the options and I think uh the question we had was kind of explain each of the options a little bit and run through them so you know the option one you know I said the last uh manhole putting the wet well for the proposed some water pump and there being at the downstream and to be able to be able to drain the water tap pump it out to the uh Creek to the north and uh there won't be any back flow through that because it's a a forc plan and uh so that uh won't have an effect of back flowing through the wet well back up into the street and option two is taking that same consa and take him at across the street and there the discharge again would be from that wet well to to decree and try to avoid as much conflix with the the water and the reclaimed water and U and it being a a force M it doesn't have to be U dictated by gravity uh flow so we can that would be line that be T the same depth as the water lines so think it's going to be a first and I'm I'm sorry could you repeat that again what what doesn't have to be fed by gravity the difference uh between the lines that we have on this draw you'll see the inlets that collected in the in the lines and it takes it all the way to the wet well of the pump station that's all gravity line so it's fed by water flowing through the C and what we would do at that location is put in a uh pump station for the pumps that would take that uh water and then it controlled uh it would then take that water pump out to the creek to the to the and this what will also be fed and have access because since it's all low this would be able to drain uh the water from the inlets across the street as well same concept cross the street and the pipe has to cross the streetly that's it is that the lowest point no the option one is the lowest point but we're only Within few inches of difference and at that point no matter where it is the well is going to be lower than the lowest point the entire area and that is a cheaper option than one it looks like which I'm really surpris it's my why is that cranking up number that's how it came out it's probably because it's it's right there on the street corner and and not hdden well and it's is going through the it is going through the street yeah it's not the okay option three is uh thought about you know the location of the WW f is what if we took it to the North put up against the creek and have a gravity line connected to the downstream M uh storm Manel so that that water can be softened out of that through the cul here and then pumped over into the creek and uh that uh we we VI here is that this uh storm line from that uh existing manole to the wet well would be about a 24 in uh reinforced concrete pipe so it be a concrete pipe drainage line and then that will go into the wet well and then that'll be pop up and over into the uh Creek and and uh and as the tide and the elevation goes up it it works just like the others back flow would not be back up into that pip would uh stay within that system as far as U strain on the top uh do you believe that there would be any difference not not any so just not enough not enough elevation change right okay now that's that's anywhere you know what well to go in practically any location that we can find uh a location for the cost of going to be within the same range that we have here just how do we get water to it so that's that's why you kind of see it kind of over top the existing storm water lines and then pumping it out in the creek to the north is the easiest or less expensive way uh of getting the discharge uh away from the street now seems to be the least invasive out of everything as far as AES Statics which one option yeah now what's four how does that different option four is on the other side of the street try to put it uh on the west side of the street uh it's similar to option two except it's just in a different location is that whose property is that that St s's property six I've been told that house was yeah that's probably the lowest property I think it is and that's why I asked that was the lowest it flooded looks to me like any of these are a good solution what what I do notice though is that you've got centralized collection points and I just wonder if there's any any chance for failure by getting farther away from the centralized area was that what you were thinking whenever you said best options okay you talking a longer gravity failure yes just in general something possibly plugging all of it up because it's a central one single point of failure so we were talking about the costing between option one and option two when I'm looking at the the cost breakdown for option two I just didn't see anything there that jumped out at me that was going to take into account the um cutting through the street asphalt or anything like that or the option yeah no I I did I didn't I didn't have a line item in there for asphalt replacement or things like that but I did did take that into account okay so so you feel comfortable that that cost whatever it might be is included in there I think maybe that's why it was showing that it was less expensive right than option one didn't allocate you're already going to PVE it you already had budgeted for that so all you're doing is trenching that pipe in there modify so if it's not in a line item where is it where is the cost the original no the cost break down in oh right there and on the um option four where it's showing the the triple lines going from the from the um collection area there in option four okay yeah is that because that's not what's the size of that line that's 8 in line it is but yeah from the wet well out that' be an 8 in line that' be a for but again yeah an option two it shows a thicker solid going from the the pump that that's my question why why does it show differently if we had the key there that would be representing something different yeah see what you're say fix solid line right well I I can give you the real reason okay my drafting ability on CAD I draw all right no problem so it should be it should be solid yeah line there going from the pH how about that young lady she better draw oh she's much better than I we were no problem coming up so that's that's kind of my not a problem now does this change no matter what option if we select an option option and say all right we want to move forward with this what does this do to the overall project does the rest of the project budget not change do we do we remain the same yeah okay all right okay so let me make sure I understand so we're already budgeted for repairing all the plumbing fixing the streets fixing the gutters finishing the Citywide storm water drain project this is above and beyond that okay but this is what we were all hoping for was that you don't have to change the project because those are necessary anyway so you you pick up a uh convenient location and you drop in your well and your pump and your control mechanism and power uh I think that's one thing that's not on here I don't see anything about power uh so do we have any budget any recommendations on that on the power I I'd rather talk with the Duke Energy okay first on that to get I can tell you what what we were figuring like 50,000 for the power but I don't know if that's for real want to get a real 50,000 on top of this is much less than your initial proposal where you were just we'll say guesstimating because you had really done into it to I I um I I don't have a problem doing this project at all um I don't I will vote for it can I ask a simple question we have a stor tax that we pay res how much do we pull in 7,000 75 and what is that percentage I should know all this percentage of the taxes that the residents pay because we're if we're pulling in 170,000 a year of course we going to use some of that money back to B of course but I want to see like from First Street to have these problems and if you could maybe just increase that a bit to 250 a year you know what I'm saying it's 31 so increas it another hours 3 30 every two months oh it is okay so you know what I'm saying or uh my city manager had another idea of how to fun it you explain fun how to fun what your plan was would just a budget amendment oh I mean as far as reserves we we have reserves we just have to rework um you know well if this works is what I'm saying I'd like to see the whole city eventually because you got big problems that first you know event you know you know what I'm saying I don't as MWI said let's see if this works you know we're digging up the street now this works in the future you know the other streets are those projects are completed on that in that area yes but while doing this this is a good uh as I was stating earlier I I really don't have a problem voting for this whichever option I'm actually going to ask you to speak to your neighbors and find out which option works best for the neighborhood because at the end of the day they're the ones who have to look at it and hear it and and the construction and and everything else but also there the ones that you're going to have to hear from whenever the Water Crest the sea wall okay because they're going to think that they're this is going to stop flooding and they need to all be aware that it's not going to stop flood it's going to help remove the flooding after it's happening well as well as prevent will prevent these rain situations when the when the tide is at its highest and they're happening with more frequency and more severity yes so this will likely prevent quite a few of them we get a big storm everybody's in trouble but but will this will likely prevent many many storms even even a big storm may reduce the risk because one resid got says there is a small window where Peaks okay so you can eliminate the water in the street before the peak okay then you accomplish I believe great T expain here and then you don't have that water sitting in the street for 6 to 8 hours over the let me ask this because the the repairs that are underway that is the normal project of repaving and then when find broken pip do some lining will that will that help n9th Street I the it will help get water to the inlets to the collection so it'll get it there more efficiently than it is now and the you know the pipes aren't uh scheduled to be replaced but I think what it will help is help get water to the collection points which is at the inance and and that's that's big help is getting it there and then the pump system then will get it out uh during the high water time so the help the recovery would be better because when when water gets up so hot there's only so much water you can keep uh pumping out but it will keep that intensity down so it'll recover a lot faster this one thing I'd like to for us to consider is that bringing the the street project back to n9th Street too while we consider all this good bids implemented assuming that we're going to move ahead is that it might still give some protection to N Street now as we're entering that big storm season um and also say that we're already like s months where the plan provided for ni we we moved it over while we were considering this but we mov ahead i' like for to move back tonight street so get those Protections in place and what what would uh the only way that that would be possible would be if you select an option that does not cross the street am I correct so if you pick an option where the tunnel goes through someone's yard the exit tunnel uh then you could theoretically move forward with n and go ahead and have the pavement and guttering and whatever else uh is in the plan uh but if you select an option where it crosses the street it's a big waste of money and time not I mean to to do it and then come back how uh Mr fluty how long do you think it will take to gear up and to obtain the equipment uh and then get Duke and do everything to install these pumps so essentially how how long will it take to install the web B pumps the I think a time frame on that I'm diing that putting that in I want to say 6 to8 months that's kind of what I figured that's lead time on the actual promps and all the hardware I'm conf what's that D not very quick either got three phas power they their engineering department you know they want plans drawn up they're going to approve that I hope that ansers your question you have to decide which which way and I don't think it does it a lot more does it add any more to the cost if you come back later okay provided you're not digging a free the street tunneling under the street corre from an engineering perspective which is the preferred option the preferred option would be from an engineering standpoint option one and that's the one acoss the street yeah it keeps everything on that side of the street don't have to be digging uper Street and and then they gets it out there's one more item to consider also is how Duke is going to run their power that may require digging up the street at that time that's going to be all up the can we tell where the power is on this there's a power pole a power right right there but is it high enough capacity closest place I know equipment there at Edge where I got that Arrow and uh now talk to the city manager you know talk to do make sure because we'll need three phas power there so my recommendation would be to wait um I know I know you want it now last last year three years ago um but um that would be until we know I mean you we may waste a whole lot of money because you pave it you gutter it and then they have to come in and tear something up to make this happen and that's the problem is we don't really have a good engineering plan uh for this project maybe it will appease your mind no disrespect the water that's coming in you're going to say it's going to get faster to the drains that with the before it's without pumps right but as again it'll get faster to the drains but once those drains are closed and they can't go out you're going to have the same effects as you did 5 years ago two years ago or whatever so and now you got now you got brand new asphall as the mayor said you know what are you really getting out of except waste or Poss was so you're not you're not losing anything by wai together once we don't have stor we do we do what are other people's thoughts in terms of when you're saying is the water is going to go faster to the drain and on nin Street if I remember correctly there's no pike changes on that street right no increased pipe so when not increasing the volume that's going to the drains so why are we saying that the water is going to get faster through the street gutter on the surface okay so it it can get there more efficiently permeable either because it's fresh asphalt I think that's a minimal thing just saying yeah that's that's not going to change much but it's going to be nicer the streets going to be nicer the gutters are going to be better all that the effects going to be the same what I think I think he said that you know um option one would probably be the best approach all the costs as the mayor already said are very very similar was just a matter of talking to the homeowners and see anybody for example an option one where you're going through their papers and all that those people aren't going to be thrilled sure well and the other item is are we going to consider the undergrounding of the controls those people may have objections if their pipes going out of their front yard control oh okay that I went to look at 22nd Street pipes uh just an electrical p Electric Power panel no PL prob a 3 in conduit maybe AIG stainless steel thing and that one's way bigger than what we're talking about it's for the full sewer system P you see some of the boxes on U golf bbard they're getting ready for the undergrounding screen yes be small should be smaller than that oh good well here I took photos so tell me what this would look like so I only took three but there were three different types of boxes there was a older green one a brand new green one and a stainless Ste you probably talk about something like it must you want to get this I said she's probably probably talking about box that size tall midle and how tall you think it it' be a thin pan off probably about about yay huh I mean it can be we can dictate the size I me the height on that but typically it's add a worker comes up so you know he going to open a p so there's just those types of oan oh so it could cuz these are low yeah oh all this is an access box maintenance and the goal is to just keep it higher than the water will ever rise that's because if you do you do a one that's underground you there is a m issue over time things do we out just like your condition unit has to be up so high okay it probably be about the same as your air condition so how about the Seventh Street estimate that's we going to do that as well sth Street this is only night tonight yeah but he got over here Street what do they all see seven street is on here Street more I only see one option that's yeah seven street is wet well in the in the Park area so and then the discharge out it can that can be you know the same as the others of for name it can be higher and that that project relatively simple because there's only one option that's it and cost that's the highest close to the same price so we didn't get a nice drawing on that one but I guess it's not necessary we like pies yes we do there is a seven Street drawing called seven Street details I again they're all Clos in price but why is seven Street a little bit more what's more complex there the numbers you got a street already we're working off the street has a it's going to be opened up you're going you're getting your street redone already street is already so this new this uh this pipe going to the well is a brand new pipe from the street is that correct yeah okay well that makes sense that's a it looks like a long run too and it's going underneath the driveway these the three lines next to the well um that's an existing storm District storm what storm water discharge that's the uh big line that's the county line okay all right it's nothing for us right I like location questions comments okay well I think we've run out of questions it's just a matter of U you guys girls um going and speaking with your neighbors and finding out what really what would like to do if I could ask attorney MOA how can we do that is there any way that we can do that together no we have to do it separately very simple answer no do not do it together or have a public meeting well we can have a public meeting the challenge that you face with the public meeting is the public is not compelled to engage in your meeting um and whereas um if you're in friend L conversation with other residents and and property owners in the community you're free to speak with them individually uh you and any other member of the council cannot do so jointly um or or um you or and you also cannot uh use um third parties to do what you could not do directly so you could not say to please let me know what you think I hear that you're going to have a conversation with with council member MOA when you meet with council member MOA come back and tell me what he says can't do that either I'm not suggesting you would but just to to define the Contours of that but you are free at any time to get the feedback of your constituents Property Owners anybody else who you are interested in discussing policy issues with as long as you're not doing so in the presence um or indirectly with your fellow council members and what about uh city manager reer no problem there right there is no issue with you individually meeting with the man manager reer or by way of example on the sign code meeting with me directly on an issue um but again I would not meet with two of you at any given time on a policy issue or serve as an intervenor I mean I I see one two three four maybe five homes impacted by this and I mean that's it that's that's the only people that really would need to uh be asked about it yeah if it's option one only two and Street one guy the P gu going to have the box so when the pump is running my noise perspective would any of the homeowners possibly be concerned about that should but I can verify that with the pump manufacturers the deci of the sound what they would he well and interest related to that would be when it's not working is there any sound no when the pump's not running there's nothing that you hear a hum from power or anything like that no okay cuz if it's running we'll all be thankful that it's doing so I have a feeling you won't hear it at all because it'll be underwater most like okay um any other questions or comments about this before Mr fluty goes home and has a nice ear thank being great I appreciate you coming tonight and uh this is a great presentation thank you for answering all of our questions thank you for showing him how to use his computer and you don't know how much I'd say thank you all right well now we are on to General business have anything that I apologize can I ask one more question no you're all out of questions go I'm sorry can you give an example of another community that has implemented a similar pump and what their experience has been sure AC I don't know if they used that wi but they they put pumps in their system and they were flooding they had now they got dry I say dry streets they got W streets using he he gave us that I forget the community he he showed us from m i thinkr too list thank okay uh any anything else council member thank you sorry about that thank you Mr FL thank you uh okay General business uh does anyone have anything that they would like to discuss I I have one topic that I would like to bring up but opportunity first just any update on the um candidates toed potentially to the you should bring that up because that was what I was going to discuss um as far as the three candidates go um I'm really I'm struggling with collecting people and the reason why is because I look out into the audience and I would think that at least one would be right now trying to get used to what we do and learn about City jce and whenever I look back I have to ask the question how many have ever participated in anything that they did see um now I I will admit that we do have a city council member that um I pry much trct to because I knew that she would be a good candidate a good a good fit at least I hope that she will uh and and that that worked out well but um I look at this Council and I see that we're actually we're working out well we're getting the job done and I'm just wondering if really there's an immediate need to fill any more sense um can anybody at this point in time so let's say somebody else was interested we had a special we are not we're not open for applications at this time and and so the reason why I bring up the appoes um right now we have three actual elected Municipal officials on our Council that they actually knocked on doors they got to know the uh Community they actually came in and set in on meetings they um followed what was going on they were very active and at the will of the people they were elected if we had one two or three more those are people that that the citizens did not select again I don't see any of them here tonight if I might add one thing about that I think to and his father I'm sorry to hear that um going back though prior to suddenly having an interest and and I I suspect that maybe were drafting him um actually no said he attended some meetings before that he did and and he told me that he had um um I've mentioned that I had been in favor of the bond issue and spoken to that and spoken to the fact that let's look at this evaluating from the project and he says yeah I know I was there so he attended that one also um so he's been involved so there's been a few that he's he's actually attended yeah and and the three uh candidates have any of them serve on anything for the city any of our committees or boards or any of that um there all three great people no no I'm not challenging their personalities or anything like that I'm just um what I'm trying to do is is I'm just asking the question are we doing the right thing um I really have a problem with three people walking at that okay let's say maybe we have not really done anything had no prior exposure or interaction with City business or even paid attention to it until now um and is that really what the people that voted for us would want us to do uh and so that that's that's uh what I'm going to leave you guys and you with uh that like Council to to leave this meeting and put some deep thought into what's the correct action for the council um I I definitely have a major struggle with taking three people and just filling three seats as now we've got four unelected and three elects well right now we can't fill three because the Char amendments all yes sir so now Char that is the only one that had a different effective dat than we do not have to fill all seven we do we don't even have to fill the fifth um we we can continue down the road that we're on right now which is actually working out pretty well or we can add another and maybe that'll work out well also but I think that um I think be a mistake to fill all seven seats with a majority it's non elected and I've had some citizens talk to me about that more than one or two go the same way but here is a question so let's say let's say we don't pursue any other the three just as an assumption if we had somebody that checked all the boxes that just approached any of us and said you know what I'm interested in doing this what mechanism to be have to put into place to open up a window for people to fill out applications it requires us to um designate an open and close in time to AC applications okay we don't really have to do that do we I mean Council has so not not necessar you're correct that you don't necessarily have to do that um you have the discretion to accept candidates at any time thus far we've been um establishing periods qualifying periods but we can solicit on an open basis in state by you know anything received by the state will be considered there's nothing in the in the charter code that specifically requires us to to repeatedly reopen narrowly defined time periods someone some of us on Council these resumes say there's anything wrong with you know exploring the GU background but she here could disrespect she we could put him on we could he said no way too I think but we could put him on you know during the council meeting is what I'm saying you know but we would have to Randy we would have to say we're opening it up to some period not necessarily what I what I was suggesting is You may wish to have a date certain that you're like if you're see if you're soliciting applications and written materials it's helpful to have a deadline for people to timely submit those um but there's nothing that specifically says uh we have to you have to open it for 7 days not to exceed the this day and that like it it's it's not that strict you folks you for are defining the process and and however you wish to control how you appoint people um you know I would the lawyer in me me Banker has the caution of course you could app um appoint somebody provided there and we can we can certify that they're a qualified elector and otherwise um but you know and that's why we require the materials is so your clerk as your supervisor of elections can authenticate that they are in fact a resident they are in fact a registered voter and otherwise qualified to serve but beyond getting the information necessary to establish that they're a qualified candidate and and I mean qualified like Base legal qualifications at that point it's your process now I will also say just so that you know that I greatly appreciate you being on this Council and you're working out awesome you're asking all the right questions you also saved the day because we did not have anyone and we business would have stopped and so uh I applaud you for answering that call and I'm truly grateful that you're here every time we have a meeting you are uh you definitely add a lot of value to this coun what about me D didn't I say just threw up I was just flattered you wanted to spend more time with Me Frank now now you just left it out to the public that's the only re St okay so um do we want to have more conversation or do we just want to add it to the um to the the next council meeting and see where the ships fall because you're the chair what do you want to do I I would like to wait I would like to wait on bringing in another Council if I can take 30 seconds just add add some thoughts and one is um thank you for for your comments as well as the fact that recognizing that we're doing well this is good it feels really good be collaborative so that's um I did want to since you mentioned recruiting I just want to clarify that point because um when we first had our staling and we realized the importance of the for member form as well as a for member and therefore unanimous vote um I had issued a letter to the citizens through the email system and I you guys and and emphasize the import that we people think that's that point so that's when Anders responded so he came forward on his own it may been in response to that letter May because he already thinking about it I don't know but but anyway so secondly as we think about ties obviously that's um so having one more or another would help ties um but also as we consider the form um I think all of us have busy lives things are going on we're all committed to being here and being present at me twice a month but there is a lot of planning around things and things do happen um what might be helpful for the for if we either have more clarity or maybe some loosening in terms of physical presence so what can be done and can an ordinance be changed or is this a charter issue or can something be um liberalize uh the physical presence and and have more flexibility without virtual presence and it can even be you know no more than once a year here no more than you know so many we have we have unlimited now right for individual members we have unlimited to the extent of is my recollection as well um though I'd want to I'm always going to give you the copy but I want to check what it's in writing um that's my recollection as well member Banker um the physical presence requirement is one for the physical Quorum so one member can be absent or it depending on your in your current composition one of you can be appearing remotely so you can't go out of town the same time Frank's trying to go to Philly and then us have a meeting right for example and that doesn't come from the city's ordinances candidly I don't think it comes from any law I can show you in writing because the what the Sunshine Law requires is that we have an open and public meeting and the way that the Attorney General's office has opined and articulated that that should be in forc is requires a physical quum and there is some um law review articles out there saying but where is this it's being read into it but it's not explicitly there it's been read into it in the sense that then the public can't see what are the offscreen elements and this especially in the yester year of conference calls we can't see what other things you're looking at and what you're doing and who you're talking to off mic or whatever else and so the in the interest of the article one section 24 interest of everything happening out in the public that's where that comes from um but I again there is some division of opinion on that what happened in Co is it really came to drive the message home that this is everybody agrees we're B we're Bound by this because every Community was relying on executive orders from the governor to wave that requirement and as City Town Village and attorneys and County attorneys we were saying hey I wouldn't advise you have one unless we've got the executive order still in place that's waving this physical quum requirement but when you go to chapter 286 you will not see it written there it is the way that the state has and not even necessarily the courts but the state has opted to enforce and interpret it and then as the lowest on the totem pole we say well if that's how they're interpreting it I'm not going to be the one who says let's try it without and take the challenge um but I will tell you I think even one of my colleagues wrote a law review article on this in the early 2000s saying this isn't really there and in modern media it shouldn't necessarily be a requirement but it's preserved as part of the spirit of the Sunshine Law in making all of the Affairs of the Council um transparent invisible to the public so that's where that physical Quorum comes from that's not from your Charter that's not from your code that's from chapter 286 Sunshine Law as administrator that's help yeah and as as it as it stands right now whether you're online or if you're one of us is just not here we still have a forum and we're in good shape if two of us are out I don't know if I would actually I'm just not sure how I feel about it you know we we've postponed meetings before because we didn't have a quum and we survived okay we couldn't meet this day we'll meet next Monday um and we we've adapted pretty well and I don't really see a big issue I don't think what is our right now three it's always been a majority of the council these things got conflated but it's always been a majority of the council so for every moment that you've been for a quorum has been three the question was what does it take for you to do official acts because if three of us gather but we can't vote on anything or do anything why are we Gathering was sort of the the division right right so and and the word Quorum is just what what is required to gather lawfully but then there's a high you have this heighten requirement now it is you only need a majority of the council to take official acts not four so now if three of you have a meeting you can meet and you can take official acts that's what's changed is the ability to take official Act because of the charter and and when I got on counil and they got involved with ly Kyle because our sound system is deplorable if you did it by phone you couldn't hear nothing I'm it was it was I don't think should back no it was terrible he he attacked it and now I think it's just you might have maybe a two second delay but it's Crystal Clear you okay and and I will caution all of you that the only the only hesitation I'll have for you folks appearing remotely is if we're having a quasi judicial hearing and there's a concern that you will not be able to receive the evidence presented if you're saying I want up here by phone while they're going to be putting on maps and displays for a variance hearing or something that came before you that would be the only place where I as your City attorney say I have a little concern about so and so appearing remotely most everything you've done has been legislative and the way your boards work you don't get too much very too many um uh quasi judicial matters before you but I do owe it to you to tell you that if we found ourselves in that posture that might be the one place for I'm like I don't love that so I'm going back to what I was uh originally asking was uh can we put this off for a little while and see how it's working with the council and if we uh decide that maybe it's problematic to not have five then we open the uh application process back up take a few applications and see who's best thought have we heard anything from the three candidates that F an application they call the city at all they're still in differ okay da I'll say this like I told the other mayor I want to work with you if I have objections I'm not going to vote okay don't have a problem with an objection that's it's your priority and that's my Independence I of course I I want to work with you the chairman the mayor of the city Andel is mayor of the city I want to work with him I told him I told him the same things is you don't agree with something please don't vote for it but give be a debate stay true to yourself and stay true to your core that's that's all I ask of so if you want to delay it I don't have a problem everyone else okay with that with the understanding that if um we could still bring any or all of the other three candidates back if we wanted to to vote uh someone would have to uh put it on the agenda and a motion have to pass and the candidates would have to still be interested at whatever that later date was be other candidates or and there may be others as well correct yeah that I mean if if they decide if someone decides that we want to uh open that back up uh then I all I would ask for is that we open the entire city up to for people to apply because I want whatever whoever it is we do this that I want the very best candidate we can get because remember we are electing this person not the citizens and that's why I just don't feel very good about it okay any other General business otherwise I will ask for a motion will those um could you out there you go all right uh I have a motion to adjourn do I have a second second all right all in favor all right I go than"
