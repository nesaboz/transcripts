going to speak tonight actually stand up and be sworn in by our city clerk would you raise right hand we're about to please in these proceedings is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i do thank you mr kelly i'm sorry i forgot to recognize uh the city engineer al carrier okay that he's president when i asked for the staff report i was going to do so but yeah we are glad to have al carrier from dual associates here on behalf of the city as our siblings thank you okay i'm actually going to go ahead and follow the rules of procedure even though we have them on our agenda for those who are in the audience this is how we're going to handle this meeting tonight i will actually read the variance request first al on behalf of the city will be the staff report the applicant will then actually make a statement at the podium we'll have open discussion regarding the variance request we will go ahead at that point and go and vote on the six criteria questions that are in your packet and then at the end of that we will have a motion and a second for approval or denial in the form of a role called vote so at this point even though we're down one member we'll go ahead and ask to write the period i'll read the variance request and tell me at that point you can give your statement this is consideration of various requests two eight 22-01-2228 drive anthony kevin gatlin peggy and gadlif are requesting a variance from section 10-172 regarding setbacks height and width for swimming pools subsection g that reads the height of a swimming pool should be no higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road any structural part of any permanently installed in-ground pool or spa should not be built higher than 24 inches above the pool deck including race spas raised pool beams upper level decks that raise waterfalls auxiliary deck mounted equipment such as handrails ladders grab rails diving boards and slides shall not be subject to the height restrictions set forth in this section this variance is to install a pool and spa 14 inches above the maximum height allowed by coat thank you okay okay so i have some prepared comments i'm going to read verbatim to public speaking i decided to write down my thoughts and here we are so the variance of we're asking for is a minimum difference between our patio and the 18 inches currently allowed by code that difference is only 14 inches brief history of our home our home was built in 72. other than the roof and ac there were no changes to the land prior to our ownership purchased the land in home in 2016. at that time we had to replace an aging seawall looking ahead we had a pools man built into the new seawall we renovated the portion of the home in 2007 adding some square footage we kept the grade the same we didn't raise it and our grade has remained at this present level central home was originally built we have two adjoining neighbors one who are south and one to the north the home to the south has a pool deck that is approximately two feet higher than our proposed pool deck the home to the north has a pool deck that is approximately six inches to a foot higher than our proposal both of these were constructed prior to the current coordinates of providing some photos for you you can kind of visualize and see what they look like our proposed pool deck will not create any flood danger to our neighbors as their homes are higher in elevation our adjoining neighbors have reviewed our plans and have no objections letters from both are presented for your review and that's also attached there looking around the neighborhood there are numerous old homes with pools that come directly off their patio parade many at a similar elevation to our home our older home like others presents a unique circumstance for coming directly off of the patio grade just makes common sense we feel that we're being unfairly affected by provision in our city's code that was poorly conceived it punishes older homes that were built at a reasonable elevation again take a look at the photos of the home in relation to our neighbors allowing the 14-inch minimum variants who pose no danger to either of our neighbors it will make possible the most reasonable use of the land and our home and to have a safe pool a minimum of 14 inches that's all we're asking anyone are there any um letters at all as mr gatlin just mentioned from anybody that you've received regarding this variance no i did not receive any okay in tony's packet that he just read from there are letters if you'd like me to give you these from both papers mr gatlin gave me a copy okay all right so the neighbors to the north or the neighbors of the south have sent letters of of um approval for those variants is that correcting that is that as well okay are there any questions for chris arnold's who's here from kelly pools tonight on the board now any questions whatsoever no questions okay and at this point i'll ask you out a civil engineer to go ahead and read your letters on behalf of the city good evening i'm l carrier with dual associates we're an engineer record for the city we provide multiple services for the city and i have been sorted we are asked to provide review services for the request for the construction pool at 2 2 2 8 um based on the review of the plans prepared by james hines pe 33678 plans dated 12 31 20. we had to deny the plans because of inheritance to the city code city code is in division two under swimming pools section 10-174 subset g um subset g the height of the swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 inches above than the crown of the road the crown chrono road on the plan set was stated at elevation 5.3 and the request is to put the pool deck at elevation 7.8 thank you at this point i'm going to go ahead and read into the minutes requirement that tony and i have both had to fill out forms because we both have voting conflicts for this case tonight um it is a absolute necessity that patty sent copies of all of these two forms to each of the board members in advance of this meeting and it's in its requirement that anybody that has a conflict of interest cannot vote but must abstain from the vote so this form which is from the state of florida ethics commission is acknowledging anthony kevin gadliff and michael edward kelly are both abstaining from the vote tonight as required and we're reading this form into the record and it will stay part of the record with the city to stay saying that we understand the law and we will not we will not vote at this point we're going to move forward into the section that is our criteria of six questions that the applicant must receive a yes vote the yes vote from the six the variance will be approved by any no votes of any of the six the variances denied if you want to use the worksheets we each of us have the experience request worksheets carol you got yours yes okay tell me yes do you want to copy this okay i'll read each of the six and each of the board members will vote in a roll call fashion that patty will call mark can you hear us okay yes i can thank you okay okay the board of adjustments

ms conrie aye mr elliot aye mr gatliff i'm state miss goldman aye mr kelly i abstain okay by both of four zero and two extent abstentions variance request 22-0 is approved [Music] that's all we have on the formal agenda for this variance request but if there's any open discussion that we would care to discuss or items to discuss [Music] now would be the time don't you have any comments now that this has already passed no well glad this is glad to see it behind us ready to move forward al i think we'd like to give you a little back a little bit of history here on this ordinance if we can because there's been general discussion with the city manager and with staff and some elected officials that this ordinance should be reviewed or possible change so we'd like to do a little discussion if we could tony as the applicant has had to deal with this myself as owner of kelly pools and chris from kennedy pools can give you a little bit of information and we think it would help because as this moves forward the the city council could put this in the form of a workshop couldn't make that yes sir isn't that the procedure yes sir we'll tell you how this ordinance came about and what happened prior to 2014 when it passed and see if you as our civil engineer would ultimately give us some opinions there's some help related to this ordinance chris you want to come up and say anything about that you want me to explain it you know sure when this was originally proposed there was a lot of from my understanding because obviously i'm not a president of the city but a lot of the newer homes that were being built very high up above playing flip lane they going to go the pools of that higher level so a lot of these pools were being constructed were repeating views from the neighbors next door and creating water issues with the drainage and the neighbor's property so back then what was involved with the city and rewriting that ordinance they arbitrarily chose 18 inches i don't know where that came from but that really is a hindrance on a lot of the warehouses like wishing us because it would be impossible to above the crown of go road because that pool would be below grade in a lot of instances so there's really been nobody overseeing that through the years so the contractors have kind of been putting on the forms what they need to put on there and it's never really been checked either prior to construction or after construction so there's probably a lot more of these coming forward in the future you know unless it's addressed by the council and city manager um there's houses even adjacent to tony's home where new houses are under construction now that are a lot higher than his houses for your base elevation well we'll call the great the floor level house okay so don't you think each of those pools that are coming forward would need to come before our boarding adjustment or the variance needs to be reviewed by council which could happen for a change i will tell you because i was directly involved in 2014 when the mayor at that time who was a general contractor and a well-respected man in construction had heard from various people that when some of these houses that were built at grade four or five feet above [Music] that neighbor's grade the neighbors ended up seeing the back of a retaining wall that was excessive and enough action took place to where the mayor instructed staff and an ordinance a change to this ordinance took place in september of 2014. i was president at the podium at the time the civil engineer for the city was present at the time we both had disagreed with the 18 inches above grade we wanted 24 or even 36 for reasonability um we the compromise took place in 18 inches was written into that ordinance that's the history behind it the fallout of it is now what's happened here fred your house is even three feet above the crown of the road um [Music] we're saying to the city what happens next what would you and would you on behalf of the city prefer to go out when the applications come to come into the city for various would would you want someone from dual associates to go out and shoot grades out there to confirm yes or no on the applications what do you think this is just general discussion well generally i think from a plane release standpoint um well let me back up we talked earlier about the 24 inches apartment for the finished floor of the house above the crown of the road correct there seems to be some sort of disconnect at least from the designer standpoint that you know or the pool can't be higher than 18 inches from the crown of the road so if the house comes in and says 30 inches over the crown of the road pulls decks down to 18 inches you got four steps to walk out the back here most people don't want that most people want to have one continuous living area [Music] in doing that though raising the entire house and pool area one of my major concerns is looking at the drainage so what happens you know people just shed the water off the pool decks and a lot of times if you have an older home that's adjacent it usually takes the brunt of you know the runoff because when people buy uh buy a piece of property to redevelop they're going to raise the seawall they're going to raise they want to get the house up as high as they can with the pool deck and then a lot of times um spen and i don't see provision in your code that requires that a drainage plan be provided at the time that the seawall is constructed and or pool's constructed so i think that might be something else that needs to be addressed in your code in your code when you address the height of the pool deck provide a some sort of drainage analysis to show that the water after you're done construction goes over the seawall if that's where it went originally or a lot of times interior lots where there's not a sea wall um there's a that's a b-type period where the water comes back to the stream and that you're not affecting the adjacent properties some of the other reasons municipalities do have that in their their codes familiar with treasure island he's been a consultant for treasure island for years you and i have been to meetings at the city of treasure island regarding the elevations of pools because adjoining neighbors like he just mentioned are coming to the city and saying this brand new house going next door to me is going to flood us out and the meetings we've had were with seawall contractors civil engineers and pool contractors this is a major issue up and down of dublin not just our city tony's a victim of this ordinance quite honestly and in the city according to lynn reeves when we met out in cities out at tony's house with chris and myself we asked them who checks it on behalf of the city free pre-application approval and lynn said nobody going by what you said even your letter said based on the plan from kelly pools this is in this this is a violation so our next step moving forward is to go to work session if mr gatlin and or others care to to ask the city council to change the ordinance a revision would be necessary and your advice will be imperative because there's got to be a compromise but just like you said if we're 24 inches above the crown of the road to your garage floor six inches give or take higher another until you're up 30 into the the main floor you're on the ground two tonight right there we did have patty i'm not sure you would know this and kyle's not here to to say yes or no we did have for years out of maximum height on a retaining wall about around a swimming pool around the deck four feet no higher in the city at 48 inches there's retaining walls all over the city that are no higher than four feet because that during the time that these elves did the ordinance was written with this not the 18 inch maximum but bill poole's built a grain that's how we solve the drainage issues so i mean do you have one around your pool is there a wall behind your house this one right here was in there retaining wall my old falling article when you build the new seawall it's usually 18 inches or two feet higher than the original sequence right right so when you do that it changes your whole back gray well don't you think what we're talking about is modernizing this whole approach yeah because everything has changed and even the greater the street has changed well why was that why they had they had a big uh they went over all the ordinances like five years ago right remember yeah so i should have mentioned nobody thought i'd address it then but it should have that's been that i mean regardless they had a lot of good people it should have been addressed right we tried to do all the audiences right we tried to adjust to address that in in the cobra vision committee which i was on you came to celebrities you had to deal with those issues when you were getting your veterans dave got us into as a citizen before he was even elected so it's got to change out and it it'll have to go to a work session first patty if that's the procedure that yes sir that is i also think that there has not been this there has not been this building activity for years so right now we have four homes being built in my cul-de-sac on 22nd street four and it is chaos well they are real high but not eighteen inches nothing but the eighteen inches of upgrade on that those four but all of us would be working around the clock to review every variance based on what they're doing right yeah so i think we should think about modernizing when i'm 100 and for doing it that's exactly the hit the nail in the head jane because now the biggest issues this board of adjustment has ever heard in the past has been pools dots uh carolina what else have we done here and the plan isn't to have everywhere every new home that's coming you have to get a variance have to get variance that's why we look at the bigger picture and tony and i discussed them with lynn and chris do we go for a variance on this collectively it's his decision where do we do an ordinance change and lynn advised us it's easier to do a variance time wise that is to do an ordinance change so would you help us if we go that route certainly yep whatever you guys need alone be more happy to attend a meeting and get my input from a design standpoint reviewer standpoint because quite honestly a lot of these pools are flying under the radar right now the applications are taking place um statements that they're being made either by the homeowner or the pool contractor says we're no more than 18 inches above the grain then the pools get built and they're on the ground three feet right and it's look at how we're driving there's two monster houses going in at the airport david is at one at the end of howard i'm not sure it's one now apparently it's enormous there's flanking vacant lots on both sides um either our board's going to get a whole lot of variances or we change the ordnance and that's kind of where we're headed but i have a question for tony tony so your house right now currently both your neighbors are above grade higher than you so engineering-wise what do you do to prevent tony's house currently from getting overloaded well the way our pool and our deck is designer that doesn't go from la line to lobby at the grounds so we have our present grade on either side of the pool necessarily in any water flows just either neighbor over it would go back and forth what about your neighbors you have the he has the grass there too you know he has a container yeah so you have to have some sort of non like graded was saying yeah i think drainage needs to be addressed yeah i mean it's it's a couple of those homes that one down there on the boulevard in delhi you know looks like five to six foot almost above the above the road and the house right next to it has a retaining wall that's at least six foot that's not seven that they're looking at right there now that happened the one tony's talking about happened in 2009 and the backlash was incredible because that i mean they built the pool at grade and the house was raised up four feet out of the ground then you needed a good definition of what great is and at what time that the grave was actually you know established guys are not unique either treasure island has a has a code um in their code they don't allow anything higher than three feet in someone's backyard they establish grain at the seawall um because they're going through the same thing where you get somebody comes in you build a pool the pool's elevated and then now you have a fence around it right to protect it from that um so now somebody that's sitting at their existing grade house next to it is now looking at essentially seven or eight feet of the side of a pool and fence and then you know the hedges so i know every last different every lot is um unique but free to your guys benefit a lot of the lots out here are a lot higher a lot more maybe a couple feet higher but mostly what i see down like uh treasure line checker island and madeira beach so you guys have a little bit of relief to work with which helps tremendously i did want to touch on you kept saying retaining what are you talking about returning walls off of the seawall perimeter walls around the outer deck of the pool four foot high walls maximum in the city i don't honestly know if it's still on the books but it has been forever when the county was doing planned review you had to come in and show that you were building a maximum of a four foot high wall on the outside of your pool and the elevation of the pool might be relative to that to that wall so many of the homes david even like pat magovitch's house right down here that was built five or six feet out of the ground she had to have a series of steps out coming out of the home down to the pool does yours have steps coming up to your club stepping down so you walk out and i say hello but a lot of these houses that again take six feet above uh grade quote unquote to the actual ground before the house established a new grade six feet five feet higher those houses if you walk around the city do have steps coming down eight inches eight inches eight inches in order to have a maximum wall around that pool forefoot there's violations on that all over the place too and the house tony just talked about on the corner of boulevard and ben island avenue people in the back are the ones that got slammed and that had a direct effect on the ordinance change in 2014. 18 inches wasn't right it just it's time to be correct i'm curious if you have the pool deck that's three or four feet high with existing grade then you guys are required for railing around that pool deck if it's above over thirty two you know it's where we go next nathan that's a big question so do we have a meeting um this goes to council doesn't it or do we talk to does someone from council have to bring it to a discussion to go towards who establishes the agenda at a work session the city manager so mr kelly you probably would want to talk to mr riefler to get it on the agenda for a work session okay does it need any kind of does to put the item on the agenda does it need a council member's recommendation or does it have to come to a permanent council member no it does not okay well is it the consensus of our board of adjustment that we'd like to see this go this ordinance go to work session and we can give input yes [Music] hey mike michael i was going to ask barb to be out there all right as far as any any permit that's pulled in the city i've had an experience recently i think all the permits should be inspected by mr carrier or representative from the city before the permit is issued because just to give you a little idea i had to remove a black wall on my property and the neighbors have been putting their soil up against that wall for the last 20 some years and that wall has to come down and now that property is 12 inches over my property and they have a retaining wall that's there and it's over the retaining wall because that wall has been raised so we've got all the soil and all that water now will spill over into my property so i think all the permits that are issued in the city need a review before before they're issued once they're applied for and then somebody inspect them inspect the ground inspect what was going to be done whether it's a fence or a driveway or anything to make sure the drainage on these properties isn't going to be effective on idle property thank you mark al are you having to do that at all now um or you just go by the architectural plans if if there's any questions we'll go out to a site visit we go for both uh treasure island and very beach sometimes the plan doesn't always show you what's actually going on in the field um sometimes there's plan changes right during construction and we'll be called out so we do provide those services marv that's what you're talking right a site is it well a site visit correct i mean uh my permit was pulled to remove the wall and the neighbors have a permit for offense an offense is being put in but the level of the land is not being addressed at this time so there's going to be water spilling over on my property if not ground and there's an issue but if it would have been inspected before they would have found that there was an issue but unfortunately now things are going to move forward the permits have been issued and the problem will not be addressed patty so the recommendation is that you think i should go to the city manager and discuss this and hopefully put it on a work session yes sir okay any other comments for any board members or anybody in the audience if not i want to thank mr gardella our newest member on the board of adjustment for coming in because he's late he has to buy drinks up the hill at bonefish at what time tomorrow i want to apologize to the board and the applicant and now i was dealing with two ac repairs at the apartments i have and time got away from me and i had to get the guys in these apartments with the tenants not home so i apologize for keeping people waiting it wasn't my attention we're glad to have you what a first meeting that's right we already did everything we're done yeah we're done since we're done i'll entertain it and entertain a motion to adjourn mr bean mr elliot members of the board thank you for an interesting meeting al it was great to see you obviously we will be seeing more of you not only in board of adjustment cases but in the issues involving us to make this ordinance be updated directly with common sense we stand in germany"
