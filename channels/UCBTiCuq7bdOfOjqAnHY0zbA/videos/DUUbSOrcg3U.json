and address and uh how you doing Randy l 10313 Main Street um just to let you know an incident from Saturday night we had a we had a little dinner get together for my son-in-law's mother's birthday and uh one of the guests 85-year-old fellow named Rick castelle from the he couldn't make it till about 8:00 anyhow when he left he found he he had a $55 ticket for parking on the street from an officer I think his name is I anyhow uh I know the sheriff just do what they got to do and that's all fine own but but my issue is for the council he came in off the bridge he turned on G B work he made the ride on 12 and looped around the heso to get to my house okay on when you turn on to 12th probably about 50 ft up right past the first driveway on the right hand side you've got a 25 mph speed limit sign and a No Parking anytime on the street sign okay this the speed limit signs are 24 in High by 18 wide the little sign that says no parking on the street is 12 in wide by 18 in high okay it's it's very it's very at an 85-year-old I mean I know not the park there somebody comes from out of time you're not going to see you make the turn and you're looking ahead and you don't you can't read the little letters on on my street if you came if you would have turned on 13th Avenue 13th Street here's that same sign that's 18 by 24 the speed limit the no parking sign's 24 wide by 30 High okay so if you look the other signs on the corner of 12 that's alv Gul Boulevard the neighborhood walk signs 24 by3 uh the uh going ahead to where the crosswalk is between 12th and 13th there's a don't block the intersection that's 24x 30 I just think it it's it's stinky that the guy got a ticket for missing a sign that's that's basically 12 by 18 with little letters you know it's just I think I think the sign should be uniform in size now that that's that's the only thing I got to say it's it's very easy if you drive up 12 you see it's a little sign that's and these two speed limit signs these two speed limit signs way I took them but they're the same size okay the speed signs are the same size and you can see how narrow this 12th Street no parking sign is compared to the one on 13th 13th is like like all the other standard side that don't block the intersection neor wash and all that but you put a little tiny one in there I feel bad for the 85y old guy had to pay a $55 ticket because of some little sign that soon as you make the turn at 8:00 at night you know you're not going to be able to read the little letters but that's a thank you for your comments would any other citizens like to speak all right and comments are now closed uh we're on to item three which is a presentation on January 22nd a man on a c ski capsized in Rough Waters at the six Street access a strong underr prevented the man from getting back on his vessel while he was also being pulled further out to sea fortunately two brave men came to his Aid and helped him back to the shore one of those men is here this evening Chief Jeffrey Davidson would you please join me at the yes there all right Chief Jeffrey Davidson in recognition of your courageousness and life-saving actions on January 18th 2024 the city of Belling Beach thanks you for your selfless Act of B thank you for your service I already did you couldn't be oh speaking of the fire chief we're on the item number four which is a presentation from the sun fire and resue District good evening mayor council members and Community Jeffrey David ire Chief Coast um wanted to give you the month report for the month of February um in the month of February there were uh to B beachs there was 15 calls for fire and Emergency Medical Services into Belair Beach um the district is moving forward we've talked about the purchase of the land uh on the Northern end of Indi Rocks Beach to better serve valair Beach uh that property is only 1.2 mi from this location um and it's going to greatly improve our response times and the current plans are to house an advanced life support uh fire suppression engine there on the North uh with three firefighter paramedics in the meantime uh we have obtained a transport capable Rescue Unit from the county to utilize when Staffing permits over the next year uh we are in the process of purchasing a new Rescue Unit uh with a written agreement from the county forthcoming and we're also working with the county to get that unit funded with two paramedics over the next 2 years uh then will be here permanent and fulltime uh we are also getting ready to award a contract to build a fire station and Emergency Operations Center on the mainland with the anticipated completion date of August of 2025 and that building is going to replace the 50 58y old fire station and serve as our emergency Operation Center uh Kyle has a open invitation to stay the ESC during hurricanes and major events so he can stay closer to B reach a jet ski with rescue SL has also been purchased was a funded by a very generous donation um to the district and as you know Sun are the busiest Marine rescue program in the county and the additional units can assure that rapid access um to to get victim to get two victims in the water uh we're in the process of outfitting it and training IT training with all of our members right now and as anticipated a unit will be in service around April in January the fire department participated in the causeway cleanup efforts and we would like to participate in all the future events we're currently in the planning stages of the hurricane Expo with the city of Val reach with the dates to be determined and our firefighters and param completed 860 hours of fire and EMS training during the month of February thank you Chief Council any questions or comments for the fire chief yes um congratulations Chief and thank you service I do have a question what is a transport capable rescue un okay um that is a an ambulance that's capable to transport to the hospital the way the system works here in pelis county is that all the fire departments every unit is an advanced life support unit and we work off a first responder system so we're the first people to get to the emergency the first firefighters and perits all of our Personnel are either firefight are either paramedics or emergency medical technicians and having the quicker response sign in the ambulance company we are called The First Responders um the transport to the hospital is done by a private company currently and there are times and certain criteria where the fire department can transport to the hospital to if it's a life-threatening and the ambulance is a certain distance away they haven't gotten there yet for example then we can transport that patient get into a Trauma Center get into the emergency room faster currently we don't have that capability so we have to wait on in English so this is something we've been working as a team with the County EMS Administration and we have a 2-year plan that we're we're um getting towards the end of to have that be unit so in the event that we arrive on scene of a critical call that we need to get that patient to the hospital right away and the ambulance is not quite yet there then the fire can transport with the medical director's permission thank you well that's uh much better service to the citizens yes yeah quick question on the second bullet Chief is the uh the purchase of that land is there already a facility building there or are we going to have to build one so no there there is not uh a facility there it's a portion of land um that belongs to a business that were you were going to purchase this part of their property and build on but with the contract that we are entering an agreement with to build our Mainland they did a b a bid for that station as well so we'll be able to move forward with that one uh pretty pretty quickly perfect thanks right thank you any other questions or comments okay I have just one question um moving the firehouse to the new location what what will that do to response time for us how much how many many minutes will it say oh many many minutes so the average response sign will to BS providing that they're in quarters or in the area will be 2 minutes um 2 minutes yes yes sir and that's what you know we trive the county standard is 7 and2 minutes and we try to get our events on scene in four minutes whenever possible not always possible especially with the gulf traffic but that has been the challenge for many years is that the distance between our station at inrocks Beach and the next close station is almost 6 miles so we've been working on this project for years and it's finally kind of come to fruition but in the meantime we'll be able to sta that Rescue Unit uh they call it an episonic unit so whenever we have the Personnel uh for example spring break we're going to hire back to make sure that that unit is Staff we're going to get with Kyle to uh make sure our Personnel can stage up here and be to come in and use the facilities if they needed to um I but um that's going to definitely um provide a much better service to this area CU our Station 27 University is very busy the station in Clear Water which is our automatic a partners and the station over the bridge in Largo we all work together it's quite a long response time uh especially if they're not coming from their station and you're getting a unit from the next closest St so we wanted to always provide the best response times that's the plan we've been working on for for many years now you've been uh you've been working on this project for a long time and I appreciate you not giving up and and staying on course we we all realize that you're doing it for us thank you want let you know uh as it um moves along and of course we want to have you come to any ceremonies that we have with that and we look forward to getting that unit Services absolutely looking forward to thank you very much thank you all right we are up to item number five this is a presentation from the pelis county sheriff's office beginning with the monthly law enforcement report good afternoon mayor councilman um so as far as the sherff report B monthly stats are consistent with December there were no property for one second can you announce your name I'm sorry I'm cor G with the Sheriff's Office okay so again the uh statistics for January there were no property crimes no burglaries no thefts um no motor vehicle thefts or anything like that reported um on top of that there were two people arrested within the city uh both being misdemeanors for driver's licenses and one for violation of probation after that our deputies have been really keeping up with the director patrols that have been requested by the city and the citizens um so between the director patrols traffic stops are up to we had 118 traffic stops uh last month which is really helping to keep some of the speeding and other traffic violation enforcements down more so for The Pedestrian safety and stuff like that too uh especially as we get closer into the Spring Break and summer months um beyond that everything is pretty consistent again with the month prior um minimal ordinance violations the vehicle uh illegally parked stuff like that we actually only had 26 last month for any illegal parking citations or Warnings there were two only two traffic crashes actually um in January and both of those basically had no outside influence over just accidents um nothing that appears to identify any problems congested areas roadway deficiencies or signage any questions or comments yes Mr um not sure if you heard the citizen um remarks about paring in the street violation yes sir I know fot has a million different requirements for like Signs and he pointed out the 25 M I know s liit has to be a certain standard sign yes or Size Doesn't a paring sign have to have the same typical so yes any and all roadway signage uh included for pedestrians and sidewalks and stuff like that uh do have a federal or a Florida Department of Transportation um regulation so they have to be a regulatory size in order to be enforceable a lot of times those sizes are based on off of the speed limit in the area the size of the roadway and stuff like that and again all of those even from the Department of Transportation in Florida conform to the standards of the National Highway Traffic Safety Association which are consistent throughout the country yeah what I'm saying is the sign that he pointed out um according to the visitor was very small letter um I don't think it conformed with the re with the other sign and I think that would be a good argument to that take it removed I don't think it can be done at this level um so yes that can be directed towards the County Highway uh they're the ones that normally regulate in would it be County or would it be your city so your city would ultimately be responsible for changing out that sign and then normally it's facilitated through County Highway um they're the ones that have the signs readily available where they can be purchased from and you know any of that thank you um but yes no it's if it is a Department of Transportation sign which there will be a sticker on the back of then it does conform to the standards for that roadway nothing stand though that a larger one can't be put in place and it doesn't have it sticker it's not conform correct thank you any other questions or comments yes I have a question about the enforcement of the flashing pedestrian signs the lights um I recognize that if somebody pushes the button takes a card and recognize that it's there but it seems as though there's a lot of people just baring straight through them what is the enforcement process for those and what has been your experience so actually it's interesting you bring that up um here just last month and the end of January and in February I believe two times um this particular shift that we worked we actually conducted traffic initiatives for The Pedestrian crosswalks and the violations and that's why violations between pedestrians and motorists so either people not pushing the button or waiting for the signage or just running across the road or just not even utilizing them at all um so we did do initiative on that I don't have the numbers with me uh I can say that they were highly effective we actually did that amongst all of the beach cities from b beach All the Way South to madir beach um those actually seem to be quite fruitful um most of it was general education uh that we were you know more so to in Waring and trying to remind people please utilize these things or here for a reason they really do make a difference and in that safety um so we have been actively uh just on our owner board looking into that and trying to more have a little bit more visibility a lot of times deputies now especially during the night hours are sitting there somewhere within the vinity of these crosswalks in order to be able to see them observe them and be visible in that same area hopefully just provide a little bit more enforcement guidance good thank you I'm going to add to that um I'm hoping that they're also watching the pedestrians because there is uh some personal responsibility you don't slap the button as you're entering the street it's uh there's been many times where I've had to Locker now where people just are not paying attention or taking for granted that that light is going to automatically C yes and that's the big thing when I say that we were equally enforcing it between any violations with pedestrians or motor vehicles um a lot of that being the situation where a pedestrian will just stuff out as you're describing and causing another vehicle to take evasive action or you know some sort of defensive action um normally by hitting the breaks pretty hard so you know with that uh I do agree you know that is a major portion of it and the education that I put out to the deputies um that work for me and stuff along these beaches and during these initiatives was you know if we explain it more so to the citizens that regardless of right away if the light's flashing you know and you feel you can safely walk doesn't meet the laws of physics so ultimately who's going to win that battle um when we're pushing through that so even more so is kind of a way of putting it in mind well while we're talking about safety and saving lives um I've know noticed that lately more than I've ever seen uh these fast motorcycles uh they suddenly don't follow any rules any laws whatsoever and they're leaving between cars uh I was coming home before yesterday oh no no no it was Friday I was coming home and one of those little Japanese Racers decided that he was going to pass all the cars aing cway on uh on the basically the shoulder of the bridge uh and he was probably doing 60 um I see it all the time but what I don't see is them getting pull over is it just bad timing they know what they're looking for what's going on in M County so in general um just from my best understanding and my enforcement actions on it um it's interesting to say that just actually one of these statistics in here I believe for the driving license suspended was mine in which uh there were two motorcycles that were going in towards Lardo off of the beach um I PL them at well over 100 mph on the shoulder passing a series of Parts the hard part with that is the speed of these motorcycles or capability of maneuvering and stuff like that it's hard for us to be able to catch up to them in a manner and enough to efficiently catch them um and catch up to them without them noticing that we are there following or something like that so we're trying to utilize a little bit more strategy um if we can we'll just try and let other deputies that are in the area or other law enforcement that are down the road in the direction of traveling know so that way we can kind of pick them up as they are and in that we bu our helicopter a lot of times um to see if they can fly over get eyes on them and then hopefully we have a little bit more of a an effort those violations and stuff like that take more time a lot more resources and so those traffic stops or that enforcement is happening way down the road or even at a later date in time as we are doing research to find out who those operators are and then administratively opening up citations and stuff and sending it to them okay appreciate you answer that question do we have any other questions or comments all right thank you so much right now we're on to the monthly Cod enforcement report good evening mayor councilman I'm Deputy Trump P County Sheriff's Office uh we actually had a pretty good month for code enforcement um with violations actually being mov down we did have a few new cases of excuse me unpermitted remodels of which um all of the cases have been able to work with the people work with the contractors however we've been able to close all of them with most of them obtaining permits um other than that we had um I just had 33 entries but basically it's a variation of all kinds of different orces anything from we're still working with a couple of pools to uh maybe some uh uh overgrowth and plants and things like that but for the most part uh the homeowners and everything have been pretty receptive as far as be going up and talking to them or working with them and trying to go through the problems um with that I would like to um just add one thing if I could uh to anybody that is watching the citizens of Bor Beach is if you are Contracting for some type of a service please make sure that they are um licensed contractors and make sure that you have some type of a contract written contracts that you know exactly what you're getting into what your responsibilities would be and I'm just going to use one example without names or anything else but I came across a um uh residence that was uh just beginning a solar hstone and I checked uh the contractors out and found that they had no permits through the city no permits through the county the company had not even been registered through the county uh or the state we found out later they had a parent company which begins in California they were registered with the state but basically there were no permits I had made contact with the uh elderly lady that lives there by herself uh she had been approached by this Solar Company and they gave her some extravagant story that she would not have to pay for any of this and it was all going to be installed for free and she had no contract nothing written she had only one phone number in California uh for somebody that she'd attempt to call and excuse me working through working with her and also working with pis County it was found that uh basically they had no permits or anything else no contracts and with the information that she was uh able to give us and work with um working with her she ended up basically telling the company uh that she no longer wanted her Ser or their services which was probably the a wise improving thing so just just a reminder to everybody is make sure you have contracts make sure you know what you're responsible for and make sure they're a licensed contractor so you know they are doing a good job for you I'm I'm curious uh would this be the same company to hand to door to door solicitors it may be possible but I I didn't get that far I'd have to check the record on that wasn't just just curious there was a company that was doing order okay uh any questions or comments for that yes Mr I want to jump on the mayor May wag want get a solicitation because we seem to get a lot of like magazine people I I I I I don't know your hours I don't want to know your hours especially we don't know your hours but it seems like they're early late afternoon spot on the have you need put forward um I I see they come to my great and what I can add to that is at any point if anybody has any solicitors or anything else or suspicious people for that matter if you don't know who they are contact the Sheriff's Office let us go and make contact with these guys and we will take care of business so with no problem that's what we're here for and you know going back on that as far as my hours my hours vary a little bit and I'm going to especially as we're going into the warmer months here and going into spring break I'm going to start varying my hours a little bit more uh because we're going to be trying to do or I'm going to be trying to do at least Beach patrols and everything else for the ordinance or the ordinances out of the beach and everything else so I vary a little bit just so I can do different things and work Sundays once in a while so that we can like I had one day you know contractors out working at a house on the Sunday and in contact with them they're very nice but we told them you know can't do that so I don't want any okay any other questions and comments no uh I will add that I had some solicitors come by my house the other day and so I actually bought some of their product as evidence but the box of cookies did not last that the rest of the evening so never mind well the evidence is gone thank you very much okay sir thank you all right now we're on to item six this is the city attorney's report thank you Mr Mayor uh as we sit here now it is March 4th 2024 we are in what should be the last week of session absence some extension I don't have some inside knowledge of one I just you never know what may happen um there's a lot to track and not a lot to report right now there's some clear division on some significant bills between what the Senate is doing and what the house is doing while not of the same import here by way of example the short-term rental bill has passed the Senate it's passed the house but in different version they need the same version to pass both chambers before the governor can sign it and there's only 4 days left for them to do so um one of the challenges we we face in tracking and accurately predicting what will happen in the legislative session is during the last 3 days of session the the each of the chambers are able to suspend certain rules and make things happen a little more quickly or or by some not altogether um unpredictable but unorthodox being um and so until until it's over until uh that handkerchief Falls for sign die on Friday um it is hard to say precisely how this will shake out this will not be like last session where there was just a ton of legislation approved by the super majority and signed by the governor um I think each chamber as well as the executive branch are asserting a little bit more of their independent judgment which we didn't see quite as much of last session as evidenced by the governor's veto in the last week on the social media Bill uh so we are tracking it closely you will get an end of session report from from my office on in terms of what what's come down and as well as any uh Florida Liga cities updates you may be tracking that provide um legislative updates otherwise um we continue to we as as you know from uh our meeting last week we've begun the Land Development code review um and your input is critical to that um subject to all the cautions and advisories I gave you at that meeting but uh with that uh I'm happy to answer any questions you have and otherwise uh look forward to what should be an interesting month in March with our elections here um we I will be closely tracking the results and also how all of those play out in the event any one or all of them don't don't uh succeed or if they all succeed for that matter what that means for us I'm providing you an update post elction day on okay now what uh so that's that's the issue I'm probably following most closely for this even any questions or comments for the City attorney Mr the shortterm yes sir um I know there's only 4 days left and those are matching up but um would that either vers would that impact us because I'm getting a lot of residents no no one knows how to read things I just I think that's a really accurate way of saying this no one knows how to read these including the legislators um the the the the short answer is yes and no the no of it is it doesn't change your rules yes because it applies Statewide if you were to do something to change your regulations that's my question if if you rock the boat going get with it but but if we if we don't rock the boat in their current form and of course they can change this in the next four days in their current form they preserve the the language in codes for and restriction adopted before June 2011 Your Land Development codes governing duration and frequency preate 2011 here you should gold and underline should be fine however when you look at the Senate bill for example it has language in there that says not withstanding the preemption in 509 0327 a well none of the courts have found that 7A which is talks about that um law in and restaurants uh regulation is is preempted to the state um no court has ever found that that is a preemption of a city's regulation of short-term rentals and by just adding a not withstanding this it suggests they're trying to broaden and say oh always meant this everybody knew that so I can't say for sure and and I think there's good reason when you see some of that confusion on its plain terms it doesn't it does not void or strike the Safe Harbor for pre 2011 question on its face it does not do that will they attempt to say it does otherwise somehow who knows either version either version does not so for this community that's why I said at the outset it's a less concern here I still think it's a concern because it's a new preemption and every preemption should trouble uh us as as communities that thrive on own Rule and again my my con to the extent I'm I'm sound like I'm equivocating it's only because they're adding some language that I think is sort of changing the script and saying it was always this way so that's just clarifying a thing you could never do um but I don't think it would void your pre- 2011 restrictions in its current in either current form again and and by the way when I say they're not the same the differences are significant it's not simply like one of them has a 60-day registration the other has a 90-day the Senate bill um for example allows you to regulate or have a registration based with an occupancy limitation based on two per bedroom plus two with add some additional permission for certain square footage the house version uh up until recently said sleeping accommodations they're suggesting that that's going to be interpreted based on the fire code well the fire code was never intended for overnight days it's intended for how many people can safely evacuate a space during an event so if you have a birthday party how many people can safely get out not many people can sleep here generate waste here and all those other things so those are some differences the the house bill for example also has language saying that the registration process to the extent communities can create a registration process will be administered by the tax collector that's never been a part of the discourse before this year so and and it's not in the Senate version so if they're going to work it out they have some real differences to resolve and the the house sponsor uh representative Griffiths as recently as last week in the Press was saying the house will not be taking up the Senate's version so it sounds like there's a little bit of a game of chicken legislative chick chicken happening on who's going to Blink it just seems every legisl session for as long as I can remember something the PO get ugly headed yeah uh and and and those that's frankly the thing that's easy to focus on there's a lot more preemptions that we haven't been talking about and once we know the lay of the land we'll talk about there's a bill that I think is going to be unsuccessful that dealt with when you could hire and fire a city manager a City attorney you know I I I don't know what purpose that served but those are the sorts of things it's more than you realize and more than your average citizen might take interest in but definitely affects your job up here whether you're four five or seven thank you any other questions or comments Mr Mo I I did have one question I um heard Rumblings of a possible bill that would or maybe it was an amendment that would exempt those currently serving uh from form six has that gained any traction in all if it has May or I'm not aware of it I I'll search for it I imagine if it had gained traction it would be closer to front page media given the dozens of resignations across the state but I will continue I'll look into that and if I find something El circulated I would take silence as a no in terms of my followup I I want to say it was early last week I got this and I just I wasn't able to move on I I didn't think it was going anywhere but still I'll pass it off to you the information I appreciate that it is a challenge when you're tracking the legislative session because something like that can get buried in a bill that has little else to do with form Stakes it's just an Ethics code and you know they throw this wrer in so if you do have any resources and it and and that goes for all four of you if there is something that you while while I generally work for the council as a whole if there's a discreet thing you say hey I heard this is this true about the session or here's somebody's telling me house bille 8675309 do this is that true I'm happy to look into it if it's related to City business I just assumed it was going nowhere because it's the same assumption as big of a deal as it is it's not being talked about all right any other questions or comments uh not all right thank you Mr Mo I appreciate all the updates all right now we're on to item number seven uh Mr Reaper city manager repard thank you mayor um Mr but it's it's stepped out but um addressing the uh no parking on the street signs I do know um it was 2018 when we downsized those signs but I will check into the requirements um I try to do a quick search and find about get some guides from the county on what what size they actually need to be for our residential streets um I wanted to mention to him I wasn't sure if he was aware that we have the uh the on street parking um you know the residents can call in and let us know that they're having a party and you know we send it to the Sheriff's Office and then they're aware so that nobody gets ticketed um the uh going through the city manager report the Golf Boulevard undergrounding we're still moving along with that um the uh we're going on the North side we're getting uh refusal uh signatures if uh Duke Energy is requesting that we have easement for the resident where the equipment's going so um that is what the uh utility uh contractors in Florida are doing right now they're just getting a hold of people and either getting the signature yes or no if they can get an easement for that property um again Southside um southa caway we're pending on Duke at this point um so we're waiting on that I will say though that we have received all of our funding of penny4 up to this fiscal year from the county so we're all up to date on that we paid in and received the reimbursement the uh storm mod Improvement project the start date for that is going to be March 18th excited to get that going the uh code review project we are going to cover chapter 94 zoning at our next work session and uh that was chosen because it's a very broad section and it kind of dables in a lot of different elements of the code um and I think discussing that up front will help us um as we go through other sections the uh RP for Audi Services uh last year Salt March came in in the March meeting um with the draft um they do not have the draft complete but it's supposed to be done this month but the way we're going to do is we're going to get the draft take it to the audit committee have them look it over make any recommendations and then we'll bring it to council where salt marsh will do their presentation for the acceptance um the new website launched last Thursday I sent an email out just to let you know um we're still kind of working through some of the The Kinks making sure all our content got transferred over um but uh we we are uh excited to have the new format it's based on the Civic plus layout that uh a lot of cities city of Eden town of all L use um but hopefully what this does is we can set it up in a way that our citizens can find information quickly that they're looking for but any suggestions you have when you when you prev that site please just we'll make adjustments I think the uh website looks great um it's probably easier for someone who's never been there because I knew where to go for everything prior to the new website so it took me a while to finding the code and things like that nice job and uh well we got an idea from what other cities have done we want to open up a uh a photo submission for the residents um that we can use on the website so um modern bones Tak pictures these days that's the way to kind of get capture all the different images of the city get sun sunsets and each pictures um we've been interviewing for the admin assistant uh we've had so FLW out of five interviews we set up we actually had we have two candidates that were considering um when it came to the question and we kind of saw this coming um for the hourly wait we are advertiseing at the $18 per hour um the candidates that we have considering the position uh would suggested that they would start at $20 per hour now the $18 per hour um was our lowest paid uh wage we uh raised the uh service worker two wage um last meeting that went from 18 to 20 so right now with the vacancy that we've had in the in assisted position we have the money we don't need to make a budget adjustment to make that $2 increase but I wanted to get the council's consideration on that because it would have to pass the next budget to maintain this position no we can just do an inal vote because it's not a budget change this year everyone's thoughts here I think we have to recognize the current Marketplace and that's what it's demanding and I find that if you try to go too low you end up spending more money you get ineffective so the right candidate yes that $2 an hour might actually keep them around whereas 18 might get them trained and then they go to another power so I think it's a good idea I do as well so candidates that you already interviewed Kyle yes had they been amable to whatever our rate was at that time would you guys been in a position where you would made the offer to one of them based on their skill sets and background and ability job so the two candidates that we interviewed that fill up the city application did not indicate the wage that they were um considering for the position so it came up in the interview um we had an advertise on the website at $18 per hour but that's the only spot so if they didn't if they saw the admin post on the sign they might have thought maybe it was negotiable but just by the candidates that we have are best candidates um 18 was a little low to start okay so if we raise it to to 20 which I think we're all fine with do you feel comfortable that you have a candidate in mind that would be willing to except that yes okay I'm not clear on that so did you have a candidate mayed out because it was de 20 no the only the only two candidates um that we interviewed that we feel are qualified both of them have indicated that they would like to start at $20 per hour we have one candidate in line that we would select but I just wanted to get um the council approval because it is the budget thanks continue Bud any other questions see the manager I do yes so Kyle on the stor water improvements projects has the contractor had the opportunity to sit down with the city and lay out a plan with respect to what streets they're going to begin and so on until the project is complete we have not had an a preconstruction meeting on site but um they have been agreeable to whatever we need so um given that Mr flut is doing the study right now for the 9th Street area um if that is complete and we have the presentation where we know what we're doing um I would consider that the southern part of the town the more uh crucial to get to um before storm season so as long as we're ready and we know what we're doing I would recommend that we start on the sou okay but right now there is no set schedule okay am I complet more budget um oh right we need to we need to find out what Mr F needs to come back and let us know where we're at on that I'm sorry to it's fine I just want to make make sure and I have complete confidence in you and that when the project starts when we get in um questions where somebody would say G is why was this street done before that street that we're prepared to have um and I know you will have you'll have an answer for why whether it was based on uh the current condition of Street a b or c was worse off based on the studies that we did that's type of thing so that there's some um sance of reasonability there as to why we did Street a before Street B and so on down so we'll be prepared for that and then we have discuss with the contractor um you know grouping four to five streets together so um I think they'll be looking to us to give Insight of where where we're starting because we already kind of had conversations on you know where um depending on what we're doing on n9th street so does that make sense we don't want the contractor jump back and forth from the north side and the South Side Etc so that's all good thank you and they they will be doing um the door hangers L before and and interacting directly um with residents for information um you know when they come through on those streets so they'll be they'll be putting they'll be knocking on the doors if the resident answers you know explain to them what the project timeline is for that area and then um if they're not there they're going to leave a contact information so that they get the information that they want and they will be working um you know as far as where them parking on one side and getting access to their driveways and all that great thanks anyone else yes when is Mr his di was was one or two months I can follow up on and find where he's at I think it' be good if we had the next session next working session is three weeks weeks well mayor I think U we may be speaking to that but we're trying to figure out the timing on the next working session given the election other schedule of concerns for the four members true I'd say whenever he's got the report you should just get it immediately we get it on our own time not have to wait on a presentation from okay I had was that your on the question okay I had a question also um we spoke briefly this morning about the bridge closures did you get any detail on that right now um I heard back from Brian Mal with the county he said that that he does not know any closure closure scheduled but that he would check into it um because they updated a weekly basis and then let me know what is the work that they're doing on the bridge I don't know I'll find enough they're putting signs on the bridge can uh Somebody explain to me why we're closing the bridge seon it's it's the the sign says lane closures and I think it's at night not very what is at night I mean 10:00 at night 6 in the morning I think that that bridge is wide enough for three lanes in the middle um so they're probably going to have you go around whatever jams together but um it definitely has raised some concerns in the community that everyone's wondering if they're going to have to go down to Indian Rocks Beach to get to public so so right now no but if there is any concern with the way they are doing it just let me know and if you uh if you do hear anything defended would you mind sending out a newsletter just everyone to see sure um I just want to mention real quick the hurricane information night we're going to be doing is is on uh April 3rd which is Wednesday um and that's going to involve theel G Fire War um the city the the pals County Emergency Management we have uh experts in the field of meteorology uh Mike play's already committed um and uh insurance agents to give up updates on the current state of insurance in Florida and trying to get thema a FEMA representative there um but yeah 6:30 to about 8:30 and um the idea is that we're going have ta to set up for information for these different organizations but also have a general uh like uh lecture area for audience seating um where you know every 30 minutes is a presentation is that it all right any other questions or comments all right thank you Mr reaper now we are on to the CIT clerk report I have nothing further to report okay uh any questions or comments for the city no thank you very much all right now we are on to the consent agenda this is items 9 and 10 uh this is for approval of the February 5th 2024 C council meeting minutes and approval of the February 27th 2024 city council work session minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve is written and presented motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I I any oppos all right the consent agenda passes all right now we are on to the regular agenda item 11 this is for consideration ordinance 24-1 this is the second reading uh City attorney Mora happy Mr Mayor this is ordinance 2024 01 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Belair Beach amending chapter 2 Administration Article 2 city council division one generally to create section 2-31 of the city's code of ordinances entitled annual salary for members of the city council and guidelines governing reimbursement providing for the implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for separability and providing an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance number 20241 by title of Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mo before we proceed would any citizen like to comment on this proposed ordinance see as we have none citizen comments are now closed Council I need a motion to approve ordinance 24-1 a moe motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by member Mr Roberts you have the Flor yeah we've uh we've discussed this and we discussed the benefits as to why we think this would improve our city interest uh for people wanting to be in the council it's the main driver I believe it's a it's a Minimus amount of money compared to other cities in the area and I think our mayor did a good job of providing us with that information showing what some of the other cities were paying their council members or commission members So based on those facts I think it makes sense for us to do this and I think we should go to a vote thank you Mr Roberts anyone else like to comment on this topic I I would just like to uh to add that um if this passes it does not impact this Council uh but it does give future councils the ability to uh to at least give something back to people who serve um also I believe that this goes hand in hand with uh items that are hearing on the ballot um in the upcoming election uh so there are no other comments uh grene would you please call council member Banker yes council member Roberts yes council member Elliott yes mayor gavis yes and so it passes unanimously uh work to do nothing thank you very much Council for uh assisting thisin all right now we are on to unfinished business we have any unfinished business so as we have none unfinished business is now over with now we're on to uh item number 13 there was no 12 there was no uh see there was no 12 or 13 I just add so now we're on to city council comments this month we begin with council member Bank um just briefly uh I've been working with Senator Scott's office still with this n NFI suit uh which is going back to actually Ming now she's the attorney for the state but um I appreciate Council and my co-council person get with this study that's coming up with the plooding because there's so many residents in the southern end of the city we have right here it's just pulling her hair out frustrated over the 50% rule the values of homes are not I hope believe that given uh it's really you're telling us all the ter comes down me um so I'm going to keep working at it all I can promise you I I feel your pain it could happen to me it could happen to anybody here so um I'll be out tomorrow at your house thank you Mr Baker uh up next is council member Roberts thank you mayor as uh most of us know we have some items that are going to be on uh up for vote coming up on on the 19th so anybody listening to this meeting I would like to um recommend that you take the time to read those items and understand them and if there's some questions you may have please may get the opportunity you can to contact anybody up here on the council um Pro not probably I'm going to be making my rounds around the city knocking on doors asking any body you have any questions if there's any way that I can help clarify some of the information we're going to be voting for I would absolutely do that it's an important set of of changes that we're proposing to the city Charter and I think it's something that everybody should consider very closely um I believe all four of the items will help our city and I be wouldn't happy to talk to anybody out there from a citizen standpoint to answer any questions you may have yeah thank you thank you Mr Roberts next council member of thank you I feel very privilege to live here still that we have such sorry about that it's been a while um I feel very privileged to he live here in val Beach and enjoy our lifestyle very very much um because we live in a Coastal Community I'm very acutely interested in environmental issues and so with that I'll be obviously looking very closely at our storm water Improvement project and I am attending a meeting on Wednesday uh to hear a report from St Petersburg regarding their own storm water uh Improvement project that's every way so I'd like to hear about their plans and anything that else that I can bring back to to this group um with that I attended the beginning launch of the um U panella's beautiful effort for their litter abatement and I did that um last week and um I'm getting involved also with the CR club and um we'll be learning more about some of the environmental issues that they're involved I'm sorry I'm losing my voice right now so um and to um follow up on what you said um Mr Banker the um oh yes 50 thank you very much the 50% Ru just so that people are aware um I did hear of another house that is likely coming up for sale because the individuals could just um constrained by that Ru and U with the increasing risk of flooding they're just finished and so losing another set of neighbors sometime soon so it's important issue and I thank you thank you very much council member Elliot um since we're talking about 50% rule I I know that uh if we do move forward and reduce it to one year it won't solve problems but what it will do is give a more manageable timeline uh if you if you do something it's on your house and a little bit of patience and planning uh perhaps some of these homes will be able to get the upgrades that they'd like to have um 5 years is a long long time especially in an area where we're uh subject to soft Sal water things Break um you're in one of the lower Ling areas uh storm water is a problem uh there's many many reasons why 5 years is just way too long for belir beach and whenever I realized that there were other communities that U seem to be reaping all the benefits without all the time it only seemed fair that we should be look into that and I know that uh city manager Reaper is is uh looking deeper into this to make sure that we're doing the right thing but right now it looks like switching to one year is the right thing to do so stay tuned hopefully we'll get this cleaned up a little bit more where it's not quite uh the pill swallow all right as always I'd like to thank every everyone who is here tonight or watch this meeting remotely as a resident of bell Beach I'd like to also remind everyone on what you just said of how important this upcoming election is to our city for Charter amendments on the ballot address the recent intrusive legislation designed to keep good candidates out of local government I and countless of others believe that local government is best run by the people who live within its boundaries Tallahassee preemptions and overregulation tear away at the thread of our unique friendly and beautiful Community as residents of Belair Beach is up to us to demonstrate that only we know what's best for our community these amendments will reduce the number of council members and send a clear message to Tallahassee that we are a strong Community willing to adapt to protect our Island Way of Life on March the 19th please join me and Ved yes for amendments 1 through 4 uh with that being said do I have a motion motion motion is made by Frank banker and seconded by Kim Shaw Elliot all in favor I any opposed all right good night"
