all right all right so here's the main item for today is to review and accept a dra draft annual comprehensive financial report for fiscal year ended September 30th 2023 so do I have a motion to approve that annual report uh I had some there were some preliminary documents that I had some questions sometimes in the past we would turn it over to Kyle if there's any comments for Kyle that he has from other but do we need a motion to open it up or think got a motion generally we have a motion and and then discussion and then discussion after the motion so you and I sorry I should have said that first the only under Robert's Rules you would do a motion to accept if you're going to open it up for discussion to clarify before you go to the motion that would be appropriate y you want to do yeah it's not how the city council does it so so it for the item it just be a motion to review or to go over I would so we need a motion to review and then a motion to accept yeah and accept and then we can go into discussion if approved yeah okay good all right so Tom did you motion to review well what I there was preliminary documents they're not a part of the report they're a part of the uh preliminary Pages unless you consider that part of the report that's part of it okay so what we're trying to do is just get a motion I move to accept or review or review sorry move to review thank and I'll second it thank you and a vote all in favor of reviewing and you got a motion on on the table you got to vote on it now to just yes yes thank you all in favor any opposed all right thank you Tom right yes all right the um the specific document is um not oh well the uh draft letter to uh city council which is r 1 2 3 and four um and I realize specifically on page two and it's the third paragraph I realize this fy2 2023 the information is correct about how we choose members but should that be specified just to clarify so people who read a document signed April 2024 aren't going to be confused about the composition of City Council in other words that it was for purposes of FY 2023 uh the uh Council uh was blah blah blah I mean there a clarification I if it's I don't want to play with the point if you think it's unnecessary I I'll withdraw that request but I had something else more uh uh direct I'll check on that I think it's based on what it was at the time oh sure it is yeah but it's dated the Letter's dated April 24th there is a signature block that notes who the council members are at uh one point during the all right all right okay uh then let me just move on to something more direct something that I had some experience with in my career so I I should clarify on page on the next one the uh the Professional Services agreement uh you have the Preamble and then you have the sections section 28 which is uh page six uh we're still on the we're on the next item that's the contract oh you want to do this one by one that's going to be next isn't that well I don't know necessarily if I got it out of order but if if if I you go ahead you go through each docent and then when we get to this I'll I'll talk I think you're looking at the contract for the RFP yeah this is uh Professional Services agreement right yes so we'll get to that in the next item that's item four thank you sorry do you have a copy of the uh audit or you just have it on there I just got down here do you want this do you want to see the copy did you print it oh thanks again normally uh Patty used to send those to us but not that it needs to be but I just thought we'd have a reference here so that's why I didn't print I can print one that's right yeah I'm trying to get used to this iPad so the only only thing is on page 61 that that 23 column needs to be um widened because cuz it's just got you see the first revenues yep yep I saw that one yeah I got a couple of that that and then um page 74 there was a typo it was uh I was I was pleased I didn't have to capture catch any numbers we didn't have to repeat that one yeah from last few years deficiency yeah so the second on page 74 MH uh of the document second column from the right says Total Primary forment should probably be government okay that's kind of I'll check I like that [Music] anybody else have any comments I have a few um on uh the manager report uh romanet one the first page it mentions Gap accounting um and uh you accountants here can help me out with that but should it also address government auditing standards Gap is literally accepted accounting right principles and it does not mention government auditing standards the the report itself mentions both this letter says that it's only in accordance with gap so it kind of Skips the government yeah that's a great question you can just ask them if they need to well okay um and then just a point of interest on romanet 2 the very uh end of the page it says the region which includes Beller Beach and the unincorporated area within panelas has a population of 1 million is that correct with three surrounding Cy is that is that correct a million people check it I think so P county is a million Hillsboro County is a little over a million okay but when you throw Sarasota and everybody at it's three and a half po County B um okay um if we're in the report itself uh page two also mentions um it it says there with generally accepted auditing standards and government auditing standards so there it's mentioned both places which is good then excuse me some of my questions I've resolved in the meantime so forgive me while I look at this um [Applause] put tabs on this and I [Applause] didn't that may out be all that I have on the report itself does anybody else have any comment I just um Kyle this was your first full year as city manager yes I just wanted you on page 23 just congratulate you I mean every Department had a positive variance the budget so well done great job yeah yes most definitely thank you there's no further questions I'd move to accept [Applause] second all right we have a motion to accept the draft report all in favor I any opposed motion carries [Applause] very good now we move on to agenda item number four uh which is the RFP request for proposals for a certified public accountant uh to perform the audit next year and to establish the factors uh to use in that evaluation process so do I have a motion to I I would like to to uh comment on it so I move to review someone wants to second I can tell you the two points I have I'll second the motion to review uh we have a motion and a second to review the RFP and the uh factors in consideration of that RFP all in favor I any opposed motion carries thank you very much if uh I may on page five of the uh request for proposal it it's a silly uh thing but it's a a simple typo I think you meant on this let's see 1 2 3 4 5 fifth paragraph second line it should be of a square mile add Square oh yeah a square mile thank you I I had that noted too um but I had I couldn't figure out okay we're talking about length do we need width too much better square mile all right and if I may there's a second matter uh that I saw but it's this is purely a technical one it's a citation and it's uh a p 6 uh section 28 this is the uh the uh criteria Professional Services agreement gra okay um and on page six section 28 immigration compliance I I've given to Kyle the the way that we we normally cite it that that was my career included immigration and I I the citations are a little bit off so I gave him the corrected one It should read immigration on the second line immigration reform Control Act of 1986 8 USC and then section 1324 small a at SEC and and it's just an auditing away the Congress neighor number of the statutes there is a 324 uh that has a whole list of subsections and now they created a new 324a which includes uh employer sanctions and the like and and and and so the first sub paragraph is 324a sub uh paragraph a is very confusing but that's the way it is I gave him the exact wording that I think would be okay ACC appreciate your background thank you see I there's a reason I was on this committee I finally figured it out and the and the fifth six line starts um violation section 274e of the federal immigration Employment Act uh it it's more correct stated uh section 324 uh I'm sorry section 274 did I misread it section 274 cap a and then pen e close P of the US immigration and nationality act would be the correct way that at least those in the field would say it so I don't know I guess but I'm not going to blame this on Randy but someone Tred it yes uh Rob eer Felder Randy's colleague okay I'll give this back to him all right well there's I gave you the the actual statute that was passed so you can see how they numbered it the second page of that [Applause] so any other comments I just open it up to Kyle to have some questions or just to talk about you why the why and U the timing and and maybe even some of the things that Heather shared as far as what's going on in the marketplace with bids maybe maybe before that then I do have a few just technical comments here sure um one would be on page four just a formatting glitch the RFP yeah on the RFP um on page five and the same paragraph that you raised um which is right above scope of work it says fire services are through pelis County aren't they through Sun Coast mhm okay so that would be a correction there okay uh on Page 6 of 14 um and new accountants might be able to help with this but it says that the proposal shall the first bullet point on the bottom The Proposal shall not substitute the individuals identified in the engage as the engagement Partners without notifying the city manager one is do we want to broaden that um because not all organizations would have Partners uh but um are they identified as engagement managers or what's what's the common term that would be used partner it is partner firm even if it's not a partner yeah even shareholder okay all right um and then um and it shouldn't if we if they have to notify the city manager do we want to have some sort of amount of time a prior notice with you can't substitute anybody without two weeks prior notice or what would be reasonable there or what's customary do we have that in the contract too it might be [Applause] covered good point anybody have any thoughts there cuz I don't know what would be typical but it seems like section 11 successors and the signs it's on page four well that's who's so like if they sell the firm um the new firm would be also Bound by this contract but within the firm let's say someone retires yeah somebody retires they say okay now Joe's going to do it now instead of Mary um do we need any kind of Prior notice what if somebody doesn't like Mary or should we have any kind of say in that I I don't know uh 30 60 days um notice I think is reasonable I do too I would so I would suggest then that that be changed without um we we're not going to control what a firm does or if somebody wants to retire but they still have to perform to the stand but they should notify us within 30 days of 60 days of retirement or change of change of partner what um or even reasonable without reasonable prior notice to the to the city manager we can put the the day amount that way it's not in question all right I would concur because you could have different definitions of what would be considered re reable yeah that's always that's always a it down love that word see I was thinking as the banker I like the word reasonable it's in my favor but now I don't like the word reasonable so but we we we do need time to consider if anyone on the committee or somebody on the council has some uh type of uh relationship that needs to be addressed good point with the new person that's coming some perhaps 30 days prior notice to the city manager right 30 uh in the second bullet point The Firm selected shall either submit progress reports or hold periodic meetings I would suggest including not less frequently than quarterly and do you generally have quarterly meetings with your Auditors Kyle what do you think about that is that oh we'll take that out that's a little restrictive how often does Heather talk to them see that's why she put it in I I think we need more progress meetings Okay um I don't what does it say in here we had it says periodic periodic I would suggest periodic not less frequently than quarterly and upon reasonable request of the city manager okay we'll put quarterly yeah we just wanted more updates yeah normally is like they do the report then you hear from them next year when it's time to start terrible yeah and we don't really know where they're at in the whole process before they're you know we're asking for a draft like progress reports or there's no currently well that's not as far as when the draft was delivered that's been longer than we everything's going well with the audit we have no questions were but I saw the RP the RFP the draft is do by the second week of February yeah we really they've not made that as long as we've been doing this and but period we should really request periodic status reports should be delivered to the voot committee or to the city council I mean at least I don't know anybody who does work for anybody and they do the scope is over a year's time and they don't give you some information about where they're at how it's going and you know so that would that would be my suggestion to add not less frequently than quarterly and upon reasonable request of the city manager okay so let's say you just had a quarterly meeting he said she said that I'll get this to you next week here's the you know and the draft comes in and it's just not at all what you expected you would have the right then to call another [Applause] meeting I still have a question related to this typically how long does it take for an auditing firm to conduct an audit of this scope I think that would drive the frequency of periodic reports required I'm not so that's what I'm trying to find out so my experience is you know February is 35 days days after our fisal year end okay so the shorter the window the more expensive the audit so if you required it within 90 days then the fee goes up but if you require it between 120 and 150 the fee goes down so I think where we are kind of drives so we're in that 135 150 window that's February 15th right that's 90 120 and 15 yeah so do they charge more if you ask for quarterly and then if you want another one and based on the results I mean do they put that into their they pricing yeah they they they may I mean if we want to ask them well they can put in their pricing here's the fee for the audit and then here's the fee for the quarterly meetings cuz they do yeah historically you cuz it sounds like they weren't in there before but you're specifically wanting to put them in there now like with the time frame so I didn't know if that would adjust what they charge it might do we know how the other any Professional Services like that would be expected to give you at least two or three times within the audit period an update I wouldn't expect to be charged for that we haven't been that's why I asked I know I agree with you I I I think we should assume that there is not going to be a cost to give us an update saying we're at oneir complete or we're blocked because we're waiting on information from the city or something of that nature exactly and other than that no I mean I've never been given that Liberty to charge for an update on a project yeah I'm getting paid to do if you put the requirement of these updates in the in then then they would have to factor that into their overall we just want something more formal because I think what's happened with salt marsh over the years is every year a new person's assigned and they all have different styles and they're informally contacting Heather but it's not I'd rather so why don't we change that language to say periodic updates quarterly or as requested by the city manager progress updates yeah the way it's written now is submit progress reports or hold periodic meetings and what I'm suggesting is ADD not less frequently than quarterly and upon reasonable request of the city manager so it's progress reports or hold periodic meetings I can agree to that yes the bills paid at the end or they require periodic payments periodic payments well there you go that's your leverage exactly periodic payments through the year or once they start the work once they start the work yeah they voice well and there's a difference if they have to provide documentation to you with numbers and hey it's going good I mean there's there's a difference you know so there's also a difference if they call meeting with myself versus just calling up Heather um I prefer that you know they can communicate with Heather but I prefer like a a formal meeting yeah periodically yeah with status I agree and it should be at your discretion not theirs unless they have an issue and they'll take it up with Heather first and you'll end up with you but you should be able to feel comfortable asking them for periodic up good that in I tell you what I'm learning a lot just from this little bit of conversation this organization vsso I'm leading head of I'm still waiting for the 20 fiscal year 20 and 21 audits would they haven't even started the 23 oh my heavens and I'm I'm ready to put the finance officer in a guillotine yeah yeah my question would be what's what's going on yeah and so it's been a fun year where there's smoke there's fire yeah can I ask I'm sorry I know I'm new but I'm just yeah so on the like I know salt marsh is no longer we're not working with them anymore right wrapping up the audit and we're going to we're going to request them to bid okay so why are they changing people every year because I it just seems to me that like if they get to know what's going on so has the partner changed or just the the accting who's ass signs change this year it's um Amanda who's in uh Texas so she's working remotely but is she the partner or is she just the person doing the work person doing the work and that's not unusual that's it isn't so you can't request to have the same person so you have some continuity it's um so a little color on the accounting world it's been totally crazy uh since Co and so you got firms U all over the country recruiting individuals all over the country and so it's uh highly likely that you work for a firm out of Seattle and you work and you live in Florida so it's it's just it it is probably one of the biggest shortages of jobs uh is an accountant and so it's it doesn't shock me that the the number cruncher changes every year but the partner doesn't change okay so there's still the same partner involved uh traditionally unless now we're going to request for a 30 days notice of a changing partner so the partner's always involved but they don't normally show up till the end and then they deliver the but the part we would hold the partner responsible if the person that doesn't perform so we we have a throat to choke so to speak but got uh the people that do the work throat to choke I mean they it changes like you know it's almost the same thing in the medical profession you have a different nurse or a different receptionist or something every time you go in it's just the world today okay so you have to you have to be a little flexible but you have to know who to hold accountable for sure you want to share what's got on with the other cities uh so with the RFP which is uh Readington Shores um when they went out um low bid came in at she say 30 30,000 roughly and um salt marsh who bid on that bid upwards of 60 they were the incumbent yeah so but I mean that high they didn't want the work they didn't want it they're just saying thank you but no thank our fee is what 24 are 25 well currently we lower cuz I think our pre it started our contract was like 15 and it bumped way up closer to 20 but now we're budgeting more close to 30 and then the way that contract is written is that um there there's a price for the standard city audit but if there's any other kind of special audits that need to be done there's another fee so special audits are like when we got the uh the co money from the federal government and how that money is spent then there's separate audit has to be done for that so there can be separate audits done for Grants really tight grants that we're you government grants that we are given correct next part that's something that is written in the grant saying requ you will a yeah yeah okay couple typos one two 3 fourth bullet point on page six uh with any changes in reporting requirements remain I guess to remain in Conformity so we missing two um [Applause] on page 11 and appendix one I just the formatting is kind of wacky in there in terms of the coverage amounts it's in several lines sure y it does we took that from the contract yeah um on page 10 uh item number 10 these are the proposal requirements uh just a simple addition I would suggest that it read that they'll be required to execute an agreement with the city in substantially the form set forth in appendix 2 so if there are any further changes or negotiations you know that's that's a possibility so require their execu an agreement you said in substance in stantially the form set forth okay um we have not yet talked about the contract but I do want to note that the contract makes a reference to a project schedule which is part of the RFP and the RFP does not have a project schedule that I see it has uh some discussion about the The Proposal process but not the actual work progress we had a a little bit defined with the dates of the drafts but not a so that might help address some of the concerns that you had before so maybe build in like a um progress meetings into the schedule yeah and what and what p portion of the work needs to be completed along the way okay you know it's going to start at certain time I don't know I I don't know what the technical part is but work papers get gathered and produced and things start happening so maybe the finance person can help put something like that together is there any further discussion about the RFP itself okay what about Ohad so I just wanted to go over one of the responsibilities of the audit selection committee is um defining the evaluation criteria because you guys will actually be reviewing the proposals and then ranking the firms so if we go [Applause] to page the overview of the scoring is on page four or 14 we have four categories we have qualifications experience expertise for maximum possible points of 45 we got audit approach ability to furnish for 30 uh references 15 and then cost proposals 10 and if you go down to page starting on page 8 of 14 it says response elements and it talks about putting together the proposal and when you get to number four that's where it lists out bullet points and uh descriptions of what the uh what what we're looking for as far as scoring and then I also provided a shoot that's been used in the past that kind of asks questions and brings up points when when doing the scoring talks about um you know different things with the approach um you know the cost proposal it talks about why the pricing might be different um just just items to consider when ranking so I just wanted to give you that and if there's anything else you think that we should be listing in these uh um evaluation criteria that that we want to we want them to include our information in their proposal that we'll be looking for um does the RFP specifically State without any ambiguity what needs to be met and how it needs to be handled or is there some leverage or latitude for um doing things in different ways the approach there is there is latitude um and it it's changed over the years with salt marsh mhm um the original um woman who used to come in she used to spend all her time here for weeks you know physically going through things and now it's turned into remote where we're pulling files and submitting records so we're just sending it electronically to them to peruse yes do they do a physical audit at all do they actually come and not in the past few years it's more and more difficult that's interesting so so opinion anyway isn't it you could be feeding documents that aren't is correct AR the actual just an opinion based on what was provided to us well if that's what Heather did yeah that's how they word it and then they say we're not responsible exactly so it's it's their way out anyway regardless of what they do it's still on us to provide them with accurate information to the best of our ability right but if we're not doing something right I want the auditor to tell us you know then not could just blow by I mean that's the whole purpose of it to ensure that we are representing you know the best interest of the citizens yes that's a great point I mean I'm almost thinking like you know they like when you had your company I mean yeah lot of manager normally sits with the owner and the CFO absolutely and has I mean know wonder if they need to hold a meeting with the mayor and the manager yeah we had before it goes to city council just kind of when they do their management review letter I don't I don't know if that's a standard practice or not uh they did reach out via email and they called me and asked me about any concerns and did the same for Heather and they did their um IAL I do a conflict Check City Council Members yeah and you have to also say you know if you have any interest you know you got to check the boxes did that for all the employees that deal with the budget expenditures I think it's important to agree that we need to audit the audit so as the auditing committee I think that um truly upon us to say to audit the audit but to what extent yes so it's a fine line you know you you you want to be able to trust what they deliver to you to be representative of what you gave them but there's not a chance in the world that we're going to be able to spot every single thing I mean I think we did an amazing job of finding what we all found last year that we brought back to them that either we had given them something incorrectly or they had interpreted it incorrectly but at the end of the day it's still the city's responsibility to make sure that um what was given was reported on accurately and fairly because as you said there's a you know disclosure on the bottom of it that this is an opinion based on what was furnished to us and this this year um Heather sent them all the QuickBook pretty much the whole F all the files so they could open it up and go through that's good find the documents yeah yeah and whatever they could they sent to them and they but they're responsible for tying back every single entry to every single cost in every single category M and they should be able to do that without hesitation I don't I I guess that goes with standard Gap PR practices so do we need I guess the question was do we need to put anything in the RFP that speaks to that I don't know I don't think so or anything additional well that's a great thought but I think they state that they're presenting it according to Gap and government excepted accounting principles hand on what you gave them no they area so I don't know if there's anything higher or greater I've never had experience in dealing with anything other than Meeting those standards so well I guess the the next step is when we get the um Goa um accounting certification because they kind of take a deeper dive and ask for um make amendments based on the recommendations and we've always gotten good remarks good reports there yeah and we've taken those U recommendations and corrected them in the time right and that's part of the reason we built that that draft in sub early in February cuz we're trying to meet their deadline yeah there you go yeah cuz last year last year or way later way late yeah and they don't they'll give you extensions but they want specific reasons and they don't like the same reason over and over again right they're getting stract to what St so when when they say well the IRS extended due to hurricanes don't we get an extension hurricanes so that works one year I can just tell you with uh the companies I work with getting output from the CPA firms is horrendous right now horrendous not the quality the tiing well I think they're all all struggling from lack of resources yeah so this is what we once the RPS come back then we'll be given the grade sheets we grade according to this and you guys are satisfied with the dates I got it going out uh this Friday once we Mak some changes and then the deadline coming in is May 31st how many recipients are on the list I'm going to put on demand star um and then submit it if they're not or they should be listed but I'll double check everyone that Heather knows in the area make sure good number of people will receive it I hope so yeah I I can give you a number once I put it in of what that that group entails cuz you know depending on what you're posting on demand start SS it to specific people who register so I have one question about the evaluation process and just posing to the group does does that feel right does that feel good to you that references are u a maximum of 15 points and cost is the lowest Factor well it it do you want quality or do you want price consideration I I think that's the question but so you marry all of those things together and sure when we decide it's we've taken all those things into consideration but references I tend to Discount a little bit and not because I don't um want them uh it's just that no one's going to send you a bad reference that anybody can find somebody that'll say yeah I I like this person they do good work but that's why Mark is a neighbor but you you're right and I but I think it behooves us to make sure that we go out to the people in charge at the other cities that we've were given as references to sort of dig into it if we ask the right questions you you usually can tell if you're getting an honest valuation or if they're you know yeah they were good so what important salt marsh is probably the go-to municipal firm in the State of Florida wow so I think part of the problem is that they're that big now and they know that and so from their you know they may just want to do the cities of Tampa Largo and clear water because they don't have the bandwidth for $25,000 a year for us it's they'd rather charge $250 to 500 to one of these bigger cities so I think um Heather's got a great insight and I think we'll make sure we get in front of the right firms that have the right expertise and it was interesting to hear you know the low price firm for Readington was a local penel firm if I remember right what she said so you know I think to your point we get what we pay for yeah but but you never know either who's who's got the bandwidth and who doesn't have the band but it will be see the list of cities and Municipal customers that they represent CU we really could care less if they do a for 500 and how long they've had them yeah which is usually sometimes it's not furnished these are the people we audit I don't have a problem with the total possible points for the proposed fee I think it's clear that um the sentence the cost should be evaluated in conjunction with the other categories but only after which is underlined the other points are awarded I don't know who came up with the scale or the total number of points and I'm not trying to Discount the importance of um factoring the fee but I don't have a problem with the fact that it says that when you do after all other categories value yeah score because it's you to your point yeah you don't want to give you don't want to give it to the company that doesn't do very well in the other categories but they're the low ball well that CH you know you can can manipulate the numbers in the other three categories to whatever you want it to be for a maximum but you're still going to have that ratio if you will mhm when you get down to the proposed fee so the key is take that into consideration when you're doing the other three evaluations But ultimately your final decision about is after the first threee so it's out of 100 yeah um so you're comparing like how much the value you get it seems reasonable that the the the proposed fee is something that's always negotiable anyway yeah so you should meet 90% of your criteria and then go after um the negotiating the fee right that way you get in quality product not just the lowest cost product that sounds good do you have anything more to add to your discussion before we look at the contract no we covered it yeah just wanted the Insight on the uh evaluation talk about the dates make sure our timetable is correct so you mentioned the return on the 31st then when do you want to get them to us and then how long for us have you scheduled that out how long we get to evaluate it that's left up in the air um I figured once I send you everything couple weeks it's sort of an unknown is how many responses we're going to get yeah and it does say if we if we don't get three then we just rank what we got because we have to rank at least the top three that's the state statute yes that was in the statute when do you have to take it to the council and say Here's the recommendation uh before the end of the fiscal year so that we have the uh approval September 1st at the latest there's a lot of time June September so August August probably would be a good one that way it's not right on the last minute but worst case September and we're going to be working with budget at the same time right we get from more we might be tag te team in some meetings together for Budget at RFP response yeah because I mean we get some numbers late right before after the first do the first draft and then and then we just plug them in so we'd be fine with that so what additional comments might anyone have regarding the contract itself I have a few comments page P two at the top on Item B is where it references the project schedule in the RFP just be aware of that we're going to come up with one and we're going to elaborate um and a question for you is is this generally a fixed fee or is it hourly how is it generally priced so it's an annual fee is what it's historically been and it's a multi-year contract and then there's a uh cost of living adjustment for like 3 years I think is what the current contract is it was a threeyear contract with an escalator for each year um on page three uh item 4 B uh it says that um invoices will be sub submitted in sufficient detail I assume that those will be just quarterly payments or installment whatever whatever is agreed upon um and specify the services performed and the time spent on such work um how do you feel about adding an increments of onet of an hour so that you actually know how much time because I've seen bills I've seen bills where they just have some ungodly amount and they build an hour yeah they've got ungodly amount of time and they that change anything I mean if weat because we're we're set at a state an annual fee all right but I agree if we were being build by the hour yeah but and they could we could ask them we don't know at this point for something extra something special something to do that's not covered in the standard audit and they could say yeah our all rate is this we're estimating it to be 20 hours or whatever and there's a good chance that whatever F we pick is going to try to negotiate that so we'll all get a chance to see it again that's right exactly uh on page four item 12 um on dispute resolution I think the um capitalized terms are reversed so all claims arising out of this Capital agreement or its agreement which is would be lower case if you see it that way I'll leave that to the attorneys yeah I'll bring it up to Rob yeah cuz if you go to page one um this agreement is capitalized so we have this one uh or have been what would they mean we don't know they wouldn't say agreement twice without specify this agreement or its agreement or it's brief Bri just ask to check it I thought I read that earlier and and it made sense now I question it okay yeah so let's just bring that up to that okay um on the bottom of that page I on bottom of page four uh records retention 3 years seems kind of short I mean generally for even tax purposes you keep records for at least 6 years so I would put that to maybe there a question is three years sufficient I'm sorry I don't see p what second you went uh bottom of page four the agreement yeah the last line not the RFP but the agreement what is they referring to which which data uh it's um that they'll maintain records to justify all payments made by the city for at least 3 years after completion stat Li Most states it's 10 is that our responsibility their responsibility to keep we give them yeah yeah put them in a box and and justify cloud or whatever but so they're going to charge for that well it says but it's longer pult maintain the record so it's got that Clause if by or longer if required the top of page five so that yeah but the problem with them would be on us the burden would be on us to say that it should be longer right if they don't keep them so I agre I agree Kev that ought to be a specified time more than 3 years 3 years is pretty short yeah do we know what the federal or state law is it depends on for what purpose yeah if it's for for personnel purposes one thing it's tax purposes clk's got a whole description environmental violations what record is and it tells you to retain so I could have her look and see if it matches up and the last comment I had is on liquidated damages which is section 35 the last section uh liquidated damage is run at a penalty of $100 a day that's low I added that cuz we had nothing from previously and from what uh attorney e Felder was telling me it's it's a tough thing to to to argue to to make them responsible for but he thought it didn't it didn't hurt to have something in there um it holds their commitment to February 15 yeah I try to hold them to something um even though the burden of proof is on us to prove the actual amount of damage and he was saying he was showing me a bunch of cases and saying um in most cases it won't even be worth going after but I was like so maybe we just shouldn't have and he's like it won't hurt to have it in there so that was the final way no I think it's I think it's a great thing to have I was just wondering if it was low 100 100 bucks a day do we know if any other cities had this section 35 liquidated damages in their contracts well the sample contract didn't have it and I asked for something I that's how he discussed it and I I just put a 100 because I didn't want hather was concern that putting too high might alarm the firm and yeah they do not like that I just want that something that was reasonable not B I'm thinking the same thing you know you get too exorbitant and they're going to say you know what wor worst case they're going to take actually to throw it out but I think I think it's in there for a first pass we see what it takes yeah and just like you said you probably spend more money trying to collect it than what they would owe you and then again give me an example of what that would be yeah would it would have to be something that refurnish them correctly they interpreted it incorrectly that caused us harm monetary harm like if we were finded or something yeah maybe we don't get our GF because they didn't turn it around quick enough well that that could be yes non for performance yeah but again we'd have to proove the actual cost the amount show that yeah so it's a I mean you got to enter into the the contract with some level of comfort that you're working together as partners I think in one scenario we just discuss would be like if they just fell through and we felt it was pertinent that we hired another firm to get it all done and took that and that's a very valid thought because if they throw up their hands say we can't like we lost all of our help we can't do this and now the another firm we have to hire is going to charge us twice as much because they've only got a shrunken period in which to produce it um okay how's that how does that get handled is the question and $100 a day isn't even going to come close to the um to the charges that we're going to be paying by somebody to expedite the audit yeah it's not even a fifth of an hourly bill for most most of them so so bar you pardon yeah ahead are you reading this as a preclusion to other damages when you say liquidated that's it well well I yeah I was saying what specifically would be liquidated as to nonperformance so is it does it speak to anything about non-performance it says if if they fail to deliver any final draft interim report audit or other deliverable required by this agreement I don't know I think I might take that take that back to the attorney we certainly don't want it to be the measure of all damages no um the biggest one that I would be concerned with is re yeah yeah re you're right if they just decided to quit and walk away from it and it's like oh well so it's you know so it's 700 bucks so what force all our okay ask I would hope they have insurance for these kinds of things we have a requirement for well it's more like yeah more that was another thing that the limit is a million dollars is that standard in Florida for any kind of Professional Service even engineering firms that's all we have yeah except for technology companies oh five really wow or more they try to get 10 wow cyber security it's fin all the comments I had anybody else have any further comment Kyle do you have something now I'm going to take all your comments and try to get this turned around hopefully if I can't get an answer back from uh attorney as father in time I might have to just push to like Monday or something but that would be a change on the issue date I think May 31st would still be fine even if you were a week out yeah okay that's it so with the changes we talked about discussed I'll motion approval of the RFP we have a motion do we have a second second second very well all in favor any opposed motion carries uh final agenda item do we have any new or general business I don't there being none do we have a motion to adjourn very good we have a motion is all in favor I I any opposed it being 603 a very nice one hour"
