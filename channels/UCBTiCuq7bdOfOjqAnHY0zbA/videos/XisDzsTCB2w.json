    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is now 6 p.m on august 15th this is the bel air beach city council work session uh we're bringing it to order everyone please rise one nation under god indivisible with liberty council member frank banker council member leslie otero councilmember lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley your council member mike sable your vice mayor glenn gunn your mayor dave gattis your interim city manager kyle wiefler city attorney randy mora president thank you patty we have a list of agenda items it's it's a pretty big list there's a couple of things that i want to take care of first so we're going to do this slightly out of order one of them was just to discuss support of resolution for the psfrd and they are here tonight i don't think we're going to be able to do that resolution and i'm going to go to the city attorney to explain why and then while they're here we'll we'll let them take any questions we may have thank you mr mayor while it's admittedly an open legal question as to whether the council could adopt the resolution i would advise against doing so historically there's been a statute 106 third 113 that concerns electioneering in the last legislative session that was amended by the florida legislature and in those amendments it now provides that a local government or a person acting on behalf of local government may not expend or authorize the expenditure of public funds for a political advertisement or any other communication sent to electors concerning the referendum issue in short regardless of whether it presents facts only that the term communication is not defined in that statute authorized expenditure is not defined in that statute with that in mind it presents a open legal question as to whether or not you could and i would advise against being the test case in this recently adopted florida statutory restriction so that's and i and i did have the opportunity to discuss this with the mayor last week in connection with similar advice he ordered in the um one of the flc conference presentation materials and that aligned with my instincts and my inclination so with that that's my advice would be against adopting the resolution that is not in any way reflective of a position by on my part without this proposed resolution or the or the request made or that of the commission but rather trying to abide by the mandates of the legislation thank you very much so we have the fire chief here please come up to the podium and uh give us your names in your title and then uh we'll give you a few minutes and then we'll take questions thank you mayor randy we understand your position this is brand new legislature and we certainly wouldn't tell you how to do your job we understand um where you're at and that so i wouldn't try to talk you out of it but what i would like to do is say thank you for having me here and allow me just take a couple minutes of your time to explain what uh issue that we have if that's all right i'll be as brief as possible so i wish that you presented at the last meeting to explain to you that we had a funding issue from the suncoast fire rescue district that needed a permanent solution and because we have a flat rate assessment that does not increase with our expenses the district is projected to run out of money in 2025. before i go further i'm very rude but this is our finance director erin brooks she's our expert and i'm so sorry i introduced me right away but the district is protected around money in 2025 and without additional funding as our reserve levels get a little bit lower the state's going to step in and eventually trigger a takeover and the district will likely dissolve so last month our fire commission voted to place a very important question on the november 8th ballot you can find all the information you see the slide up here you can email info at psfrd.org you can call that phone number or you can look on our website it's psfrd.org referendum and there's a lot of information there has the actual ballot question exactly what we're asking for i didn't bring it tonight because i we don't have it back yet in spanish translation which is required so i didn't want to bring it here tonight but you can see it on the website in both english and spanish but basically we're going to the voters asking for a .67 millage rate that cannot be increased as to 0.67 military aaron and i worked very hard we did a 20-year projection on all the things that we absolutely must have to survive and that includes firefighters and fire stations and capital equipment such as fire trucks and protective equipment paramedics and training we didn't put any of our desires we only put in the things that we absolutely need to come up with the lowest number and that's like 0.67 military now i can't tell you what you would be charged if we weren't here but if your adjacent areas are charging 2.61 mils and 2.91 mils for the other fire departments that are surrounding your city so that comes out with even with our flat rate and the 0.67 comes out to double or triple the amount that you would pay if we weren't here and you're not going to advertise the fire chief you get you have your own fire department with us and you'll get a person you do get personal service from the here that's online and not here is our sound just i want to make sure they can hear what you're saying oh my cards and errands cards on the table back there i want everybody to be able to access this information so at the end when i'm done if anybody will be here if anybody has any questions um so that's what we're asking for to go to the voters and i told you what the surrounding areas are charging equates to double or triple and the average increase for your city in bel air beach based on 22 2022 values the average additional cost for residential properties is 337.21 so any questions that i could answer thank you for having me i know we had a few questions uh last time commissioner asked me about looking at just a flat rate we're just a millage and aaron had determined that simply doing a flat rate for the entire district would be 810 per household and simply doing it military would be a 1.72 military for five years without being able to ever lower it so we would have to do a minimum of a 1.72 for five years so we're asking just for a .67 military that cannot be increased i'm happy to present to anyone at any time show you our 20-year projection all the things we'll be doing with the funds and explain to you what will happen if we do not get them uh just a couple quick questions with respect to your responses what's the split between say responding to structural fires in this area versus uh ems response i mean when's the last time we had a structural fire together which i don't know well typically our fire rated rated responses are um 20 are fire related and 80 or ems related and that's pretty much standard in florida for ems space now that's because a lot of good things right we have better building codes we have fire inspection we have fire prevention and education different uh construction nowadays than they did in the past and we have things such as fire alarms and sprinkler systems things like that so it's 80 percent generally is ems related and 20 is fire related but we do the pinellas coast fire message district we do provide the fire and dms service to bel air beach so we just don't do the transporting so our fire department has a fire on every apparatus has paramedics and emts when you have a medical call they're first on scene to treat stabilize and sometimes transport but most for the most part sunstar he made his contract with the county and they didn't transport there are times when the fire department doesn't transport them so so do you have any miller beach specifically i can give you exactly how many calls we've run into belarus absolutely i appreciate that and then the second question i have is the ad valorem that you're advocating is that in place of the existing flat rate or is that on top of the plant no that that is including the flat rate would stay the 360 dollars would stay and see if we did away with that that's where the military would have to be a 1.72 okay so you can have the lord on top of the fact yes sir yes sir thank you other council yeah specifically um so what what tools or methods are you guys able to use and are using to help educate the public that are covered by you guys so they'll understand things like if they don't approve this because what i'm concerned about a lot of people say oh my gosh another ad valorem tax and they just automatically vote no without the understanding that the alternative may be you guys go out of business and then what happened the state comes in and then there's not a vote on that right they just say that states you know yes sir and this is going to be your admiral tax yes sir so what type of tools or information you guys have to help educate the people that are going to be voting on this okay that's a great question so there are a lot of things we're doing with public education and being out in the community and meetings with the same house bill that passed there's a lot of restrictions between special districts especially with the expenditures of any funds with that there's the only thing that we can do as a district is educate to the facts now the fire department has a union right which is totally separate and they can do different things they have a political action committee where they are spending money they are educating creating some flyers and billboards and mailers things like that we're from the district we are putting on our website as well as they'll be available for any meetings uh they fact sheet that tell you exactly uh what will happen what we're doing with the money what the bout language is what will happen if we're not here and i it is my intention to meet with anyone and everyone to educate them because they don't know some people think that you know we have an avalor or this passed many years ago or whatever they might think and we are the only municipality in the entire county that does not have an aberdorm tax and that's the way our charter has been written we have to go to the voters for that but i will tell you and aaron feel free to any time is uh you know aaron has done a deep dive we both started here in november aaron was in the company that was the auditing company for the district for many years she knows the finances in and out and when we did a deep dive as to what the district needs we realize that the district will be out of money in september of 2025. and again you know your surrounding areas are charging 2.6163 mils and 2.9132 mils so even with the 360 flat fee it's still one half or one third of those what those rates would be proposal includes moving the fire house from irb or location correct the proposal includes rebuilding one of our stations 27 that's in irb and we have done a study and we would like to move that station further north to have better we have good response times in the bell air base but we'd like to have we they can be improved and so our issue is finding property right and we have located some property that we're in talks with however we can't commit to that because until the ballot passes and we have the actual funding come in but we are looking at the very northern end of indian rocks beach would that would put them at the southern end of bel air beach and drastically improve the response times here how do you know this funding would suffice them how do you know that the funding that you're proposing for the increase in facebook new building we've done projections worked with architects and looked at the building costs of what's being built around us there's a few other fire stations that are being built and we did the estimates and left some room there for inflation we also are working with the county on some funding and pursuing grants and things like that so we're confident so if you took out you just left the things the way they are how much how much would you truly need because that's that's in my view that's going to be a massive amount of money we will even if we didn't relocate that that station is in drastic need of being rebuilt the stations from 1965 very unhealthy fire station um it's not um healthy for the firefighters to live there there's a lot of standards like for example it's a three-story building and we don't have an elevator it's not ada compliant we can't hold public meetings there is putting the district at a liability that someone can't come upstairs to speak to the fire chief so that's one of the things that that building even if we stayed at the property that we have that building needs to be demolished and rebuilt might say one uh is there any land available you keep talking about we're going to build this we're going to build that i don't see much available land and number two what happens is the voters decide we're not going to pay another tax or you know add to our taxes what happens if the vote it is up to voters and if the voters decide that's not the majority decide that's not what they want we will be dissolved uh pinellas suncoast fire rescue district will no longer exist and the state will come in there'll be a state takeover more than likely you'll be contracted with your neighboring fire department i mean i hear that but what does that really mean i mean will our response times drop um i i would say i can't answer for them but i would say that with certainty that the millis rates that they're charging now the the 2.91 and the 2.61 that's when they can contract services to to other areas with their existing fire stations and their existing personnel so if they were to do a study and say oh we need a fire station in bel air beach or in iraq's beach you're not going to pay that military because they also have to now pay for a fire station and they have to pay for at least nine firefighters to be housed in that fire station so until you'd be paying for that until those costs are absorbed as well so and as far as the land goes um you're right that's one of our biggest problems here the pieces are built out and we're working diligently with many different avenues and we do have a piece of property identified on the northern end however we can't commit to that until after november so you're telling us that it's going to be more expensive for us if the voters turn this down yes sir at least twice as much and we'll be able to tell any voter we can tell we have an interact interactive spreadsheet from the property appraiser i can pull up your address and i can tell you exactly to the dollar amount what you would pay and for anybody and we're happy to do that because we want everybody to be educated you know we're we're telling everyone the facts you know these are not my opinion dessert hacks so i'm happy to do that i'd like to meet with anybody that would like to know that and this is your fire department you have input on everything that we do has there ever been a case of pinellas shuttering a fire house have you ever had a layoff or a prologue yes sir yes sir back in 2009 the ems funding that everybody pays 0.9156 mills every resident pays 0.9156 mills to the county for ems funding back in 2008 we we had three fire stations as we had now and we were getting paid for three seats of funding which is typical in the county and that was cut down to one seat in the county so we couldn't not provide that service right so the district absorbed those costs they gave the employees a year to find other jobs and we laid off six people closed down one fire station temporary closed down a second fire station and then it was realized that there's a huge gap in service and the fire stations were reopened however our funding was not brought up to the minimum levels we've been working diligently very hard mayor goddess has been a proponent on the mcat committee as well and we believe that this october will have that that funding back which is going to help us it doesn't solve our problems but it definitely can help us as it's an additional 300 000 per year so that's what would happen before 2025 before we're totally out of money is there would be a reduction in personnel and a reduction in service more than likely another agency would have to provide those services but we'd be at the mercy of the state as to what happens next and you know this fire department started here in 1951 and i'll tell you i have 44 families that depend on this job and i have families that have had their dad's work here their relatives their uncles their grandfathers work here one of our union president his dad died in the line of duty serving in iraq's speech in bellaire beach and he's trying to carry that on nobody wants to work in a place that they don't have safety and security for their family if this doesn't pass in november firefighters are going to start to look going other places and we're not going to be able to fill their positions nobody's going to nobody no no one qualified is going to be able to fill those positions and it's going to get bad and services will go down thank you thank you any other questions from the council i'm gonna uh since you're here and we have a few citizens here are there any questions from the citizens for chief davidson yes please come up to the podium and john hansen 22nd street it's not a question it's a piece of information depending on the rating of the fire service is contingent on your homeowners insurance premiums so if the suncoast goes away and we wind up being contracted out and response time is lengthened insurance companies get this information and we will end up paying more premiums so that's something to mull over going forward but i'm not for wanting to pay more taxes i put out too many fires to see i know what they go through i would support it thank you thank you very much uh bear in mind that this is not something we're voting on as a council this is something that's going to appear on your ballot later and uh that we're not supporting one way or the other as a council but as in as individuals we all can speak our own minds so any other comments or questions from the citizens no thank you very much chief davis and i appreciate it thank you well for your time in the morning welcome to we're happy to come back anytime you welcome me and i did leave mine and aaron's business cards on the back uh if anybody'd like to contact us thank you very much for your time appreciate you and thank you vice mayor i'll get that information for you right away thank you thank you okay we do have another hot topic which is the uh the buoy situation i would like to take care of this one um next and then we'll take the rest of the topics in order so um i have three discussion of the gulf of mexico safety zone city attorney maura you did some research on this would you like to take the forward please happily mr marin thank you for the opportunity council to speak with you on this over the last two weeks you've received some correspondence from me concerning the what is alternatively described as the safety zone issue the buoy issue the fwc issue choose your moniker the result is the same in this and kyle's working in the background to make sure that a guest can hear us on this but i'll speak to that in a moment in my correspondence i provided you sort of a factual timeline as to how we ended up here from a proposed ordinance standpoint on july 5th there was a proposed ordinance that was failed for lack of motion at our last meeting on august 1st we had an ordinance that provided an alternative approach whereby the safety zone as it's been called would be eliminated and the buoys pulled that was tabled to a later time and based on its tabling this workshop issue arose at the conclusion of that discussion i committed to you that i would reach out to a peer a fellow attorney in the office of nfwc's offices concerning this to see if they could make themselves available we had some very fruitful and substantive discussions on on the issue and ms brandy elliott should be on the line i believe she's right there in 4k for all of us to see on the screen but miss elliott will be joining us miss elliot and i first got acquainted formally last month when we both presented at the florida municipal attorneys association she on various fwc issues ion pedestrians and multi-multi-global transportation uh be that as it may her office and that of the office of the city attorney both through me and my predecessors exchanged a great deal of correspondence with fwc in the last year as this issue has come to pass the issue that you have here is an ordinance rather a permit that was functionally issued in error um from fwc's perspective it's an an understanding that people may disagree on that i want to be very clear that my job is to provide you information i'm not trying to debate you i'm not trying to persuade you i just want you to have information and you folks that these policy makers can reach your home for solutions and so with that in mind uh the the regulatory landscape on this comes from florida statute 327.46 it provides in two different places one b sub 3a our ability to make an ordinance designating a public bathing beach swim area this is what you would call the safeties of what you historically called as a safety zone but what it provides that is a vessel exclusion zone it's not a vessel under a certain speed it's just swimmers to the exclusion of vessels a second alternative you have under this under um sorry two uh sub three is to or sorry c sub two is two c sub three is to create a vessel exclusion zone for vessels under poor or manpower or sail um and in order to do that the first one the vessel exclusion zone altogether you have your discretion as legislators to just establish that if you're going to do a vessel exclusion zone for power under or or or sail you have to provide competent substantial evidence that threshold candidly is fairly low but you have to have some evidence of the uses in your community and justifications from as a policy maker for reaching that and fwc evaluates that the third option is to not regulate it at all and then your fourth option is some combination thereof much in the same way that the july 4 4 rather july 5th ordinance had proposed the there is an ability as you see if you were to look to 3 27 46 you would see language about ordinances establishing a slow speed minimum wage a numerical speed limit the the conditions for that are that it'd be within 300 feet of a confluence of water bodies presenting a blind corner we don't have that in the open gulf alternatively that if that area is subject to unsafe levels of vessel traffic congestion that is a higher showing than we do have boats here all of florida's coastline has boat traffic to show that that is a that you're subject to unsafe levels of vessel traffic would likely be a higher showing the second is that it is subject to hazardous water levels or currents or containing other navigational hazards again general environmental factors like riptide exist throughout florida's beaches simply the fact that we have observed riptide or strong currents in our beaches and beach ways we likely would not get you there from certainly from an fwc perspective and also an area that actually reports uniform boating citations vessel traffic studies or other credible data demonstrate to present a significant risk of collision or significant threats to voting safety and again we have no such uh documented evidence thus far on that issue understanding that um [Music] low-wage buoys have been present historically so that's a little bit of the landscape from a regulatory standpoint again this body considered ordinances 2202 and 2203 and so and and i circulated additional materials one of the other bases for alternative buoy arrangements is if there is a docker loading facility and i presented a decision the department of administrator or division of administrative hearings to you and my materials that sort where they where fwc was actually attempting a fairly liberal interpretation of what a dock or loading facility was and the division of administrative hearings said no that that was in doing that it was an unlawful uh delegation of the legislative power basically they were reading too liberally and that was not according to the division of administrative hearings this is i understand a sensitive issue for some in the community a passionate issue for some i want to be very clear as i am in all my communities i am not a policy maker the seven of you are i'm here to provide you uh information and resources and to that end miss elliott is also available on the line miss elliott will not be making a presentation she is here as a resource to us to provide either fwc's perspective on the matter or answer your other questions about uh vessel safety as it relates to fwc policies um and if miss elliott if i mischaracterized uh that in any way or failed to add sufficient caveat please let me know okay she's shaking her head so we're good all right so so with that mayor i would tender it back to you of course i am available and miss elliot are available uh is available for your questions and i ask that we just um you know keep the conversation thank you very much we're going to start discussion with the council eventually we will take citizen comments and then we'll come back to the council citizens bear in mind that this is not a back and forth conversation your comments are welcome but they're just comments for us to consider and um uh just so that we could keep the conversation flowing and uh and come closer to making a decision at the next regular council meeting we will not be voting on anything tonight we're just having a discussion with that being said any questions comments from the council banker well going over what mr moore said um i can't understand how a permit is issued in error when biller beach contacted fwc september 19. fwc requested what bourbon to appeal to buildings three times between september 19 and may of 2020 best providing idle speed no weight in each email that i have okay right here just or everybody knows me as well so i can't understand how that's an error plus the permit needs to be renewed every three years 320 746 went into effect what was voted on by legislative 2009 went into effect in 2010. how do you keep airing something i was not involved in those i can't i can't explain to you why that would happen i can tell you um none of us i think are terribly surprised or unfamiliar with the concept of administrative failures and oversights and i'm not suggesting to you that everything here was done by the book i was not involved in that process nor am i judging or commenting on the performance of fwc personnel but how permits get issued in error all the time in local government fence is permitted to be 10 feet tall it should have been seven feet tall a building is allowed to exceed a certain height or setback limit that shouldn't have been upon further review generally speaking within the law as just a matter of law a permanent issue and error is a permanent void of an issue it's generally deployed from its inception because they the oversights or failures of individual administrators cannot supersede the law so i i i'm sympathetic to and understand the point you're making and again i'm not debating you i just want to make clear that i i hear what you're saying there's a whole pattern of failure in that process for somebody to catch something that they are asserting should have been addressed long ago well the other thing is if if we are in violation okay i think we've had computers for a couple years now how many permits has fwc approved that have idle speed no weight and towns and cities in the state of florida east west and north of this state there's a simple word search for grant us that we can go right down the street and find some all right and fwc has not addressed any evidence now my argument has been fwc isn't competent in doing their permits you represent irb they actually requested irb to send them a picture of their permits rather than getting off their ways and butts and going out with one of their patrol boats and examining the buildings themselves but going back to 327.46 while you read what we can and cannot do with idle speak permits it also says in order to establish an idle speed no wake voting restriction area if the area is this is one and this is a within 500 feet of any boat ramp voice marine railway or other launching or landing facilities or other launching or landing facilities we've had a landing facility from 19th street to harrison avenue longer than i've been here i've been here eight years it's probably been established at least 20 years when that permit 01-020 went into effect so we've established a landing facility for two decades i'd like to see a court tell us that we have to remove a safety markers okay when we had a landing facility for two plus decades and this is my argument that we should be addressing the court i wrote to fwc i've asked them to take this to an administrative law judge which the permit said they arbitrarily denied my request this council has the ability to take them to court get a cease and desist on their actions right now and leave these buoys alone i'd say yeah i'm looking at this and i'll tell you it's i know a lot of voters frankly the people of this you know community are very nice they understand that currently the way it stands you can drive that vote very safely very slowly no way in this area but that's not the only people off the beach we have high-speed vessels and i'll tell you from experience i've driven them professionally you cannot stop them they are people from outside the community they're going at least 40 45 miles an hour you cannot stop one of those vessels and the only thing keeping them out of the swim lanes are frankly the bulls now it's difficult again you know knowing boaters we have you know voters that would like you know have that ability but you really can't pick and choose i tried that with having vessel exclusion areas combined with boating areas and we failed to reach consensus so what i'm recommending what i'll support is replacing the buoys that unfortunately you know we can't have good things because of the acts of you know people outside our community so we'll have to replace the buoys voters will not be able to allow you know coming in those you know you know that'd be preferable i'd like to have what we had before but we can't do that um and you know further you know at least have one the ability to say have a you know paddle paddleboard in that area because you know obviously very slow speed on those and you know keeping that what they call you know the the parasailers the foils those are high speed if you're not familiar with them they have a running skate that's basically a knife that's you know three foot under the water and you really cannot control those so again i know what i'd like to prefer but we can't do it so put the buoys back we're gonna have to go swim exclusion area you know up and down the beach maintain safety for everybody and frankly what we need to do is you know get off top dead center get some consensus in this group and move forward thank you boyd roberts um first i'd like to thank ms elliot for giving up her time today to be here to help us with questions and any information we may need so thank you um i do have a question about the vessel exclusion and i i think i read several things about i think i understand what what that's supposed to mean so we have a vessel exclusion area does that pretty much mean that there would be the definition of vessel would include anything up to including paddle boards kayaks things like that correct yes sir um the the definition of vessel is actually provided in section 327.02 of the statutes and it's a pretty broad definition it's basically all means of transportation upon the water and that's a little broad because there are some things that necessarily by their own definitions don't fall within the definition of vessel there are other things such as floating structures sea planes are specifically exempted out and then things like flutes we kind of follow the federal government because stars lead on um on most things where they designate what qualifies as a vessel or not so long as it meets our state definition so things like floats and rafts and things like that aren't vessels but stand-up powerboards have been determined to be vessels um there's a lot of things new technology things like jet lags and jet propelled vessels those things all qualify as vessels so when you're talking about a vessel exclusion zone um just to straight exclusion zone which was the first option for an alternative restricted area that was discussed it would exclude all types of vessels so floats and rafts and things like that would be allowed to be in there um paddle boards all those jet lags and of course what you think of when you think of a standard powered vessel would also be excluded okay thank you very much um so mike back to you when you were saying that we put the rules back replaced them what were you envisioning regarding what would actually be on the booms what type of notice what would it say what were you hoping you would say i'm just trying to get reviews actually that's not my call that'd be their call because you're very specific when you're talking about bullies they should be marked in a uniform matter throughout uh to comply with something called collision regulations that's coast guard and fwc whatever mandatory they use but what i like i mean preferable again is having a vessel exclusion area and be marked for swimmers but i was seeing if there's a possibility to incorporate to allow obviously you know float floating toys you know bring out your giant inflatable donut power boards and kayaks again all manpower and i'm gonna chime in right away i believe we did have those options we have the options to have minimalistic craft that you can paddle around randy's options he gave us option two was just that under horror sale and that was this original conversation we had we were given three options pick one and that's whenever we had uh an open forum and citizens came out and spoke and we had a few people that wanted to be able to bring their boat in so we tried to reach a compromise and that didn't work out so we're kind of back to where we are with those three choices pick one um it looks like we're going to have to put we're going to have to do something we either pull them completely or we put them back and pick one of the three choices so that's where we're at we definitely need this in my version you know i would find anybody that wants to remove them totally well you wouldn't have to replace them you'd have to put this free board we're missing several already and and the ones that are out there on the water they have taken competing so uh leslie matara special investment i'm sorry leslie can you pull your microphone a little closer is it better my problem with the vessel exclusion zone is if it fires kayaks floats um you know stand-up paddleboards things like that which i have no problem about firing um power and vessels other than human powers do we have that option yes yes so to be clear the second option is generally allowing vessels under power of man or or or sale is the language in the statute the code elaborates that to be basically manpowered things so you would not be able to bring your pontoon boat to shore to pick up your family for a day of beach going but if you wanted to meet your one true love at the shore and go for a sunset paddleboard ride under that regulatory scheme you could do that again the only issue the only issues that's done with with a showing to fwc fwc would have some ability to say hey we do or don't think you've met the threshold to justify that and that's more an explanation of process so that you know it's not just all right we are in agreement if if the consensus of this moves toward number two it's not as simple as a first reading in the second reading there is an added administrative step there in terms of getting fwc approval and it doesn't allow boaters to basically you know anchor outside or just have them you know void or outside the buoys and come in with an inflatable raft come pick up the gear and take it right back out again because basically what 75 yards max out there to the buoy line approximately yeah yeah no depends on the sand which would be nice wouldn't it 300 feet okay so just a couple of things um i i'm originally leaning towards option two but something you said randy was there was there was a the buoys that are there currently are permitable if there's hazardous conditions and i'm speaking of the sand there are many areas where it's ankle deep especially at low tide almost to the buildings so to me that is hazardous conditions if you're in a vessel clearly you want a no weight zone or if you had a boat inclusion area so i'm not sure i kind of missed you kind of glazing over it saying it speaking very quickly and i missed what you were saying but there was um some areas we were talking about hazardous areas and i guess that's how they get away with it that are close to waterways because these movies are all over here so what i was reading from was 327.46 sub 1 sub c sub 2 a through d and so in that in that language there what it says is municipalities and counties have the authority to establish by ordinance the following other voting restricted areas in sub-two is an ordinance establishing a slow-speed minimum wage numerical speed limit and it was subject to those conditions i read a through d i don't know if miss elliott can speak to whether conditions like the ones you just described based on sim level or otherwise have been from fwc's perspective ordinarily qualify or don't or what sort of factors they consider ms elliott is that something you can elucidate at all so let me just generally provide a little more information because i think it'll be helpful um so i would say that you don't have to do the entirety of your jurisdiction or even one stretch of your jurisdiction with only one type of these floating restricted areas so you have the option to create a vessel exclusion zone for a certain stretch and then create a zone where you allow um vessels that are under sailor ore and exclude motorized vessels and then you might have an area that's not regulated at all so the powered vessels can you know essentially go from the shore out to open water and so you're not i just want to be clear these are options that you can use but you can cuddle them together in a way that makes sense to you um it is a very low threshold as um as my colleague was pointing out um there there are two types of voting restricted areas that are permissible by local government in that section that he was talking about chapter 3 27-46 there are a list of specific types of voting restricted areas that local governments can create in subsection 1b and those are areas that can be created by cities and counties without any consultation with swcl and the swim zone option is one that falls under that that category our only role at fwc is you decide to create a swim zone where you exclude everybody except swimmers a vessel exclusion zone our only rule would be to permit your markers to make sure that they are as you mentioned a moment ago and i'm sorry i can't see very well because it's very small but as one of you mentioned a moment ago markers are uniformly created and so our role is to create a permit that make sure the language is consistent the markings are consistent with both the state and federal waters and so we just make sure that you have that ordinance in place and that it's marked appropriately in accordance with that general criteria but there's another whole list of options in 1b we call them one needs they're the types of voting restricted areas that local governments can create unilaterally without consulting with swc the situation however is that there are categories and a lot of them are built based around um types of infrastructure and other things that are presently in your jurisdiction so for instance you heard about one where you could establish a voting restricted area that would control speed around launching and landing facilities that's one example so you have to have a launching and landing facility that meets that definition and then when you have that without consulting with fwc if it's there then you can create a voting restricted area that would be idle speed no way within so many feet of that area so there's a list of acceptable options when they when it's something that falls outside of that they're not permissible there's a section 32760 of the statutes actually says you cannot enforce or continue in effect any ordinance that's in conflict with this chapter so that's why pre-existing statutes are very clearly problematic even if we got them wrong and we did when i say we i mean that's a whole agency i wasn't around 20 years ago and i wasn't consulted a few years ago and i couldn't tell you who was we're recognizing that was an error but we're obligated by the legislature to follow these guidelines and so we're just trying to get it right there is a second subset in chapter 3 27-46 of type of voting restricted areas that a local government can create as well and they have this additional caveat there's specific types so you can't just create any type of zone where fwc would look to see if there's evidence that it's necessary for safety it's specific types of zones and the one that came up that we've talked about this evening so far is a a zone that would exclude all vessels except to those that are operating under sail or war and of course then persons who are not on vessels at all would be implemented as well so um so that's an example where there's this additional layer of review that fwc has to have to review the area and determine that there's evidence that that type of area is necessary to protect public safety based on substantial prominent evidence it's a low threshold for canoes and kayaks and vessels that are under salem ore because because you're not dealing with the safety concerns and the high risks of vessels that are that have motors essentially injuring persons who might be um more disadvantaged so um so there's two categories of voting restricted areas but within those categories are the specific allowable types of voting restricted areas that can be created so it's not just any type of area and i want to be clear that each area that can be created is listed the criteria so it for instance if you have to identify that you have a launching or landing facility and then when you identify that you have that you get so much distance around it and it has to be the specific type of voting restricted area that's identified so it has to be idle speed no wake so the reason i point that out is because earlier it was mentioned that there are a bunch of bible speed no weight markers in the water and there are um there are permissible idle speed no wave zones um all over the state and that's because chapter 3 27 46 does provide for idle speed no 8 zones they just don't provide for them in an unlimited set of circumstances they're the specified the very specific areas that the chapter will allow you to create and so that's why we're limited it's really a legislative enactment where we see we kind of feel like our hands are tied we can we have no say whatsoever when you create a voting restricted area that is under one b which are those that the local government can create without our involvement you then have to permit the signs but we really just make sure that you have the ordinance in place and that it is the type of zone that the statute says can be created and then you have those other ones that are once seen and we have to make sure that there's evidence showing that it's necessary for public safety and then we also have to ferment those markers and so they always know how to follow in this fall within the specific categories that are listed in chapter 3 27-46 if that makes sense thank you very sure i couldn't hear a good portion of what she was saying because it was echoing so i'm not sure that i'm completely clear about maybe some of it yeah miss elliott was functionally restating you know what we've talked about um you know in in in sort of as we say according with providing the accord ii citation saying i agree with this and here's the basis for that my one question is in as much and this is florida lawyer miss elliott in as much as um 327 46 c where there is conditional approval based on certain circumstances sub 2 that includes the slow speed minimum wake there's an a through de conditions do you know if fwc treats those as conjunctive or is it any one of them is sufficient to establish that basis that was not clear to me on the statute i think that might help me inform the answer to the council as to whether that option is viable to them it is any one of them and there's also for your use randy just so you'll have a chapter um it's in 68d and florida administrative code kind of expounds on that the types of evidence that can be presented for a review and so that'll be helpful as well i may have shared that with you but if not if you go the route of a voting restricted area that's under one scene that won't be helpful what did she say what she said was uh the answer to my question was under the two a through d for for low wave there's um four requirements there they are they're disjointed not conjunctive meaning you only need to establish one of them not all four of them by competent substantial evidence the statutes that are articulated for purposes of administrative agencies are often expounded upon in florida's administrative code florida's administrative code is how these get clarified by agencies through the chapter 120 rulemaking process and what she what she was advising me and by extension you is if we go the route of any of the provisions in section c that would require fwc approval that we may wish to look to the florida administrative code as we endeavor to do so as it may provide us some guidance on what is what is what is not viable in our regard so if you're just saying two to two to d or are you saying one through two d you would they were two a through d you need a b c or d not a b c and d okay how about a number one any of those number one is an ordinance establishing an idle speed no wake boating restricted area if the area was in is within 300 feet of a confluence of water bodies presenting a blind corner a bend and narrow channel or fairway or such other area if an intervening obstruction to visibility may obscure other vessels or other users of the waterway i don't think anybody's contending that's the case no i'm talking about one below that one through a b c any of those okay i don't believe we're reading from the same sheet of music because after matters after c1 it goes c2 and 2 has a sub a through d and then you get three a and b and my apologies to the public and my counsel as i know this reads like alphabet suit this is the joy of statutory interpretation um and why lawyers are often considered gluttons for punishment and no one answered that question there was a whole lot of interpreting but no one answered the question uh that's likely because the standard answer to any legal question like the one you just asked as it depends potentially we could establish that we would have to provide some competent substantial evidence if we're indicating it's a hazard and that's not simply our subjective test of why i was standing there and i felt like i couldn't handle it that seems dangerous to me that's not really the test there's going to be some kind of objective element we will have to establish an understanding all of our respective sensibilities are different and i understand you're saying i want some predictability in the policy making process you're in a vessel you hit the bottom that's pretty hazardous and that's pretty cut and dry there's no interpretation here if you're investing i don't know if that's i hear that i don't know if it all happened it's seeking to address basically um operating not really within the experience of their craft that you failed to take into consideration fedometer conditions wind speed shear tides all the whole marching one uh my question though is specifically uh i think you're alluding to a landing area my understanding we do not have any uh physical boat landing areas or offload areas on our beach is that correct the only one i know of really they're on the bay side so we don't even need nothing nothing on the golf meets the landing facility if we had the landing facility we would be able and this is where the difference comes we may be able to get there if we had the landing facility for your purposes the difference would be you could regulate without without fwc's input on the matter right absent the landing facility we may be able to get there if we can sufficiently show two a through d that i've referenced a few times and again that is either within 300 feet of a confluence of water bodies which i don't think we're talking about so we're looking at bc or d as our as our last best hope if you will and that would be b that it is subject to unsafe levels of vessel traffic congestion c that is subject to hazardous water levels or currents or containing other navigational hazards which member shirley is suggesting might be the case and perhaps we can make that showing i don't know how that comports with the fact that there are sand bars and varying water levels throughout the beaches the coastal waters of florida and item d an area that accident reports uniform boating citations vessel traffic studies or other credible data demonstrate to present a significant risk of collision or a significant threat to voting safety thus far i'm unaware of any documented objective evidence and i understand the factual circumstances that say well we've had these movies that's why the data is not there be that as it may the data isn't there so our if you are going to proceed in this fashion and attempt to have an ordinance that continues to preserve a no wake zone what we would likely have to do is establish by competent and substantial evidence that the that this area is subject or any area again to underscore miss elliot's point it doesn't have to be your whole beach if there's a 200 square feet line or 200 linear feet of beach that have this we could have a low weight zone in that area and then another area via swim area again it's any one of these or combination thereof forgive me for tapping the mic so your last best hope will be one is that it is subject to hazardous water levels or currents we're containing other navigational hazards if you're trying to preserve a noise that is your last best hope and it's going to be specific to the geography of the area identified so if you say your entire beach has that we will have to establish that and i'm going to throw a wrench in the works on that because if we have an idle idle speed no wave zone where it's not safe for boats to come in anyway what's the point why would we bring a boat in to where it's too shallow it doesn't make sense to even have those signs and again i don't know if the hazard is specific to the hazard for the vessel or the hazard for the beachgoer and swimming public or the hazard to environmental things like mangroves and seagrass i've not specifically looked into how that's interpreted i'm attempting to answer your questions while also feverishly googling to get there but uh that's thus far i don't know what the hazard has to be too for and from there that's fine i understand um let's go to glenn gunn we've not heard anything from him on this one i'll look at it from a different perspective and that is rather than start with a statute and we're trying to figure out what we want it to look like i'll start it from the desired instead what do i want it to look like my my vision of what i think it should look like is for the length of bel air beach there's there's a hierarchy and at the top of the food chain the primary customer is the swing he's the maximum user of the beach and also what we're trying to do is we're trying to build this system to reflect who the greatest users are and provide those people the maximum level of safety so at the top of this hierarchy you've got the swimmer next below that and again this is my desired interstate so the top is a swimmer the second i've got paddle boards and kayaks okay now below that i've got boats if they want to access the beach and there's some way that they can come in under control under minimum speed then that's a possibility as well at the bottom of this hierarchy are floor boards kite boards and wind surfers because they are the most dangerous in my view to the swimmer they are they can be very fast they are subject to a high workload level for the person who is using it and they can be easily distracted and the consequence of one of those high-speed uh vessels hitting a swimmer are disastrous i think so we got at the top the swimmer the paddleboards and kayaks we've got boats under control minimum speed and then at the very bottom foil boards kite boards and windsurfers and if they can't access belair beach i'm sorry again i go for maximum safety for the swimmer and if you can't access belair beach with a foil board a kiteboard or a windsurfer there's a beach just to the south of us with no buoys and no restrictions that you can you can use at any time so so i go to the city attorney i go to fwc and i say that's my desired end state i want to protect the swimmers i want to allow paddle boards and kayaks to use it if possible allow boats under control slow speed access to the beach how can we do that is that possible or do we have to draw the line there somewhere and say precisely the process we're engaged in by adopting an ordinance that reflects that i will tell you that as it relates to everything shy of allowing motorways vessels in your best bet is how where we started with one two three is number two vessels under power sail or that seems to be most aligning with the general idea that we don't want to exclude every form of vessel just those with motor motor motorization if that's the case while uh member gunn was talking i did go to 60 21 and the criteria provided says an ordinance establishing a slow speed trying to read slowly i promise minimum wage voting restricted area or numerical speed limit will be approved for areas a subject to hazardous water levels or hazardous water levels occurrings if one the voting restricted area established in the ordinance is active and enforceable only when the water levels are at or above flood stage on a river gauge operated or reported by the national weather services river forecast center or at the equivalent level on a river gauge operated or reported by the united states geological surveys national water information system and the specific gauge and flood stage water level is specified in the ordinance two a navigation chart published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's national ocean service identifies the area as being subject to hazardous ties or currents three creditable data demonstrate that the area is subject to water levels or currents that endanger vessels operating the area or the occupants of such vessels that's the that's the criteria against which that one safe harbor provision if you will would be interpreted so an afterthought for a vessel accessing the beach under control of low speed is as i stated before there's a beach just to the south of us billiard beach that has no buoys and if you want to bring a boat to the beach to load it up i can't think of a better place than with an adjacent parking lot where a person with a bellar beach parking sticker can pull his boat up to the beach walk out to the parking lot and unload his car i can't think of a better place that's where i'm at thank you very much mr gunn um before we go back around for a second round let's let's go to the citizens uh would anyone like to speak on this topic yes yes please uh come up to the podium and give us your name and address thank you cancer my name is carol connery i'm 32-10 belford guard and i'm the president of bel air students condo association so i'm actually speaking on behalf of 24 ballet beach property owners and we are adamantly opposed any kind of motorized vessel coming into the beach it would be to me a disaster we have a major hazard to any swimmer i've almost been run over by a jet ski an intoxicated female coming in about three feet of water luckily there were three or four of us and we waved at her enough that she pulled away but we could have three or four ten people in the water so that's just one simple example of what could occur i think by allowing boats to come in it would become somewhat of a party city when word gets out pull your boat up have a great time it would change the entire vibe of our family-oriented reach again i'm very adequately opposed as are all our owners to having any motorized crap show up on our beaches i could also see where we could have people decide they want to come out properly let's see if they have bathrooms let's go see if they have a pool obviously they've been trespassing but who's going to police that who's going to police motorized vehicles coming in under no way it's to me it's a disastrous idea so please please vote against it thank you thank you other citizens yes jane lochner 3320 business drive west just want to say that no matter what you do you're going to have people that are going to be opposed and i know i have one desire i won't say it because you need to make up your minds but i will stand by whatever decision is made by this board thank you very much other citizens my name is jim robbins my residence is in tampa 2523 prospect road but i'm a unit owner at 2450 gulf boulevard las caracolas and i represent that condominium association as well as the condominium associations to the south of that which would be solely sombra sanresa so i haven't done the exact count but i think it's probably around 60 or so condominium units in that combination lauren levy of our condominium group i think sent a letter to all of you all expressing our concerns we've spoken previously with all due respect to the lady that spoke earlier motorized vessels i've been a resident there for now 25 years of our unit there have been allowed up to the beach and have i think operated safely and have not caused the sorts of problems that were being described i'm also a swimmer i'm out there regularly our preference would be to try and apply to fwc under now that i understand the statutory framework better to try and continue the existing buoys there before you just gave up on that notion which have worked extremely well for the last 20 some years and if we have to try and come within the exemption that they talk about with navigational hazards the sandbars out there right now are at low tide literally at a two feet number and i would before you took the radical steps of trying to exclude all vessels or all motorized vessels that would certainly ask that you try and see if you can retain the current regulatory scheme out there within the guidelines that fwc has given you so that we could continue to operate the way that we have so and i want to say thank you to everybody that's here it's clear everybody is very concerned about safety about making sure that things operate well but there's again would be our view that the current scheme has operated well and if there was a way to continue that and i think i've heard that there's a possibility forward i would move forward to try and have fwc tell you why that isn't proper particularly with the current conditions out there so i'll stop at that thank you very much thank you very much anyone else yeah it's a picture of my daughter standing by a buoy during the extreme low tide so yes we do have problems with half couple waters thank you other comments good evening my name is fred nils and i'm 2450 a golf boulevard unit 1b i also live in tampa but this is our personal i would say second home for us we spent a lot of time there i believe my wife and i lived there for six months since we motivated and we're out here every weekend we missed this last weekend because we have a baby shower in our house but other than we go out there the reports that you're talking about in six years that you've owned i've never seen an incident and we set up we have a shaved wheel on the shaver so we set up our tent and we watch and the boats are very polite they know how to turn it they know how to spin a hook they know how to come in the power's off we've seen sailboats go out and we've seen paddle boats go out of there some of those is compromising that you guys are talking about in the layers of the tears and how to protect them i mean that is important i mean there's no question that the beach goers the swimmers that they enjoy the water they're drawn to it we're going to be continuing to it's absolutely beautiful i mean my my wife and i have a favorite and that is assassin's creed bridge hit bridge just because it just isn't it's just a beautiful view it really has i have two uh golden retrievers and we walk the bridge it's four miles from our place over back it's it's a great view it's it's everything you want when you get to the beach my personal opinion is you're giving up a little too easy with the commission okay you really are when you get into this thing of permit and then somebody can say it was issued wrongfully it was issue this i mean in a municipality you guys face that every time here's a building permit should never have given you that but you know so are we grandfathered in i don't know we haven't explored that i mean it works the way that it is okay it really does work and i understand that the buoys that are out there are somebody said that they're improper or they need work it's really a um no wake and you can't have that but you guys really there's something in that one that to see when it's talking about navigable i mean there's no boat owner that's going to come in there intentionally because they know those sandbars they know that it's beach then there's a trough and then there's a sandbar and and they know it everybody knows it so it does work i mean i think there's a reason that we can have and continue to have what we what we currently have also nobody knows what type of buoys but there is a discussion a question even then the council members what's it going to say well there's a better one what's it going to look like i mean are we literally going to have a three foot standing up buoy that's got to come out of the water i know it's got a 400 pound weight i know it's got a chain i know those chains are subject to break i know because there's ones that are missing i know you're gonna have articles i know you're gonna have you know other stuff that's there when the water goes down and you've got a six foot chain how does a swimmer deal with particles you put over on the chain so we're talking about putting other obstructions in the water so how many buoys how many are we talking about 16 we talked about 18. we talked about they're going to be yellow they're going to be green like what is it that they're going to be and i don't think members of the council member the public even know what we're looking at that you're going to put in place i mean i'd really encourage you to try to preserve what we have there's a reason why we have it it's a reason it works it's there if we had to my preference would be to remove okay i appreciate your time sir okay thank you very much thank you yes sir good evening thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak my name is eric newman in the 2450 well boulevard my family and i have lived there lived at delaware beach since 1980 and in those 41 years we've never seen any incident between boaters and swimmers for the for those of us who are property on the beach we don't see any reason that we need to trash up the beach with knee-less buoys our hope is that you just let i with the existing florida law we really don't believe that we need any more of those out there thank you for your time thank you hi my name is cliff gibbons i live at 2300 gulf hall of art here in miller region let me start by just thanking uh mrs elliot here uh mazzella you have been very courteous with me and i appreciate you helping us understand this a lot better and you've done a great job and we continue to look forward to working with you let me say this i i submitted a public records request as soon as i saw what happened in the last working room back in february mr gibbons would you put the microphone closer and it was interesting i asked one of the first questions in a public records quest which can you show confident evidence of the need for this flotilla of new buoys i talked to lynn reeves i don't know about this because he had a lot of institutional information so the freedom of information request comes back and the question was how many incidents between voters and swimmers have there been since this municipality was chartered in 1950 what is the answer you all know you've seen this for your request zero zero since 1950. now where is your competent evidence now there's a wild speculation here at this group about what's going to happen but there's no competent evidence to support what fwc is saying and what randy has said to you today so we hope that you will re-read this letter that miss elliot sent you and we along the beaches we feel very strongly in support paragraph three in that latest letter dated april 27th 2022 so i hope that you will move away from speculation and start talking about facts thank you thank you any other comments from the citizens yes ma'am i'm terry gibbons i'm 2300 go boulevard i think i'm living with them um this is this issue's come up twice now in the meetings i've met and sat in on about possible party voters i've lived at this beach and raised our children since 1990 a party boat boater typically needs a destination there are no bars or anything like that in bel air number one the boaters usually go to the islands and in addition to that we are blessed to have our belair beach police cruising the beach on a regular basis if there's any partiers that are out of hand believe me i've watched even if you're having a beer on the beach they are going to step in and take care of that you should not be paranoid about party voters thank you thank you any other comments all right let's go back to the council frank baker all right well listening to uh the citizens comments um the reason there hasn't been any incidents is because you've had buildings out there in my opinion for over 20 years but i believe the other thing was miss elliot i don't know if it's proper to ask for a question or not no we're not doing that well i don't know how many volumes of videos pictures i sent from bel air shores off the beach from first street to 19th street of children almost getting hit by boats since they removed the buoys adults within five feet of boats okay i just had one last night that came within an unmarked buoy mrs elliott at 17th street okay died david mr banker i'm gonna ask if that you refrain from framed well i'm sick of this i'm going to have to call a point of order in a work session please don't make me do that well what i'm saying not a back-and-forth conversation with the citizens we should tackle this fwc and bring them and expose them we should not have to buckle to their bullying okay and remove a 20-year fixed safety procedure that has worked this this is nonsense my table yeah i'm going back down to it again you know listening to councilman gunn councilman shirley um the rest of them is there should be some version of who's out there obviously you definitely you know it's not punishing really a lot of the good voters out there that's really attempting to protect against the high speeders um that really are outside of our city and to them use the beach for a high-speed run so what i'd like to see is kind of like along the lines of having the buoys and then within the buoys allowing the limits the paddleboards the kayaks the well i gotta be careful about wind power because wind power could also include you know the the high speed uh foil awards etc which are extremely dangerous and shouldn't be in that area but that's what i'm looking for i'm not i don't want to sue fwc um you know let's get back you know and protect the citizens out there thank you floyd roberts i'm thinking along the same lines miss elliott i do have one question for you let's assume for the moment that we put buoys out there and at this particular time the only type of watercraft that we wanted to be allowed past those buoys were like the paddle boards and the kayaks what would we have to put on the signage that would designate that so like the wind surfers and the foil which i don't have a lot of knowledge about we're not allowed can we do that and how would we do that so you you would first pass an ordinance um and if you're talking about allowing votes that are under sale or ore that's one of those one fees so you would either before you pass the ordinance or after send it to fwc and we would verify that there's substantial competent evidence that it's necessary to protect the public safety and that includes both individuals on the vessels and those not on the vessels and it is a low threshold most of the time when a local government and i don't want to say this unilaterally because there could be circumstances where this doesn't apply but in those circumstances where a jurisdiction wants to create an area where they want to have vessels under human power it's a naturally occurring dangerous situation for vessels that are motor motorized to be operating at regular speed in that same area so it's a low threshold but once you cast an ordinance then yes once you've passed your ordinance and it is given the green light by fwc just to verify that there's that necessary evidence you have to submit an application for a permit and the permit basically approves your layout for the for the movies or signs whichever you choose and so you have a lot of latitude on how you mark if there's concerns that you have too many or it's going to be littering up your waterway you may not have to put as many as your thinking or some folks may be thinking but then again they're uniform in color and design so there's there are sign colors and um specific uh designs that mean something to mariners wherever they go on the waters in the united states and so we basically make sure that they're consistent with that and yes you would be able to put up signs that tell all non-human powered and and air powered vessels that they would have to remain out and i have spoken with our regional commander down here the major who's over the entire southwest region of our agency in law enforcement um he and his folks are committed to the question was raised about enforcement um you know i don't know that there's specifically been you know they have been made aware that there are concerns about potential for endorsements to arise but we certainly can enforce as well and wouldn't be present and available to help enforce and especially when that if there was a change that occurred that we would need to be out there in force and more present with your local law enforcement as well okay so i have seen signs out there in other areas that i don't know this is still allowed today where it says posted no combustible engine craft allowed is so what is that stating exactly so there are various um there are various types of boating restricted area vessel exclusion zones um so when you get into under uh ore or under sail you can there are some local jurisdictions who want to be more limiting than that they want to say some of those are acceptable some are not for various safety reasons and then when they show substantial competent evidence for those for those you know where they make that dividing line there's different types of those kind of sub categories if you will of vessels under scale and ore that are laid out in that in florida administrative code that i explained to your council and so there are some options for if you don't want to allow all kinds of um sale or uh or vessels to be in there so those signs may look a little different depending on what type of they may be just they may say no motorized craft or vessels or they may say something about some specified types of vessels that you proved to be in there or not okay because i really think i know one time we tried to like divvy up the beach i'm not getting a great feeling that that's gonna work it's gonna cost too many people to say well i'm in a bad area i live here i just don't think that's a good solution and i agree with um councilmember gunn that i know a lot of people that own boats but if they want to come into shore there's some beautiful beach there that's just south of 19th street that have no buoys and you just come up there it's great i'm going to i'd like to bring it back to frank banker because i had to i had to stop it but i'd like to remind mr banker that miss elliot is not the fwc she is merely a representative who is here to answer any questions to the best of her knowledge and i appreciate her uh being here with us tonight so uh that being said would you please treat miss elliott as a guest she i can ask her a question well she gets a check from fwc so believe what they have miss ellie how many pictures and videos have i sent to fwc showing the hazard to from boats to a person persons that they work in fairness you've sent videos and photos to me um fwc and and the answer to that question is i'm not sure i haven't searched through the records of all of my colleagues so i can't answer that accurately um but you have submitted some video and photographs that i'm aware of and i've actually filed a complaint to have the embedded permit with so i mean you have filed to have undone what was most recently done and whether that was i don't know how staff did that because that wasn't that's not within my area of expertise that what you're saying the ultimate outcome that you wanted yes that's correct leslie i would agree with what councilmembers able and council member robert said that it seems that excluding motorized crafts is probably the easiest the safest way to go and that would be thank you jody shirley yeah so yeah just to be clear to make sure that everyone understands we're only talking about bellar beach nothing south of 19. just that seems to be an ongoing question that i've been emailed multiple times we're only we only have jurisdiction over bellar beach so my opinion is when we're looking at the options presented in front of us i think option two that randy presented to us is the best option with the exclusion of um um manpower or power and exclude sales in there i don't think sailboat should be used but when i say man powered so if it's a it's a surfboard or something like that someone just have a paddling you know swimming on a board um because it says or for sale so i'm just just noting that i think sailing vessels tend to go as mr gunn said at high speeds things like that and the current scenario we have which is idle speed no wake zone um these particular crafts that that are the most danger uh to the swimmers uh would not they would not fall into that there's no such thing as an idle speed no weight with those types of crap so we have to have to we have to try to accommodate as many people as we can while while preserving the safety of our community and these hybrids let's just call them that these hybrids have made it more challenging to have a clear definition as to what it is we want so in the case of the citizen who said how tall is the sign going to where the marker going to be well i don't really know but i i'm leaning toward option two also it sounds to me like option two is uh the easiest thing obviously you could there's no data to support it but we we know that some system of boys have managed to keep people safe for the last 20 years or something like that so the most conservative response i'd lean towards some system of bullies out there i do have a question about option two which i think is the simplest and cleanest option to go with right now it's uh oars but also for city attorney question about sale is a kite board is that considered a sale or is that something entirely different i don't know i i haven't i haven't got into the the granular elements of each kind of vessel we have based on the representation based on the language and the statute the administrative code collaborating on it and the statements from miss elliott today it's my understanding at this stage is we have the ability to make those distinctions as long as we can provide a justifiable objective basis for that and so if we say under power of war or manpower to exclude wind power vessels such as including but not limited to abcd for the reasons that xyz we may be able to get there again i i none of this is a fatal complete i can't tell you how it's going to turn out for sure because there is another administrative review but we can certainly endeavor to accommodate the particular concerns of this community and its council then that's what i'm in favor of option two or driven no wind driven because i know sooner or later someone's going to be standing on the beach arguing with the sheriff's deputy that's that's not a sale that's a kind or that that's not a kind of dental sale or whatever so all in favor of oars does that sound possible thank you very much yes there is actually a category of vessel exclusion zones that are manually powered vessels only so that would be the category that would explode those under sale and what would the verbiage on the buoy how would that read so it's going to have an emblem that indicates it's a regulatory sign meaning that if you violate the ordinance there's a there's a penalty and then it'll say um you know i'm not exactly sure but it will say something like um manually powered vessels only or something like human powered vessels only and then it will say all the others excluded it'll have this the ordinance number are we talking a paragraph no no and that's why i was hesitant to say that those are pretty well down so that there are only a few words that mean the same thing universally to to miss elliot's point i've seen samples because you are not going where no man has gone before this is um you know well shredded ground and pun intended so i would say there are samples i've seen them it's no combustible engines nothing under manpower only or something like that what i'm trying to do is get the message to the citizens that it's not going to be a high rise out there in the water correct no there are standardized height limits between three and four feet i believe is the exact number there are simple as miss elliot indicated before the signage is going to have to comport to state state standardized and national standardized standards for voters so they know what to recently expect we're not going to have towers out there it's going to be a wayfaring marker of some sort that provides guidance to vessels okay all right so to end this topic i would like to just go around and ask each person what their their choice is what what message we would like to give to you candidly mayor i believe i have my guidance the consensus going around the room was what has been described as category two and for the sake of absolute clarity in the record is a vessel exclusion zone that excludes anything under power of motor combustible engine or sail wind power sail being a little narrower to wind power such that paddle boards canoes kayaks of course rafts and other things that don't even qualify as a vessel under the statutory definition would otherwise be allowed in that area that would lead to preserving buoys generally as to the particular configuration as elliott has indicated that we will have some latitude into the number provided of course however our configuration goes if you're trying to make all kinds of zone a and b and c which you're not then you need less um and you need enough for it to be visible to the beach going public and boaters so it's easy or i shouldn't say it's easy it's understandable um to get caught the next natural step based on the dialogue at this point would be how many buoys where are they going show us the map right now what we're talking about is more a lot in line with the architectural renderings you get before something is built where they say here's a bunch of trees it's not like we're exactly going to put that number of palm trees and oaks it's just trees are going to be there so what the direction we're moving is there will be buoys what they look like their number is is really secondary to the initial process of getting approved to have a boolean disk sort and that's what we're going to work tokens and um mr riefler originally heard we were permitted for a dozen is that correct you're permitted for 16 on the visa 16 and how many do we have currently fall 12 so we would be adding the additional four that are missing if we follow the same layout is that correct yes do you have to re-sticker the ones okay provided that provided that their frame is still permissible force blocked and i say that only because i know another jurisdiction that's having to look at that their older design is no longer an acceptable design and uh one last piece of information that i would just like everyone to know mr riedler what's the distance between the permitted buoys that we have now 300 feet 300 feet between each buoy okay thank you very much all right there's no other discussion let's move on to item number one back to city attorney concerning update on the city manager contract thank you mr mayor and thank you all for your patience and continued attention so pivoting we've resolved that and we will move forward the next item that we're discussing is your selection of a city manager just to bring everybody up to speed where we left off at our last meeting this body on this topic this body had agreed to proceed with negotiations with mr ken griffin to serve as your city manager generally i had some guidance concerning salary and compensation but was authorized to enter into negotiations with mr griffin our negotiations have proved very amiable very direct that is to say it has not been contentious it has not been combative i don't think either party has been unreasonable and it's in its approach or its requests we do have a proposed agreement that was circulated to you on i believe it was thursday afternoon in full that that agreement was drafted just so you get an understanding of the process he and i had a couple phone calls a couple email exchanges again since the demands weren't too many it wasn't a constant back and forth once i had a general idea of where we were headed i also spoke with your city treasurer or department of finance your contracted finance contractor to make sure anything i was tracking towards aligned with your actual administrative and employment practices here and didn't create some kind of administrative headache in terms of its application lessons learned in the past so making sure that it's actually doable and then i specifically referenced the employee handbook your personnel policies and procedures manual your city administrative policies you've been provided all of those in full um and then also i provided you with mr reeves employment agreement so you have some kind of context for what we have where do we go this the the compensation here the salary is higher than that provided in mr reeves some of the other terms are are lower otherwise i've provided you a summary but for the benefit of those present some of the salient terms we have here the contract term is five years however it is emphasized throughout as you can see in the document that he is an at-will employee that serves as the pleasure of the council but it is not an ever-green contract such that he would be manager forever there's an opportunity to renew with that five years if the party so desire we negotiate or just go to market the salary is 140 000 a year it does not have an automatic raise raises can be provided at this value's discretion based on what it's otherwise providing employees as a whole which historically has been somewhere between three and five percent depending on the year as i understand it uh your health medical dental and vision concerns is provided completely pursuant to your personnel policies uh your life insurance pursuance policy um annual and vacation leave it presently provides 10 work days per year in years one and two for annual or vacation those terms are used sort of interchangeably in different parts so i just wanted to capture both mr griffin as a negotiating point has requested that it'd be um 15 days per year for each year of the agreement under the terms as i drafted it it would be 15 days per year starting in year three so he's just trying to get those five more days in years one and two um he did disclose to me as i've disclosed to you that he has a child getting married in october out of state and would be needing some of the time for that as far as sick leave it's 12 days per year recruit immediately retirement he would invest immediately which is part of city policy your actual plan documents and he and the city would annually contribute 10 of his salary which is again in line with your personnel policies that was not a negotiating point deferred compensation uh he he is free to contribute to any deferred compensation plan and we will execute any document as necessary as his employer to evidence or support his ability to do that we are not contributing to a deferred compensation plan that is a material difference mr reeves had had those sort of separate contributions um the phone uh your phone uh there's the contract presently provides for a 75 a month contribution towards the phone plan and that was what we had negotiated i learned after i transmitted it that there is a phone here in city hall that you've historically provided to the city manager i did speak with mr griffin to let him know that that was the only material term on which there'd been any development since he and i spoke i informed him that i would be making you aware of that he said you know of course he defers to the council but his his preference is if he could have it would be to just have the one phone he presently uses rather than carry two phones and lose track of one or the other he'd be fine with a 75 stipend he's not asking for more just he'd rather not have a second phone i i communicated to him while um you know often the philosophical reason for that and local governments his public record's concern custodial purposes but that quite honestly whether or not we provided that second phone he would still have to abide by all those requirements anyways and he certainly wasn't suggesting that he was not prepared to do so he was very aware of that and and keen on the responsibilities he'd be assuming um devices we would provide um you know a computer or tablet which we're already prepared to do automobile the city would provide 300 a month vehicle allowance um the iccma contribution we would pay dues up to 2500 i think there's there's an extra zero there it was not supposed to be 25 000. it is 2500 in the email summary not in the contract um and separation and severance i thought this was really based on what i was following in your discussion where the rubber really met the road um there was no real negotiation on this point in terms of mr griffin was amenable to its terms as i presented the draft but there was some concern here about one his tenure being you know commitment to the city and also that he not be incentivized somehow to get the job and leave sooner than later notwithstanding you know ethical considerations and so what i've done is he the severance payment increases with it's graduated with each year of commitment so in year one you'd have three weeks of his annual salary year two he'd be entailed up to six weeks you're three and nine year four and every year they're after 12. and i say they're after understanding it's a five-year agreement but if you were dude um absent some additional terms or renegotiation it would apply that way so there's never a mystery if it should have continued graduating how does that compare to some other um so by florida statute you're actually not allowed to receive more than 20 weeks complete compensation or 20 weeks of your salary as your severance compensation all rolled in meaning your salary your paid vacation leave etc customarily you generally see 12 to 15 weeks within a lot of manager contracts in large part because of what you've seen the jobs aren't just laying around to be picked up all the time and even if they are you have a larger gap between jobs it's not common to go from one manager job to the other unless immediately unless you're already looking if you you know as we joke in our in our office you're only as good as your next meeting i can come in tonight and find out i'm out of this position and you know for them while i have other cities i've represented a complicated practice that's their job and so now they're on you know so you do find 12 weeks tends to be pretty common again mr griffin had no issue with that graduated approach and that was commensurate with his representations to you that he saw this as at least a five-year stint um notwithstanding again market forces tend to put them at four to six before there's some change in the political winds or otherwise sick leave and annual leave are generally it's a sick leave is 25 of any accrued leave up to a maximum of 400 hours that 400 hours accounts for what he can actually achieve based on the contract terms and then again 100 percent then you could leave up to a maximum 40 days um in terms of accrued leave and that again comports with his acquiring either 10 or 15 depending on where he is assuming you never use them which we already know he intends to do on some level um and then as far as the the one other point was the objectives that you folks discussed at the last meeting one of the things you talked about was we if somebody new is going to come we want them to know what's expected or as yogi berra would say they don't know where you're going you'll end up somewhere else and so those objectives are laid out as an appendix to the agreement and it suggests that those may be used as evaluation criteria should you would you decide to conduct an annual evaluation which you have the right to do mr griffin in ever ever zealous actually suggested an additional objective that you may wish to consider uh which was that the council could consider adding for him to realize um a developer to realize and develop best use of the additional property the city owns its marina i'm suggesting this would be a great opportunity for him to work with the city council and citizens on their visions for this particular piece of property um not not because he has some particularized agenda just saying i recognize you have this special asset maybe that can be you know used focused on developed enhanced i don't know but that was an additional objective he said could be added to his list that he'd be amenable to so with that that's a summary of the terms now that we've kind of again forgive me for going fast but i want to be respectful of your time and we're here this long that said my view tonight is there's a few things i flagged for you where mr griffin has asked for something different or suggested something different than what is already in the agreement i would like your guidance on that if there's anything on this agreement you can't tolerate on change i'd like your guidance on that if we come out of this discussion with generally agreed upon terms i will take those to mr griffin as soon as tomorrow if not calling him tonight depending on when we leave and then we would have a meeting at some point to approve the agreement in its final form in a public hearing so there could be no question that it was entered into that the official act was taken at a public meeting um and then at that point you know we would we would set the one other thing that i would look for for you folks from that i didn't specifically address was the start date as i said in there mr griffin said he'd like at least four weeks between whenever we sign something to when he starts and unless his employer says we don't need four weeks be on your way which is entirely possible but that's the that's where we're at and that's where we're going and i'm just seeking this council's guidance on the terms we've reached and if there's anything that needs changing for us to best reflect the priorities of this council one second first off i'd like to thank you for for a great job on writing this up very extensive uh very well detailed and i'm impressed thank you what we're going to do is we're going to go around the room just like we did before this time i'm going to start with glen gunn i'm just going to ask if there's anything that you see any red flags or changes that you would like to see the leading question i have is up front we ask for a statement of earnings because to me i want to make sure that we're apples to apples and you know we we went with a 140 and that was a stretch at the time we said okay well we think we can justify that if we get a return on it well now when we start adding in the benefits and all the things that go along with our personnel that's goals additional 39 to 40 thousand dollars we're talking about so we're now in 180 000 range on this guy and that's why i go back to that earnings statement initially because i want to make sure that we're talking the same things here when he says i'm making 140 well okay well what all does that include and then the follow-on question to that is we're saying okay well all of these benefits and things in accords with our personnel manual well if we're right if we're can we exclude things out of that because we're going to be in contract with employment with this or are we automatically bound with the benefits and all the provisions of the personnel manual and policy as is written by the city so a few things pardon me a few things i'll take the questions you raised in succession the first you raised was the proof of compensation i did i did approach that discussion with mr griffin admittedly it's it's an unorthodox ask not unprecedented but unorthodox um i did i did make that ask of him if he'd be willing to provide a pay stub uh employment agreement or otherwise understanding he's also presently in the private sector um he was uncomfortable with that when especially because i explained that anything he provides the city he has to know his public record he was prepared to it didn't read to me what his pace upset i told him well i appreciate that it doesn't put me in any better position because it just shows me that you can take 52 and divide it 100 divided by 150 000 and hit the math worked but you know i i can tell you that he told me his bait upset and i'll tell you it's based up said x it doesn't really change the point you were trying to make with some kind of document um i did not i told him if your perspective on that changes to let me know i did not revisit that particular discussion as it didn't seem to be um i don't know that i was going to persuade him any differently if that is a imperative of this council i can make that known to him that was something i wanted to talk to you folks about say i committed to make me ask i made the ask if it if it's not an ask but a demand i can make that known um that's something i would see guidance from you on so that addresses the pace of inquiry can you deviate from your personnel policy for an employee and an employment contract you absolutely can um yes yes you can um you know historically you have not that doesn't mean you you're some there's no star a decisis finding president that way i tried you know in looking at what you were providing i tried to look for where was the balance between your personnel policies and what favored my client the city versus what he might have otherwise negotiated or saw there were things he asked for that i said yeah this draft says this if you wanted to say something else you can let me know but this is what the draft says it didn't really push back too much as far as can you provide less insurance less severance payment less vacation leave so long as it's not draconian i suppose yes ultimately it is a negotiation i did have a discussion with with one of you and i'll say the same to all of you here we have negotiate we have approved negotiating a contract while we may while the finish line might be in sight we're not there and so it's entirely possible that and i'm not telling you this to say don't just so we're clear on the process um he and you both have the ability to walk away and so every bit as much as you may change something you may say you know what not interested thanks but no thanks if that happens we'll just start the process over again um and or he may say great yeah no problem whatever i just want to get started what do i do so i both of those are possible results and i owe it to you to make that clear i guess what i'm going back to is when he stands there and says i make 140 and that's i won't take a dime less and we say okay well we think that's possible we're now in the ballpark where we're adding on our benefits on top of his 140 and or should we be saying hey you asked for 140 we'll work up a combination of 140 and everybody's happy yes my understanding for purposes of the negotiation just so i'm clear the 140 was a salary ask he said that in the interview and he also said it to me directly and i did ask him the question as we began negotiations to say this can look a lot of different ways you've made it pretty clear that 140 is your number there is a permutation of this where we say hey we'll give you 137 but we'll throw you three thousand dollars in the car budget instead of 300. um you know does that move the needle for you you said that if it's between my salary and some benefit allocation my number is 140 on south um and so he was there was there's no misunderstanding presently between the parties that were negotiating that the 140 number was salary not total compensation and and i guess i buy that and so that's i guess where i go back to the point of see what all those other benefits are because i think he's looking to belaru beach and the city manager job for some reasons uh subjective besides just the monetary gains to this thing so i mean let's try and work this thing out and notice those things without police i want to tell you what before i speak so he's in the private sector he's working currently in the private sector i can guarantee you these benefits are not included in his wages or his compensation and private sector i've never been in a government job i know this might be a typical compensation package but it's over the top i think there's a lot of i did not deal going into negotiation that we would go to our appointment manual for uh to see how we've treated others in the past because i just thought we were stretching the sound the wage and we're going to give him some of the benefits but not you know we're going to give him health talked about health and talked about a car allowance and a telephone i am just shocked at the severance package i'm shocked at you know you work at will i i'm just shocked at some of the things that have been offered um you know i come from a different world than many of you here so i know i may be completely off-base but i think there's somewhere in the middle that they don't that uh some of this vacation pay and the severance package is a little you know it's almost like you're going in taking a job with you already know you want to stay on five years but you've got an exit strategy every year to get a nice uh parachute on the way out the door i think i have a problem so that's my my two cents thank you very much leslie um i have to admit that i did not i did not read this email so i really can't comment on any specific sentence i'll have to take a pass boy was there anything that i mean this is very common in government very commonly setbacks was there anything that mr reeves received that you admitted something about matching um how much did that equate to we know that that was the tolerance contribution yeah so lynn um participated through compensation and he put in x dollars how much would we previously imagine from what i've heard already about men's contract versus mr griffin's contact contract lynn got more when you start matching to her compensation then did get more and mr uh griffin specifically asked for both contributions that lynn was receiving and i said that's not in history um just like we stated earlier i mean the salary is a number and your benefits are that's not uncommon at all so i think it's logical that any candidate that we chose would have expected benefits yeah it would be unusual not to offer in the government world what we've offered to visit i would like to see what we got if we offered 140 000 as a face out how many people would have stayed in the game well yeah that's something we'll never know but we did discuss that going into it about we weren't going to put a cap on it because we didn't know and really i have to admit we didn't discuss well like what we're going to offer may depend on what the other individual candidate was making we need to talk about that we talked about what were their skill sets what was their knowledge what was their experience that would factor in to what number we may have decided and that's that's exactly [Music] why we agreed to move forward because he met the skill sets he met the requirements of what we were looking for and i have to admit if i put myself in his shoes and i've had more than several positions in my life working and nobody has ever asked me to show them what i was currently making based on that's what i put on the application so that's like well what do you what are you i mean my first thought is do you think i'm lying and that'll be my first thought you know initially but i don't think i don't think it's out of the realm of asking because we want to as you stated and we want to make sure that we're going we're going much higher than we would typically go so we want to make sure that that looks freaking so again can i qualify that sure go right i guess what i would say then is like we thought about initially was opening up this negotiation with what do you want that's what i that's what we had stated yeah so i don't know how we've never gotten that number and so all i'm saying is when you say 140 add-on then 39 to 40 000. well what do you want you're telling me you want 180 000. right right so randy is that is that how that did he have a copy like because that's public record is that something he had asked for he already had a copy of mr reeves okay that makes sense that he began speaking yeah i i did open with a what are you seeking here um you know i understand you've made salary clear i did ask the salary and benefit trade-off he said short short form i'm functionally seeking either what is in your personnel policy or what is in mr reeves contract and so i i proceeded and i proceeded with what i felt was the more conservative either as i as i proceeded or otherwise reflected on the views of this council for example in the tiered severance process and i remember surely i'm i appreciate your feedback i really do know i take no issue i'm not about feedback in the process um i do but as far as as far as how that goes i did and and again i also have the benefit um part of why you hired our firm not just me of saying what have we done in other communities what does this look like i've negotiated a few manager contracts and also took what i felt were the better protections from those and reflections of the process because you'll find something for example that says your severance is 12 weeks well it didn't specify in the contract where the taxes were withheld now we're fighting over whether but you know those sorts of little things that happen when people are now breaking up or going through a divorce in the public sphere and so trying to resolve as much as that as we could anticipating all those eventualities now you're never going to get everything but we did have the discussion not from a stance of i'm ready to give you the sun moon and stars do you want all the above or not it was really tell me what you're seeking here and and i do think it is accurate to say that while the 140 number was always the number my my guidance as i understood it based on the notes i took was we're generally trying to take care of the of the insurance stuff and nobody's really equivalent there we did want to do something for the cell phone we did generally want to do something for transit and i think it was more as you speak about them in isolation rather than context then you start to realize well you know i definitely drafted this with your feedback in mind and as it adds up no question thank you mike sabor uh yeah uh first of all i want to tell you i don't want to micromanage us thank you very much you're doing exactly what you know we called for uh i understood 140 was the salary you know that would work this is the potential and not only for him but for everybody else is look you have vacation days and you have sick days companies today are doing that really you talk about sick days those are a vacation day with sound effects that's right look just give him a bundle you have up to what 10 plus 12. you've got 22 days a year it's up to you if you're sick use them if you're the kid whatever you know it's up to you maybe propose that to him you know because i do agree look the first few years two weeks and he started building up time you know three you know three weeks et cetera maybe by giving him that that'll satisfy his need for 15 days out of the back and you know if possible you know look at that for other city employees and same thing and said here's your bucket with time use it as you will that's it thank you i think if i could comment on it i don't know if this is exactly correct but i think when somebody does lead you know if you have so much sick leave and so much annually it's paid differently so they annually you get 100 of your salary basically typically it's 25 percent oh that's that is how it reads in our policy oh your policy about that government no i've not been both no i understand and not in my policy in the personnel policy that's in place before i got here that's how you treat your employees however comma if we are going to combine them then that can be done with that in mind and say well you're going to get 25 up to 400 hours of sick and 100 up to 40 days of annual we'll give you answer percentage here because i'm not going to be the guy who does it first um of that new combined number where there's in ours in ours you're talking and i'm talking about you know government you know senior executive you know civilian the whole pit they're all paying the same you just boom there's your time and then you do have an accidents per year you know because at some point it's you to lose yeah that's that's the way we handle it on my job they're one and the same and uh rather than giving them a bucket full of sick days and a bucket of vacation days you combine the bucket but it's a much smaller box but yeah count to time right so that i would definitely i would entertain that maybe maybe reducing that's a lot of time and many people observe sick days as vacation days they just do it one day at a time that's all the answers strategic planning tool frank baker well we wanted about 30 to 40 percent of what to work during salary negotiations before we even closed the city manager's applications my colleague to the right he wanted to go along thousands put it on council that failed it was too much so this council agreed that mr griffin is going to be hired on speculation that he's going to bring all this grant money and pay for himself have we placed any goals in his contract to show for him to show us these are the grants that he's bringing in and how much it is so we can say hey hey this is this is the guy we shouldn't pick this is a good pick like the timeline in six months you've got you guys this rant and here you got this grant is there anything yes there is um it's not again when you're drafting objectives in an employment contract you don't typically make them a very specific number that way especially in the public sector given the variety of influences but one of the ones that you specifically as a council agreed to it's the very first objective in appendix b to the contract on page 12-12 of what i circulated to you it says establish and implement a structured grant policy or process this process should proactively seek alternative or supplemental funding for any present or future bellar beach initiative project or acquisition although primarily focused on capital assets and infrastructure projects great policy shall not be limited in scope to these topics the goal of the grant policy or process is to maximize any diverse funding sources beyond the city's traditional revenue sources wherever possible at minimum the grant policy or process must a designated grant process owner which can but need not be the manager and b outline a method for evaluating and trafficking grant tracking grant applications with reference to the capital improvement plan the cip and budget process so that is specifically what it says about grants now it doesn't say and you shall acquire 75 000 by date certain but it does give that that is the language that based on your feedback did end up in that i guess a better question i should ask what is what is the mechanism going to be used if he doesn't achieve that you will fire him as your as the council has well to do if you so desire yeah and i want to be very clear about that i mean this is an app and i'm sorry i don't mean to speak over you i just want to be very clear this is an applicable employee that serves at the pleasure of this council now i i want to ground this in the discussion of the of the agreement itself there are two forms of termination which is very common in the sector one is for cause and the other is without cause four cause is you've committed fraud you were arrested on dui convicted and we find that that is you know a conviction that we cannot tolerate or something else it's set forth in the agreement and enumerates the things that are for cause for cause is not i don't like the cut of his jib uh you know he's not you know those sort of intent until he lacks fire in the belly those sort of intangible things you hear we've reached creative differences that stuff is without now a four cause termination under the screen it requires six of you because it because what happens when you're terminated for cause is you get nothing you leave you loser to quote so the the other option is without cause without cause they get the severance payment based on the year that is in there but without cause can happen tomorrow it can happen six months from now that simply requires a simple majority under this agreement um so that if four of you at any time independently reach that conclusion with all respect to the sunshine law and public records law and you do that and you terminate them then that's your will i mean i i will tell you i was just in a community that hired a manager in august and while he resigned in april there was some sentiment that if that didn't happen sooner than later there might he may be subjected to a vote and we don't know if they would have had the votes or not but you know that was less than a year it can happen there's some managers who've served decades as you mentioned one of your friends and so ultimately if they don't reach the metrics and enough of you agree that that was a high enough priority or they're just failing you have the ability to terminate the agreement at any time and that's not such the one that's just the majority that's just a majority a simple you know what i think we need to move in a new direction is a and that's often the way you hear it phrased in public in part so people can continue to pursue a lively life and you don't go about personal destruction wantonly but if you're simply terminating them because it's no longer a fit for it when one of you comes to me and makes a motion now i will tell you your charter and code they have a whole process for what that looks like i think it's section 4.03 or 3.04 as to what it looks like to terminate the manager and so we would have to go through that process and it has a due process like a hearing and a submission and an opportunity for a response but we would go through that process well i also just said if he we can add in here that we do an evaluation after a certain period of time and if he's not hitting these objectives in the opening um provision under section one duties um actually where where the where the appendix b is referenced and then um xp so griffin hereby agrees to employee manager or sorry um sorry it should say town uh city hereby agrees to employ manager to perform the duty specified in article 3 section 3.02 of the city charter in addition to those responsibilities explicitly set forth in the city's charter and code of ordinances in his first year of employment the city has established the objective set forth in appendix b of this agreement these objectives shall be tracked by the city council and may be the subject of griffin's performance evaluation what would he receive if he terminated well it depends what happens because he didn't check he didn't meet these goals would he still get his you would get exactly what he gets for being terminated without cause so it would be and if it happened in if it happened after day 365 on day 366 is it's still year one to two i believe is the three weeks if it gets to year two then it's six weeks but he gets to six weeks twenty five percent of the sick leave a hundred percent of annual leave unless based on the direction of this discussion you combine those two and come up with some other new percentage but otherwise a percentage of leave whatever the contract provides and whatever the severance payment is based on his tenure at the time my question is though how many more candidates if we would have put that 140 figure out plus 40 000. 000 a is i spoke to a mayor that had a singular uh situation no no commerce to speak of uh i think 135 000 plus singular uh benefits package so kind of enrage in a very expensive area all right thank you frank tell you i'd like to wrap this up and i'd also like to take a break don't take five minutes sure sure all right 21 we're back not too bad six minutes all right um do we have any other comments on this or do we uh yes uh vice america i just had a thought you know there's emphasis on kind of tracking him and evaluating first initial period uh the honduran phase of his employment and there was no provisions for increases or raises written into the current but maybe maybe that's a consideration maybe you go with the salary and you scale back the benefits for the first year or something and then once you have that evaluation if everything is thumbs up and a green light that's where you kick in the benefits it would be similar to like a step increase or [Music] to raise assistance one of the uh one of the items that i negotiated for whenever i came down here was they offered me two weeks of a vacation to start with and i had three or four weeks in my old job and i didn't want to lose it so one of the one of the items that i threw out there was i want at least three weeks vacation so i i kind of understand where he's going with all this and he's probably trying to at least meet the standard that he has now i don't know what we could do to to where you would kick in those benefits as life goes on i think randy's done a great job of setting this up it's a little shocking to me also about what it takes to have an employee these days my thing was you know hey i i'm the guy that brought him above that line because i saw his skill set i said you know that's something we really could use here so you know i'm all for it and i was also a big backer background to return our investment right very behind this thing but i just want to make sure that we understand that you know when you take the dollar value of paying compensation and divided by a skill set you know initially 140 was in the the top and now it's 180 in the top and i just want to make sure we're all thinking well let's just say if you were if we went back to the 110 [Music] you still would have those benefits you would still be paying those benefits for no matter who it is because that's you can't hire someone without providing them with a benefits package also that's just well you said you said you can well of course you can but but seriously yeah who does that otherwise we could just hire him as a contract laborer and uh there you go you're on your own there's your 140k and you know what the fact that we don't have anything in the contract that says you're guaranteed of an increase you know annually and when you talk about 140 number uh that's 4 200 and by the way that was a requested term in the negotiation i said that's not how it reads and unless so at the end of the first year i mean theoretically even if he or she did a good job um we could just say well we think we start in jeopardy okay well just remember those words when every year they come back and ask for three to five percent i'm just saying all right but in the contract it's still great but it's just saying it's not expected and you can't hold it every year that we're being here asking for are we going to be negotiating his contract for his increase we generally don't negotiate a contract with us in patty's case we um we we all do a review we come up with a score and then uh i think that it's predetermined there was a really range of brains what we're saying is that's usually around february january february are we going to do that with mr griffin so they just came on and there's a couple of things that i agree with this number one we can't wait a year to review this guy engage his performance we the best case scenario i would say 11 months because if we hit 12 months well now we've just lost a bunch of money if we don't like it because now we're having to pay more than the one year release so i think that an 11 month honest and fair review of his performance should be expected out of us and then of course the the i think that he the way that patty is reviewed and the way that lynn has been reviewed in the past i think that it's totally different i think that he he should be handled uh uh on his anniversary day we do a formal review and then we decide uh as a council of what it is we want to do whether we want to give him anything else or let him go or keep him right where he's at mayor the only thing i would add to that calculus from a management or administrative standpoint is that one he's starting close to october which is kind of nice for you folks because that discussion would also likely be part of your budget discussions so you may wish to have that even sooner than the 11 months so that you can say all right in july we're already talking about whether or not we're tracking towards some kind of increase or otherwise it's part of our budget discussion because that's really where the change is going to be made we don't unless we say we're going to we can create the moment to the agreement each year which is another option and say effective this date the new addendum c is pay shipping will change one provision or you can do it as part of the budget discussion which is another way it's handled in another in various other communities without necessarily like reopening or addressing the contract you just say they make an allocation in the budget and i see what you're saying so what we would do is whenever we were reviewing salaries in the budget and we get to the city manager portion of that budget we stop what we're doing and we do our yearly review of the city management procedurally it's whether you stop what you're doing or you just have the discussion as part of that process yes one way or the other during your workshopping process there is a point where somebody says seeking council consensus on you know the raise of the manager if any and you have that discussion at some point it just to clarify um from when they was just saying about the 11th month so my understanding was the state of war is going to happen we're talking about terminating people and i think this guy's going to do a great job personally so he's listening that's how i feel um if somebody you said a gentleman or some person just got terminated after five months five months and 15 months under the current contract same i want to make sure one person walks away i believe the way the wave reads here there's a different level of severance between year one and year two year one is three weeks salary your two is a six week salary so once you cross the 12 month level in a day i thought you were saying like it was the full the full from the beginning of time to the and we'll have to look at it i will just say now because there's a process in your code in your charter um if you are if any of you are ever headed in that direction seeking advice with that concept of mine we need to look at how does that align with how this process is going to go is this process going to take us 45 days and you're asking me on day 30. you know we'll have to look at that um but that's that's sort of the equation that's that's your option there's two options one is yeah if he voluntarily separates it it provides the memphis he'll get his lead and that's it and the way that i'm reading this this person can work one day and if we say no it's not working out now he's guaranteed three weeks correct that's drafted that is how many weeks is everybody good with that i i don't know i think that there should be a great period he could be negotiating with his current employer to stay and then come here and work one day i think there should be a probationary period six months or something and at that point we go are you kind of meeting the goals that's a that's i mean that's just huge i think you should still get the lead starting day one what's your request if you want to put something in there that if he leaves in a very short period of time and that's what i was asking for initially was that i mean you did a great job but you saw balding a little bit and and i would i would think that we need maybe six months and then and then after six months fine you know move forward with the three weeks and um and then the rest of the schedule i think would be okay everyone else what's your thoughts on it if he left on his own no you're talking about the issue the issue on being discussed right now is is giving three weeks at any point in the first year but too much of a gift and the mayor and i think member shirley has suggested maybe instead of three weeks starting day one it's three weeks starting month six or month eight or whatever the number worth or 90 days whatever it is such that there is a period of time within which if you terminated him fairly immediately in relationship to a five-year agreement he wouldn't get anything but he already told us he needs time off for the wedding from his daughter yeah but no no we're talking about severance payment for termination okay so if you terminate him on day 14 right okay does he get three weeks or does he get zero yeah if you terminate him on day 91 is it three weeks or zero presently it's three weeks from day one if you folks want a period where that is zero weeks then i need to know what that period is and that's where i think that six months would be a fair amount of time for him to prove himself and then now we've seen some work done and again if he's terminated without cause then that's a severance but it only kicks in six months in one day if we terminate him without cause he gets the severance package and uh to be clear to the extent he best with and again this is a separate question we have to address but if it's annual versus sick leave or just leave leave presently under both he vests the full amount on day one and he would be paid out pursuant to being terminated without cause for his leave yeah by whatever percentage let's and i would recommend not fiddling with that sickly manually thing i mean our policy currently says what's the percentage of sick leave your pay 25 400 for him our number's different it's higher ethic actually very common in government very common government i'm talking federal and uh we're traveling yeah so sorry i got 36 years with your indulgence i think it might be easiest if i just ask where i understand the outstanding points to be um before you do that as soon as we wrap this up we're going to knock out some of these short ones but i'm going to ask that we end this at nine o'clock okay i will do my level best to speak fast as we get to those recording um the first item uh that we've discussed it sounds like there's generally consensus that there would be no severance payment if terminated in the first six if he is terminated in the first six months of the agreement is that correct general yes yes or if he means already if he leaves he gets nothing so it's just if we fight if you know if you terminate his employment in the first six months no severance being correct without god's correct with alcohol and with cause um and then as part of that well i guess the next question cell phone presently the agreement says we would provide 75 a month we do have a cell phone here his request was i'd rather the stipend and just keep my one phone rather than dealing two does this council have any strong sentiment on what that would be or consensus direction i don't know what the country should say we return that phone yeah we should probably cancel the plan i'm i am no problem with him using his own phone i'm carrying two right now i have to be honest with you okay so that answers that we can just keep it as it is go back to the first one just very quickly so just like randy mentioned earlier so something is you know he's leaving a job he's taking another job he has no idea so we lose our minds or whatever and he gets terminated within the first three months he's getting nothing from the severance standpoint and he has to try to find another job at that level that's not something you typically are able to achieve in a week so that's why you have those things in place that provides an extreme [Music] and it's really just to say if after six months he's sitting on the corner doing nothing we at least have some sure you know any story he has his sick pain and vacation right um the next question i had was there's been some discussion on the dichotomy between sickly versus annual leave or do we just call it leave and create some kind of hybrid number and hybrid percentage what say you counsel on that how many different whereas it's partial pay on the other one i don't know now i'm kind of leaning towards the other way okay this is an excellent point that when lead is nothing more than vacation i mean and so why do we want to make wires because you know what i'm saying oh no that's why it's a panel and again you cut the number right here let me have the ability if you want to say and you're right there's one type of leave at a reduced pay percent not 100 doesn't have to be 100. if you want to pick a different number you can pick a different number subject of course to your the other person on the other side of the negotiating table accepting it this is my personal opinion the expectations are you would not see a city manager anywhere in this state playing that type of game that's a whole different level you got to be kidding me i realize there are some city staff town staffs around that that do play that game that's not game's not going to be played whenever you say game are you referring to the um they looking for the sick days and vacation days so the way it's presently written he gets 10 days each year one year two and then 15 every year and thereafter for annual vacation and he gets 12 days here he's getting he's getting he's getting no he's not getting 15 the first year he's asking for 15 the first year but presently he under the agreement um provides right now vacation leave he gets 10 work days per year in year one year two two full work weeks and then year three onward he gets 15 days his ass was can i just have 15 days starting day one and then and then as far as sick leave goes as far as sick leave he gets excuse me 12 days per year each year year one those are not improved times never about day one those are both yeah it's all you best on day one with both all right customary for a manager all right i know somebody's getting married and everything and i understand that and uh council 15 or 10. i'm going i still go and it's back to just we'll do it that way and then that payout we'll pay a 20 that will pay him 75 percent right okay so why even make it 22 let's just make it an even 20 and you do whatever you want to with them okay 20 days paid out at 75 percent of all separation yeah i'm not for that i already already stated but that's what you guys want to do that's fine we're not going to worry there appears to be consensus direction for 20 days at least four of you were generally saying 20 days by your head shakes head nods and paid out at i wasn't clear if it's 75 somebody said 75 percent otherwise anybody else wishes to speak you can not say 75 i think if somebody's if they've got their time they've got their time and it's it's 100 it's the way i've i've always seen it if you have your vacation days and you exit that's your time because generally you accrue that time and that's your choice [Music] is time that he accrues on day one it's not created gradually but under the contract has accrued on day one he's getting its contractual we're giving him those days on day one and what we pay out can also be contractually defined so i'm just seeking what it whatever that number is you guys are looking for so far 20 days of leave no special names to it and mayor and remember roberts are saying 100 percent and [Music] except the military you know day one seaman apprentice gets 30 days leave a year in the public sector that i've seen you walk in your first year man you get maybe seven days and then year two you get ten days i will tell you this is a customary arrangement for city managers it's pretty hard to leave the military no one severely objects to this i say we move on so what will we do after year one would increase or year two or whatever it was so what i'm what i'm hearing that my my understanding of your direction no graduation it's 20 days a year every year recruit each year on your anniversary day no accumulation so just an easy graduation or no 20 years is a lot of time oh well 20 days 20 days and 20 years much more a longer time three days the first year that's our year that's what i'm hearing is because up presently under the under the agreement and i'm sorry i want to make sure i'm clear about this if you don't change the agreement as drafted in year one you would have 10 days of vacation need and 12 days of sick leave which would come to 22 your what you're saying is let's bring it down to 20 and just forget the artificial as some would submit distinctions between the two and so net effect is you're actually negotiating to less leave days but just without any kind of set circumstance purpose i would not i would go with the 22 so 12 and 10 right for the first two years 22 league days period and then since in the in this contract already we were increasing it by how many days in year 35 or three years so we would say 22 then go to 27. and that's the benefit of leaving it sick in vacation in my mind it's like year one you've got 12 days vacation if you're sick you're sick you're taking six days but you're one you've got 12 vacation days i guess what i'm saying is decreasing you don't walk through the door and get 20 days vacation but what i'm saying when you're sick and typically you're not combining every vacation [Music] [Music] that's an improvement to him if you'll like that if i want issues i'd say cool i'm good but that's what's better yeah you know and maybe that'll soften the flow of the six month cooling period where okay okay the the things hopefully this one's simpler the added objective that he suggested about working with the council on marina assets do you wish that added to appendix b certainly looking into it with him i don't know if that will happen but and then the one other thing was uh start date he in his representations to you was once we have an agreement his aim once we have a signed agreement uh his name would be to start within four weeks of that um which kind of leads to a second discussion i obviously have to speak to him in the next 24 hours to see if he's receptive to this feedback if he is then when do we want to meet to bless this we'll inform when his start date is a special meeting 24 hours 48 i'll look to your hours on that something to consider we don't have to clear calendars now if it's easier for your phones we can but that's just the one other thing that i think informs the discussion otherwise i have all the guidance i need from you folks to to button up in terms of the agreement well it's obvious we're not going to get through this work session agenda but we're voting so we could do a back-to-back work session and i think we're going to have to have one more just to wrap these up and uh and then we'll have a special meeting right before that is everybody good with that i am i am sensitive to the fact that we've you know reunited once a week every week i'm not trying to do that to you but i do want to make sure there's no question um as far as process so just want to hang out man yeah so with that i have the guidance i think i need unless there's anything within the agreement um this council feels hasn't been sufficiently interested okay great thank you very much and uh please proceed let's move to item two right quick uh interim city manager briefly bring this in and i'm sorry for taking this long but here we are yeah first uh outstanding i'd like to discuss is the 114 16th street this was uh patrick drummond he came to our june council meeting school of steering assistant comments just for real i cannot hear you at all so live laura put together a timeline for you um we centered out last week and uh hopefully you had a chance to look over it um some things to point out so this is this is drummond this is 114 16th street it all started uh from a delinquent rental registration you can see uh in the history from 2013 there was a rental administration fees paid 2019 it was paid from direct internet consulting and then it included a late fee and then in 2020 it was the bounced check which we have a copy of from shannon evans but that's kind of what started it all it was a bounce check this said a lot on notice of not sufficient funds went out a whole year passed to the actual next mental registration period and at that point it was a notice a violation was sent and a notice of hearing during this time the notices were sent to the property appraiser address that we had on file which was the actual property it's the same address that was used for all the previous years for the rental registration request letter so that never changed so that the letter was sent out the hearing was had he there was a no-show there was a fine assessed with late fees that time passed it started accruing uh fines every day plus interest that went by for a whole other year into 2022 [Music] still no contact every time interest charges or a invoice was made it was sent to the same address so then you come around to 2022 [Music] still no contact and then shortly after january 13 2022 there was a notification of lien that was sent that was after that was said and then contact was made so i guess what's that notification of lean it got some attention in that time period there was correspondence with that property owner in the city uh the previous city manager took a payment of 835 which covered the rental registration plus the late fees for both years and the bounce check fee which in turn was agreed that it stopped the fines so the fines are stopped at that point they weren't accruing anymore which worth of 75 per day that was over a year and from there it was only uh interest charges that were being invoiced monthly on top of the balance and it got us up to the current amount of twenty nine thousand almost thirty thousand dollars worth of fines uh at the april eleventh meeting as previous city manager lynn reeves i was sorry about work session uh discuss this case with you uh proposed the idea of doing a 50 um lean reduction that was agreed upon or consensus he went back and presented that to mr drummond mr drummond thought that his case was not represented to the best of the ability um that's why i guess he came to our meeting um because he wasn't satisfied with that 50 of the time i think it was at 26 000 so 1300 so my recommendation you know based on all this i calculated the city's time out of pocket just to get his whole is a little over three thousand dollars he i know he's tried to propose about a thousand he calculated i definitely think thirty thousand dollars at least that's the bare minimum but i also want to bring in consideration that this is the cost to the city without any kind of punishment for being delinquent and we should probably be careful because if we're just going to let this delinquency pass for a year plus um and then ultimately end up in just what it cost us i don't know if that's a good question so my proposal would be to give him somewhere in the middle at a 25 percent um so it's 75 reduction of 25 percent of that total 30 000 about 7 500 i think is a fair amount it at least represents some kind of punishment and time spent from the city i i know that we've done this in the past and i thought that the council as a whole pretty much thought that 50 was fair whenever it gets crazy like this just out of control uh there's no coming back um i i don't want to set a presence where people think that they can be like this guy and get off with 25 i just don't want to see that happen let's start with frank baker um my thoughts or what talking mr drummond is it's his mother's house he wants we want to sell it leave the air um and the master bedroom if the person that has a lien or a fine sells the house and leaves the area because then we're getting rid of it i'm not saying mr trump is a bad resident or anything like that but the whole idea is to get the property back to where it's supposed to be we're following so can we reduce it to like 25 or something like that with concrete evidence that they're going to leave the area the leak is lifted after they make settlement or it's partly the settlement process so yes you have the ability to release the lien um of course that's sort of what we're discussing here tonight can you do it for some less than the sum of the lien absolutely you can um if you're trying the if in fact this individual is attempting to sell their property they're motivated to get the lien released before the sale because the lien is an encumbrance to the sale so waiting until they're done and settled doesn't get you there the risk you run is if you release the lien as to this property owner and then the sale doesn't go through the lien is released why short answer no because the lien is still going to show on the title and the i mean i i can talk to my colleagues but i've not seen that sort of arrangement you're releasing you know the lien runs with the win runs with the property if somebody buys subject to that lien i've seen situations where someone says i'm prepared to buy it we're in mediate in these places and if i do a b and c after after after after my purchase you know will you agree to release the lead any sort of entry into the deal with some good faith reliance if you will on the city in that regard um but we're not dealing with any potential buyer here specifically we're dealing with the current property owner so in that arrangement i would i would caution against doing so because you may end up with buyers or resource remorse as it were where did you say this property is at 114 16th street it's at the end of the cul-de-sac right on the north it's a gorgeous yeah okay so it's not a cheap place what i'm thinking is uh this is an older home and more than likely whoever buys it is going to knock it down and rebuild it okay so what being probably also a cash buyer and i think that that's something that he could work out with his buyer where they write a contract they work that amongst themselves the the current owner brings you a check for 50 of the amount and now the title is clear and free and they can do whatever they want to i don't really see this as is our problem i just i'm having the rest of us kind of check in a little bit sure all right two things is as far as i don't think we would reduce it to 50 that's kind of been a standard we set we don't reduce it anymore uh clearly the lien being filed spoke loud and clear he ignored every other communication we had the man had no interest in settling so uh we've we've used a lot of the city's time we've used a lot of our time this is about the third time we've talked about it in these meetings we agreed to a 50 settlement we stick with it we can reduce the lien we can refile the mean at 50 when the house sells it'll be paid either he pays it now or if he pays it what it sells and the title company will make sure it's paid that's all we need to do we don't have to do anything else i don't see any point rehashing the same conversation over and over agree it was a no-show here in fact as well so it's not just us it was the court system so much time has been spent on it because it goes or the title company picks up that link will show 29 000 once it's filed i'd leave it unless he has another issue where he's you know at the house if there's another problem that you know has another violation and we deal with that so he'll lock it at 50 no interest occurred but we can refile and be cleared and win because that property is looks like he put double story on it now he's got a vague view let me ask you something what's the how long does it take to refile away it's just recording it right yeah that's all it is it's just preparing the paperwork it's not even going to take a couple a couple of days i don't know why we're even talking about this he obviously wants to sell it but we don't know if he's bluffing or what the plan is i say we continue to let this thing roll until he's serious and he's ready to come up with 50 and and if he's going to sell his house or whatever but until he's willing to actually say all right please stop the meter i'll pay 50 otherwise how are we going to get interest it's still a it's a perpetual loan interest rate that's my recommendation he doesn't want the interest to approve he can give right yeah otherwise it's going to keep rolling and that number is going to get obviously he'll you can approach him and say 50 tell us i would say the deadline uh is whenever he actually comes up with it but that meter's running even though he's getting it at a reduced rate it's uh that's a lot of money and uh if he's gonna sell it he better get put it on the market and get busy what if he comes back and he says uh can i have the offer that was made after the 11 the april 11th meeting which was probably around 26 um 50 where he thought that his arguments weren't presented you're talking about the 50 percent months ago yes well there that was a month ago he's still running yeah yeah um i think it's more than one i can't remember exactly how many it is but it's more than one so it yeah because we keep filing his interest we have to do something because this is this is becoming a problem there's people that are problems or problems and they don't fit that one next door otherwise we'll we'll give him a number and he can take as long as he wants to pay him don't come here all right i don't know if i even want to talk about this two times which one uh 10 21 oh it didn't work 177 oh okay that one that one is still still going that's the 103 25th street i just wanted to make you aware of where we're at at this point that is a expired permit and then a hearing that was required to give a schedule of a timeline schedule when certain construction parts would be completed did it was brought back to another hearing because that schedule wasn't followed it's being fined based on each item that hasn't been completed on that schedule so it's been just rolling and this is an ongoing issue if you remember that the permit was issued in 2018 or in 2022 there's been a lot of interaction from residents in that neighborhood who are unhappy with the house taking so long to be included what's the understanding this is on when i was raised 25th street this is the white house on hibiscus yes 103 25th it's not a quarter that's another discus so look up yeah yeah you go down golf take a look there's this white house now this this owner has been in contact coming to the hearings he's fully aware all on the road this is the one we told to put the lights up and he didn't like it so he tore them all down for any lights and put him in the air so that's just an update there's really nothing we can do on this one just yet it doesn't even have a permit to work right now is that correct uh there's not a stop work order so there is um permanent is expired but we are still expecting them to complete work um currently they have something in for review which is that it's there and landing on the uh east side um in which we're getting back to them i can uh check the schedule and see what where they're currently delinquent as far as completing the project estimated time until he's finished that's fine that's a tough one all right and now the uh so 1041 that's the house on the corner right here at causeway and golf um there's been some history of that house being an issue uh there was a lot of ceiling i guess had fallen at one point we've done some abatements on that but that's not in question the most recent fines were for a pool that you know was was not running and clean and also the screen enclosure was a mess and it needed to be repaired so there was a hearing on february 10th was an order given and uh it was given that by march 5th or march 13th the pool had to be completed and by april 13th the screens are paired so it's one month for the pool two months for the screens um what happened was the fines started accruing at 100 a day after march 13th for the pool and at 200 a day for the screenings after april 13th the sh okay so i provide i provided you with what her side of the story is she has provided documentation that does show that the pool was emptied and drained by before the march 13th so that was actually taking care of the problem there is that she never officially reported to the city at the time that jalen reused the previous city manager that was addressed and then the screens she provided that the screens were finished on may 3rd so the work was completely amazed that's 20 days lynn stopped the fines on may 18th which was 30 days worth of fines so the question here is um she didn't fulfill in in the order that was given at the urine by the magistrate it said specifically that you have to notify the city when the world was completed she did not do that she does claim that she tried to contact lynn but was on the angle of unsuccessful too bottom line she's at 13 000 to 200 and you could 50 percent it puts you in like 66 hundred dollars um and if you were to apply these uh this reduction based on when she had the word complete it would take her down a little bit more um people knocked off about eight thousand one hundred dollars from the thirteen from the thirteen so it was fine yeah if it was yeah you're looking at a thousand dollars yes okay looking just simply looking at the statement the lady doesn't even know the grass we're maintaining her grass for her this house is ridiculous violations like crazy right now just walk by there the thing is covered in mildew which is not permissible under our code um draining the pool because you don't want to maintain it doesn't seem like a good option well she has she has put a pump in she's intrigued yeah and then boarding up the screen enclosure because you don't have screen isn't a good option either there were a number of infractions ever since she's on the house there's been no maintenance you can't buy a home and just leave it to with no maintenance and that's what's happening in our community we have several homes like this in this case i don't think that house has been maintained maybe you should put a roof on it but she's done nothing else there she's cleaned up the last couple days yeah the last because of this i'm in total agreement and i'm not even in favor of giving her 50 off because there's been a total disregard in expecting the city to mow her cracks and the city does it after i call and say has anyone contacted her about the overview you can't even see to make a right-hand turn around the bushes i mean it was you had weeds coming out into this side yeah such a hazard and no maintenance and we see that's the entrance to our city that's what we see every day you come by here and no one's done anything about it i think she should pay for i just she's done there's probably more violations than what you guys have to find her for and she's living in the house no no yeah is there power to it yeah there's power you don't see people here for once and then all of a sudden you'll see a couple utility choices so i would i would suggest we she also would like to sell the house let's lean it and get full payment of the lean as it exists that's just my feeling i there's just complete disregard for the neighbors there and i if i lived next to that house i would be so angry she's talking about one problem but there's she's been a problem since she bought i don't know when did she buy that property it's never been maintained i think we've updated it twice but she the last one's not on here because it was paid for it but it looks like um i think there was a coat of paint or something put on it like a year ago maybe two or something like that i don't know if that if or if it was just washed or what but it looked like they try to clean it at one time that's probably whatever this is and at this point do we have pending fines or pending infractions signs have stopped waitresses running okay so the fines have stopped now interest is running i i mean we're we're sort of setting a precedence for these real high ones i know we are all sick of this but even seven thousand dollars is a big chunk of change and i think that that would send a clear signal so i would be integrated with getting half on this and maybe the clock will start running again i would say that would be the only opportunity she has and the next time no breaks and maybe give her a list of things that need to be corrected as it sits right now too you know because it is covered with mildew that's not allowable in the city i know she's trying to sell the property and he would have to get have a code search done to it for sale yeah she's not gonna solve that condition that's one minute again a cash buyer they don't they're not under the same company does everybody agree with that in half what i'm saying that's oh there's many people's grass that we move around here is that right we're not all the time we try to avoid it we send our letters out what's your rate how they hire you all right let's just let's go around right quick take a a consensus vote here 50 okay it's 100 then any other uh thousand dollars worth of things that you mentioned so that would be if you took the evidence that she provided of the work being complete and stopped the fines on those exact days that would save her about eight thousand one hundred dollars a little more than fifty percent i think we can have recording fees are we able to record the liens on this recording are there any other homes that was hit right yeah that is it uh good news is we actually had a problem [Music] [Music] all right so we're going to wrap this up we still have to discuss the uh the contract the sheriff i do that next week uh boulevard update we have we have some more information now that we have before so everybody take that with with you the smoking on the beach i want you to think about it it's something that uh various other mayors up and down the beach are talking about if you've ever cleaned the beach you know what i'm talking about it's terrible the state of florida has made it legal to actually create a smoking ban on the beach i'm i'm not telling you to go one way or the other i'm just throwing it out there something to consider the only thing that you can't outlaw is unfiltered cigars and uh i want to discuss the unlicensed handyman and do-it-yourselfers and what you can and can't do and maybe we can get together and do something put something together to distribute out to the public because we have we have a code enforcement officer who is doing his job and i think that many people don't understand why he's doing his job so we'll discuss that next week also and uh mr mayor can i get put on the agenda connection the north alliance issue that's one of them that looks like it's going to take up four houses so there's a topic called general business just bring it up it's the same time we're going to do the work session following the special meeting we don't have a special meeting day yet okay is it possible to do that this week sometime how are we gonna set that day well if we do a work session we have to give five days i believe over a quick session okay so is our next word session thoughts so we're going to first we're going to have the special meeting and followed by the the balance of the workshop yes so you're saying we couldn't we couldn't do that this week so we just maybe set it up next time it's too late to uh to call a work session you have to i believe it's five days is that right patty um i'd have to check exactly how many days special meetings easy yeah right session it's difficult right so can we do this a special meeting by itself well you could but then we'd be committing to cleaning up two more nights i'd rather just wrap them all up so tentatively let's plan on monday you think that's possible okay great i have availability monday so just a question kyle is this your work so if you have questions we can call you yes it's combined work with vice mayor thank you thank you all right any other comments questions all in favor"
