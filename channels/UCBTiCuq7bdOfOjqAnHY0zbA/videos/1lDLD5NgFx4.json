parking space and um I've noticed that the same build up what you want to say is a walkway going up by the pillars and on the area where the Patriots are it's built up right there and I wanted to have some input from you guys if you mind if I will clean the area up and maybe get some of that sand Buck off off of our country especially on the area where the steps are is encroaching into the forefoot area where uh if you go down to the cart especially The Young Ones Will elderly folks I haven't marked on getting in and out of there and maybe that how do you feel about me um going to work myself around a shower the grass is encroaching on the area it's very limited from what it used to be and I would like your input on there thank you very much Mr radero normally we do not respond during citizen comments however at the end of the meeting the under respond for uh during city manager comments he may decide to comment on this topic also it says it's just something you would handle he would take care of is this something he would handle yes sir should I go to him but specifically to take care of something yes sir because uh I'm sorry we're having it back and forth but the city manager would be the first place to go to to get approval or to find out if maybe someone within the city would take care very well thank you next yesterday and give your name and address good evening everyone my name is Eileen sir Tiara I'd just like to introduce myself I live on 15th Street on September I was selected to represent Bellaire Beach food Miss Florida USA pageant I'm very happy and excited to be the first to Ever represent you all and I will work hard to serve my community and Inspire others to do the same thank you so much thank you very much any other comments how you all doing this evening my name is Captain TJ Luger 114 Bellaire Beach 9th Street my comments are about the Seventh Street program I just was over there the other afternoon doing some fish purchases and I realized it was an average time I looked at the ramp I walk out it's one fist deep at that water level at that time today I took photographs at average high tide for the day it was less than my knee deep it only extends nine feet out from the sea wall that's not enough to float a jet ski that's not definitely enough for an 18-foot skiff the old boat ramp always sucked at low wire but for the manager for me we've spent as a city eighty thousand dollars to cap over the sea wall and do some kind of random treatment there still no dock it's not functional whatever that is is not a functional boat ramp the ones over here go out 26 feet do you want Indian Rocks at least 22 and a half feet an 18-foot boat trailer okay it's 18 feet long that's about 20 foot trailer it's a rule of thumb is your back tires your truck hit the water edge boat should have enough water to float this would not happen even on a high tide here I'm making myself known to the city I have photos if you'd like to see them I'm kind of pissed off because that seems like a waste of money you don't build something wrong to build it right now someone's got to go back there and fix this problem and where the rent stops it drops straight into the mud tonight at 4 30 in the morning overnight will be the dead low a serious low I bet you the whole thing will be out of the water I would like to know and let someone get back to me if we what's going to be done about this because a boat ramp needs to function like a boat ramp that's all I have thank you very much other comments yes sir please come right up your name and address hi my name is Nicole Sussman I live at 98 Harbor Drive and I just wanted to talk tonight about the Ballard Beach Community Foundation and just make everyone aware of our brick program that we're starting the Flyers are on the table out in the hallway and anyone that purchases a brick will be located outside of City Hall and we'll make sure to like put all the bricks that people donate out there and this is just the order form so if you'd like to purchase one all the information is on the sheet and then also I did want to talk about this new program that we're starting it's a doctor model program it's through keep Pinellas beautiful and we're going to do a beach Fleet I'm not Beachland I'm sorry Bridge cleanup which the first one will be on the it's going to be the third Saturday of every month and it'll be January 21st is the first one at 9 00 a.m and we'll meet here at City Hall to get started and after our first Bridge cleanup then we'll be able to get one of the signs on the bridge that we're a part of so if you have any questions about that please ask anyone on the foundation board and we'll be happy to answer all of your questions thank you I do any other comments from the citizens yes or no because in Most states your name in this recipe the people and I overdrived also in the Parks and Rec board I just wanted to let everyone know about a couple events that are going to be happening we're gonna have the second annual Health Wellness Fair um on Saturday the 14th it needs to be from 10 to 2 um and we're going to have a premier Healthcare Providers providing screens information to give ways to help promote Health and Wellness in our community it also on January 19th we're gonna have a CPR class here at City Hall and you can call City Hall for more information thank you very much yes hi everyone I'm Tammy lavender 97 Harbor Drive I'm just here to also to speak a little bit about the Community Foundation as it was brought up last Monday when we were um selecting cucumber I just kind of wanted to give a state of the union and I don't really have anything to read but we started working on the foundation in March of this year so it took us like five months and there's four people right now on our board we are looking for a fifth person would be a vice chair um but up until this day our board has been financing all of the foundation so it's about two thousand dollars to get all of the paperwork through the IRS the State of Florida all of that so we do have lots of opportunities for donations or support on our website so if anybody is looking for like a last minute 2022 tax donation we would greatly appreciate it we are reaching out I have meetings set up with Duke Energy and waste management so we are seeking support through other areas but I'm more than positive that we are going to be successful we just need to get the word out but um and we're more than happy to get it started we kind of knew that's what it would be um but I just as last Monday when he got up here and I was like oh the foundation can do this and can do that like we're so in the beginning of what we're going to do like we're more than happy to take over whatever projects the city wants us to take over from an emergency advice to you know the social events so those will be moved from a park and rec board just because um it's easier to do some of the things through the foundation but until we get some Capital built up in our account we really can't do any of that so I just wanted to let everybody know that you know since March pretty much the board has been paying for everything so we would love your support if at all possible so thank you thank you any other comments from the citizens right we'll move on to agenda item number three we have a lot of law enforward please come up sir it's Sergeant McKnight thank you sir I had the October report the first page of the report there is only two assaults reported during the month of October the second page of the report there's a total of four people arrested for five separate offenses October the third page the deputy activity reports there are 791 events and it should be a better Beach during the month of October with 896 units responding to those events and for the final page correction citations there's no crashes during the month of October and there's a total of 209 accommodation citations importance thank you a question from the council yes sir Mr Roberts yeah I'm just curious what is the definition of a felony habitual traffic so that would be something along the lines of uh driving on suspended license there's a couple different ways that you can reach out status but typically it's it's you have a suspended license what you did to four or five suspensions that you've been given citations on I'm charged with then the judge will go ahead and classify you as a visual traffic violator okay thank you other questions I was crossing bridge this morning and saw that there was a Sheriff's patrol car sitting in the median and apparently someone was coming down that Hill ride but ramp tooth fast and I was amazed he was able to turn that car around and stop the speaker so a nice job on that I do have one question about the concealed carry firearm would that be maybe they pulled the car over and there was a gun in the car yes sir that was actually Perez's case I believe in the beginning of the month of October he stopped the person make it over us on a traffic offense and inside the car between driver's seat and the center console of the particles the handgun that was not properly stores thank you any other questions or comments [Music] thank you Sergeant I appreciate it except yeah code enforcement report good evening Mr mayor council officials staff and citizens Deputy clapko for the record uh if you saw in the blog that I submitted for the month of November uh still busy we're really going after a lot of these ordinance violations with the brush and the bushes um I'm getting a lot of compliance one of the things that you'll probably notice in there is usually we give a five day notice but I've been giving everybody 15 or better because of the holidays and trying to get somebody out to take care of the issues out of these homes um the it's been working out real well um I'm compliant or compiling a list for the city manager and let him seeing where actually where we were stopped actually given the notices and when the when the jobs are done so we're hopefully we're in the right direction to start in January again um it's kind of I'm going to try to drop it back down to the five or ten day notices and kind of push the citizens to get this done but one of the complaints that I get is trying to hire somebody in maybe two or three days before they get a return phone calls so uh I usually give my business cards and if you have any questions please feel free to give me a call or my email address and that's been working out well I've been getting some emails saying that people are getting work done or they've got somebody coming out to give the uh the estimates and get the work done so other than that that's about it I'll stand for any questions cancel it here are we doing anything about the dangling lift that's oh that's one of the things I discussed with the city manager that we are going to um get with him and tell him to get he needs to get that reoccurred because of the issue with that vote because when it uh during the tropical storm Nicole kind of went out into the Intracoastal rusted up in in Sand Key and then drifted down and we finally got it down off of Belle Isle and talking with the marine officer it's been a little bit of an issue trying to get that boat out of the water um I've been off for the last few days I don't know if it's still there or not but the Marine unit was taken care of it but yes we will address that yes yes I will tell you I have another house on the leader that we've been working on this for six months to get uh her her lift repair and it's it's an issue with supplies permits and everything else but we will we will take care of I was happy to see the focused on clothing and found something you know um yeah it was partially submerged the last time I saw it but and I haven't heard from the Murray Deputy yet the weather has been pulled out of water thank you I have a question whenever uh someone does receive a quote and they're given a time delay and they show you that quote the next time you come around they're sort of reset the clock for them yes sir what I'll do is if somebody says hey they can't come out for another three weeks I understand you know and uh if we get a complaint on it then I'll address it with whoever is the complaint you're just like oh yeah we're good to decide because one of the issues we had was down on uh 1037 and it took a while but we finally got that house cleaned up I have one more question what is silt that's right there the silt fences are the black fabric fences that go around Lots okay and technically if they're doing work there those fences have to be up to eliminate the burrito on out if the house support the lot it's vacant and they're not doing any construction we can have them remove those until construction starts all right and do you uh do you pay attention to the uh I'm just asking questions the drain guards purpose anything from going in it it's supposed to eliminate uh the city manager back me up on this it's supposed to eliminate certain things going down into the sewer system such as rocks and those types of things so it's just supposed to build their water through it okay that's it Council talk about a sole patine so I was down the 12th and 13th Street I got a couple of friends who are complaining about the new construction and there's no silt socks on any of those new drains that are going in there and you can actually see some of the degree already that being you [Music] I can I'll take care tonight I believe they saw that whole system plugged okay I'll check on that thing anyone else thank you very much Merry Christmas all right we're up to item four which is the City attorney reporter Peach Memorial thank you mayor and Council first and foremost congratulations in our first meeting it was an exciting moment I uh I don't have anything major to report except to say that it has been a pleasure joining this body in the middle of the year and working through our first year together I commend the efforts we've taken the meaningfully advanced policy and this is in this body in these Chambers and if there's anything as we go into the next year expect to see some of the issues we've discussed the administrative elements of the vessel institution ordinance which Administration will handle um the the sign code ordinance and other similar and also a legislative session that I'm sure will have plenty of fun surprises for us to adapt and so with that thank you for the opportunity to work for you with you and I look forward to the next year I have to answer any questions we have thank you Mr Bullock for the council all right thank you very much I appreciate it and how we are on to item number five the city manager's report we have a city manager everyone Mr reefer thank you mayor council let's start off with the 12th and 13th Street project that still has a January completion day but we'll most likely see more than 90 percent to era they have all the pipe installed including the additional employment that we approved we need November meeting they have some Assad driving a respiration to do better including the valley curve but we're getting very close they're in the middle of the middle of the road and lay the asphalt within a couple weeks so you're very close on that project the all of our Underground good news there is the Duke agreement and invoices finalized for phase one but in the process we received additional credits and a total for phase one phase two over about 440. 100 000 without any credit so phase one was credited an additional 162 000 that is good because the original cost was about 1.1 million an hour under a million if you remember when we did the presentation about Walmart underground and we were talking about the deficit project was in um these credits in a sense the the arbor mottied eight hundred two thousand dollars is covering that additional but we need to complete the underground project so I kind of want to send covering the interview um they are still working on easements where they can give them if they cannot obtain an easement then it's going to be equivalent to people for the extra right away whatever the Savage Street program cyber security seat belong 16th Street C1 the sea walls are complete the boat ramp is complete I was being aware this week of an issue with the program the engineer designed it with a wheel stop and even the ramp that has been proven repeated it's going to be more of a problem for that organ use of it basically at a time it's previous perhaps so we I already associate engineer we're going to eliminate that real stuff and I will look into that drop off that was mentioned earlier in systems comments we still have to get the fishing knives so that may be something can be taken care of while we're doing about this stuff the six the same thing with 16 so you can see while that is complete all the weeds of backfill and the city staff will be doing the Cyber restoration with those projects the 17th and 18th Street the DMP Stillwater proven project we had a meeting with this DAC before we further this discussion we have one concern uh involving both the storm water fund and mechanical Brothers one as it relates to the loan uh chair of the CAC was organic and I have a plan to meet with uh with the bank until tomorrow and to discuss what the qualifications would be relating to those ones the code enforcement analysis we're moving forward with our quadrant plan that we presented like like Steve mentioned earlier we are focusing in on some of the most important and uh most frequently seen items around that water report and you're also tackling some of the frequently seen items that maybe weren't as ranked as high but they are still um static codes that the city needs to go through routine and make sure people are within those codes so that's where we're at right now I've been blogging the daily directors that were given to Steve and we are performing reports we will report back to the city hall generator last time I think it was a meeting ago I I told you that the source local has gone up a council member or Banker recommended they're looking to use generator option I did speak to the main company uh General app that I was dealing with they said that they do have used options but with warranties they do not opening sheets for those I did reach out to CAD and I'm trying to get more information on various options follow for that City Hall Seawall based on the current price per foot we're well under budget so I think we need to hold on that project we've been experiencing some corrosion out there but I think that it's not a thing that needs to be taken care of but tomorrow and if you have some time but that's something that you should have applied for about it the Gulf of Mexico food replacement we passed the ordinance um I get out with the FWC working through the whole apartment process has been extremely helpful um I've pretty much compiled their whole application I'm waiting for the necessary approval from fdp and the US Supreme Court of Engineers before I could submit the application to make sure that I have everything the way they want it and then I will order the movies and play them installing them the Morgan Park parking lot of restoration are about the stuff there's a dinner budget we had to uh Mill and resurface the parking lot it's giving up in Russia over the years my plan is to have some estimates to present to you in January agenda um walking into the survey that came back I mean we did very well um big thank you with Parks and Recreation board a lot of effort and just just uh Distributing those surveys to all the residents that went door-to-door got a lawn mowers also been one of any other needs and uh I forwarded those results up to you and I've also put them on the City website for the uh just for the citizens that are here would you give us a brief summary of that survey because they may not know what the outcome is if you haven't seen the results of the survey it was heavily weed in each who was for the project of Paving the Locking easement throughout the city there was about 80 to 20 um for the most part better products to be spending with that kind of money for um but if you can see the exact results if you go to the city website on the very front page and say well who needs to the survey and it lays out all the uh the statistics for the three questions and all the comments that were made and then kill the playground that's still on for so many people to come in um I did get in touch with a youth playground company in the areas like Easter display sets and they might just um you know allow us to like they could remove the Playset for us to take that off our status hands and um 500 so this book is the same completes that but they'll take care of that that much and you asked me to um to reach out to the property owner of the tree in a Harbor Drive in a street I did get in touch with that probably I'm going to fix a little bit to find this telephone number but if you have a number for him he is agreeable not that he's going to pay to remove industry but he'd be able to have the tree removed so that's not where we're at this point um the CCC you can move that set back to the cover where the paper there is and uh as far as the holidays coming up we have um the building will be closed for Christmas Eve Christmas holiday and New Year's New Year's holiday so the little can close at 12 23 into Friday 12 26th to Monday at 12 30 to Friday and the second of the new year which is a Monday the normally our state council meeting will be on that Monday sweet day for the January Council thank you a couple of things on the 12th Street beach access uh you said you're going to look into that there's three benches there um another bench there um two of the advantages are one bench is completely loses both it's Foundation there's no nothing holding it down the other one is three quarters of the way going um you know I was out there a couple of citizens said they would participate volunteer the cleanup area but if you remember Kyle the previous city manager had a problem with the coats and everything like that and I said don't anyone touch anything until when that happened we kind of back off on the name to someone I had been touching fdp since we've moved some of the same back at the 19th Street access because it wasn't coaching heavily and I've been working with them on what we cannot do I think we should be completely and I guess the question is citizens should be out there donating until I would recommend that we have the city staff here all right and the Boat Rental Center Street is going forward right the boat Rapids Iowa state is complete we have to take care of that we'll stop uh issue because it presents more of a with such a low tide and a whole water there you really need to but during like meeting below times or get a trailer well off of that ramp um the old the ramp allowed for them because of that because the sliding them on into the soap and you could continue it back the engineer when they designed it put it on that meal stop it was an older study on that Mr hooker helped make clear that it would present a problem I felt the engineer today and discuss how I believe that and the doc would be put back shortly the doc if approved tonight I told you that going as soon as possible thank you thank you yes Robert still on the 7th Street um uh boat ramp so just make sure I understand so the old boat ramp extended out to distance X so the new program does it extend x minus some footage or did it go to exactly the same point or further based on the common for the citizen from what I could sell because when we were measuring the old program I've walked out there like I said the silk and sand that washed up probably about six feet off the edge of the seam all so you could trace concrete to about six feet and then you'd start going down a couple inches into the same type of feel more concrete we we estimated that a 10 feet would give us a blowout where eventually that that sediment would come back in um so it would be enough ramp to get out to where you would be um I guess the blood sand so um when they when they did the slab they had the dredge set it back so there is it does drop off but that is something that may be able to be adjusted once you take that yourself off so that at least that ramp will get you down to where where the settlement is and then from there you're going to take it as far as you can because I can go to the trailers okay so that is something to take a look at with the engineering firm that perhaps it may be beneficial to go ahead and extend it even further so that even when we have a low tide we're going to be able to have a boat launch and not have an issue I will check with the engineers my it's my understanding that if we extend that that slab it's going to be very so it's going to be very like silt that yeah naturally very much okay so yeah I think we can we um you know because there's nothing there's been having that drop off right I think we could adjust the trailer below the edge of that concrete and it could cause half the time to get both back on the trailer so um you're suggesting you'll try to fill that void in yes so there you go about the question reveals is The Edge higher than what it was before the engineering contractors told me that they had to remove the slab and then put it back on the quarterback in it was inspected by the engineers so I trust that that's what happened that's what was supposed to happen all right okay they'd like to give everyone else the opportunity yeah go ahead go ahead it's fun it'll be fine okay all right on the generator so from everybody's history here I'm just curious over time in the past how often has this particular building lost power intermittently a couple hours since I've been here during our holiday never lost power and maybe might have been down a couple hours ago it could depending on the Storm sure sure I understand like with the generator I worked with many many years and all of our buildings had backup generator support but at the same time I think with our budget we need to think through you know what do we really need here and as long as you're as you're buying a used generator based on this record's recommendation as long as we're exercising those generators you know on a consistency once a week once a month we used to do this all the time so we wanted to make sure that it's operating correctly and so that when you need it that's when you need it and we don't understand it so um I I guess from the infrequency that we've had any issues here it's hard to really justify the dollars for a brand new generator although somebody who supplies those would want to convince us otherwise so there's there's multiple opportunities out there I believe to be able to use generator that we could bring on board and as long as we're exercising it and we're supposed to and basically running it once a week to make sure that when we need it it's ready to roll I think that would be fine whether or not we have a warranty or not you know you get a such a low price I believe there's a lot of organizations that sometimes will just donate those like the state we'll just say hey we're done with this one you guys want it you can have it so those are things that possibly pursue to see what we've come across I just have to take a look at that right and they'd still have to build it up to the 12 foot so I'll make it correct directions yeah so it's out of the water let's see at least 10 years I'll get the exact date we did a lot of work I took a lot of pictures of it um that I was going to present to you just the condition of it we discussed it um yeah I think we can share a chance that when you yeah when you bring it to a work session or whatever that would be for you okay thank you anyone else have questions also um the boat ramp back to that again I hate to keep bringing it up but uh it's not open right now is that correct okay and we're going to make sure that once it is open and it's hard around it's not something that's going to see because the logo's in there and they have to drag it out it's not okay so I just I want to make sure we're I know it's kind of a hassle to delay reopening the ramp and we want to make sure that it's right and safe uh as far as the generator is concerned I had a comment on that also the right kind of maintenance program if you have a good practical company who's taking care of it and it's an older generator that we're fine we um we've had to rely on it maybe twice in in four years but it Cycles it emails and changing the oil changing batteries things like that it's not cheap filling up the water is generator like that but a certainly cheaper than buying brand name so um I like the comment about the tree that's that'll be a nice conversation to have with the surrounding neighbors to see if they're interested in maybe doing something with that and uh the last thing I was at the board of League of cities conference this weekend or actually last week and I found out that they have a grant assistance program are you aware of that yes okay and are we a member of it if we signed up and even considered looking into what they have available to us I believe we are but I will demonstrate because it's my understanding that uh over half the municipalities in Florida are members of that great program and uh they're supposed to be very well versed at uh directing you towards grants that you may not be aware of okay and and they did they claim that even for municipalities like ours or businesses and we're pretty much a private Community there are some available we've got some occasions that's it for me I forgot to thank you I was probably a rich pain in the butt I'll say goodbye but they should I really appreciate you looking in there and taking care of America any other comments from the counselor One More Mr Roberts um first I want to thank you for the long list of projects because that helps us understand everything that's going on so that's great there is one one thing that wasn't on the list that I don't know I don't know if it would be something for you to address or something for Randy or grass I know I received an email I did read it I didn't probably spend a lot of time delving into it but I know there was a religious group that was within our city and the end result was some type of a legal response on that organization but either of you two trying to give us just a quick recap regarding what happened sure uh quick recap problem solved slightly more detailed recap there was a religious organization a Candace in your community door-to-door there is plenty of case law providing that for religious organizations political organizations and the like sort of those bastions of free speech we often think of that campus and borgador is permitted without the need for a permit your code is in line with that constitutional case law and it has while it may require a permits for certain forms of solicitation that kind of canvassing is specifically carved out from a permit requirement they somebody had approached some of the canvassers suggesting they may need a permit or they should check the city hall to inquire about getting a permit that they in response to that that was what that organization's legal department said today hey we're sure this was an oversight but please be advised there is legal Authority on that we are already confirmed before that correspondence came through we did not know that that correspondence was coming but it was by the time we received it it was functionally mood because the city never once took any action um on that issue or specifically Discord insurance without them to get a permit so it's it was sort of uh it was it ended up being a non-issue ultimately but it was it was resolved and just as a general matter whether it's members of the public the commission or otherwise if you're if there's ever a question or a concern on what our codes allow or provide for on the person tasked with giving you folks that legal advice and what and what we'll do about what our codes say is is Kyle's role so please spread those concerns to Kyle if there's a you know any concern about approaching someone saying hey in Bel Air Beach we don't do that sort of thing whatever that's what they might be that's where Kyle Deputy Clapton and their team to to resolve but that was how that worked out okay thank you I want that issue I think I respond to you Mr Moore and Kyle and I wanted to watch tower case because right my previous work background non-profit organizations have a lot of leeway especially religious students whether it becomes the religious waiver or whatever not saying that this organization was trying to set you set us up but there's a lot of organizations that are out there there are some that will uh this theirs was in response to a specific um interaction they had by the time we meet correspondents uh the manager and I had already conferred on the issue and agreed no one actually would be taken thank you I have a comment on that or a question actually I thought that they sent us a preemptive letter they were warning Us in advance before they ever arrive is that not the case that's not my understanding of the facts and my understanding of the facts was the letter was sent in response to an interaction they sent the sheriff because I share a sheriff they have a sheriff order they're going to all the United States and uh I appreciate everyone not for responding to my accidental fat finger reply that's a great job but we did give you 10 minutes exactly is that it Council all right thank you very much great job thank you all right now we are on to the city clerks report this Gentry you

counts and establishing effective date this has been a reading of resolution 2022-110 by title 1. thank you very much Mr Laura I'm going to do things a little different than I normally have in the past and the reason why is because I realized that if we if we have a motion for any agenda item uh then the citizens never had the opportunity to speak on it and we clearly state if it's not an agenda item you're not allowed to speak and I look at it as we were keeping the citizen from speaking so before I ask for a motion I would like to go to this and for comments on the side we will be doing this for Citizens all right do I have a motion to approve coordinates 20 to 2022-10 motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second by the way Stephen Tarot all right uh Frank you have the floor this is typical I believe the last Council session we moved to have both council members being able to authorize checks it was not going to be used as a manager and worked out some of the work that really fine I think we should look forward Council I agree and since there are no other comments uh let's go ahead and take a vote this is to approve resolution 20 22-10 tagging could

the storm water on Appropriations by dedicating loans received through the American Rescue plan act and establishing an effective date whereas the city council of City Valley Beach adopted resolution 2022-06 on Monday September 19 2022 adopting the 2022-2023 budget and we're at a sports statute 166.24177 provides the governing body between this penalty at any time within a fiscal year or within 60 days following the end of this would be your main event a budget for the for that year in the same manner as the original budget unless otherwise specified in the mutinous power lease Charter and whereas the 2022-2023 festival your budget must be amended to dedicate the funds received from the coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds program and part of the American Rescue plan act to storm water improvements in the storm fund now there are four being resolved by the city council of the Bellaire Beach Florida Section 1 to the city of Bellaire Beach annual budget for the following fund shall be amended as describe over the attached budget adjustment request is an a to this resolution and section two this resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption as budget resolution has been read in full uh on first year reading and only reading resolution number 2022-15 thank you very much Mr Moore about a Target summary but hey we'll accept the entire resolution let's continue these citizens for comments as there are no comments from the citizens who I have a motion to approve resolution 2022-11 so the motion to move uh motion made by Mike saber do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley I might say yes as you can see by the city manager report of the additional funds I recommend uh approval anyone else I have a I guess a statement and that is the accountant didn't give us any backup information as to where those funds that were originally in the budget to fund this where are they going to be placed are they just going to be a limo until we decide what to do with them I know we talked about using them for undergrounding and it seems like we should have the offsetting entry here reflected in this um so the way she had it was she had um the funding was more on a uh unearned revenue and she's moving in she's dedicated to stormwater and typically with the stormwater fund and the new project we moved monies from better that are unassigned into that final application paper things so we're taking that money that was the unearned for dedicating it to someone I mean for accounting purposes because it's a lot easier if we keep it all in one fund so that in turn the money that we had saved and budgeted for those projects that were entertain this using this money that money will be available um if you're want to make a note about how I will um it is offset because the idea would be that um you know if you wouldn't be under two thousand so in order to pay for that project and we would free up money for Capital products one which would be done and then the reasoning behind not applying to undergoing examples because we have a lot of reimbursements in the county involved in that and it's going to make the accounting law s I understand and I think that we need to go on record to say that 802 000 is going to be used for underground and nothing else and that's where I have a problem what they go in a general fund for I mean this is a project we agreed we would all focus on doing both phases of the project contingent on some of these funds and some future funds with the 443 000 that we have additionally received from we've got to do some some adjustments that were made or I mean we're pretty close to having that project funded and I want to make sure that we have those funds dedicated whether through notation or some other means or whatever that looks like but and I may look at the council for uh or some advice there but we I don't know if the we need each and amended but I I want something included in the in the agreement that those funds will be dead okay turning more of it a resolution now I I was a little confused about this also okay but those are the mentioned exhibit a and what we received as exhibitors doesn't that lock it in that order amended amending it for the storm water system yes you're dedicating the art of funds to stormwater because it that is in the qualified expense okay I'm not really sure about clarification so the um we had eight hundred two thousand dollars in the budget to pay for so long now those funds are available for the future projects we talked about those funds being used specifically for the underground along Gulf Boulevard so I want to make sure that that's what we talk about that and that those funds don't get pushed to another project so should this actually this this Arbor funding has to go to the storm water system it's the money we're dedicated so there should actually be another line in this to make this complete where we're moving money from the storm water system to the undergrounding project my advice at this stage is I understand things and if I miss mischaracterizing please let me know my understanding is this resolution deals with the dedication and I understand the point council member vice mayor Shirley is making is that okay but then what happens to the money that displaces where does that go if that needs to be addressed or if this Council would like to see that address that can be done by subsequent budget amendment weekend and a bunch of them it can be done in a January meeting if need be given that this water Molly or a team or not present this evening to resolve or address further inquiry as to how they're handling that on the books we can definitely make sure in following the meeting that uh manager reefler advises for that of that Insight of the commission or the council has that hey we've always had the understanding that once this money came through or the money would be dedicated to this other purpose and we can further amend the budget to address the secondary purpose the primary purpose here is to make sure that we are signaling to any parties agencies or otherwise that hey we're complying we know the way that this money can be used and we're dedicated to that what that does internally for our other monies we can resolve through additional resolution and the way we would address this is apply some strange chance see the manager Reaper did not add this as an agenda item for a new resolution for next month's meeting one of us could certainly do it provided that resolution is necessary I'm sort of assuming that there's there's abilities to move within funds so depending on if a resolution is necessary in the first place then we will have one if it's simply yes we've changed the Ledger because you can move within funds right we're not going to fix the dog park anymore we're going to fix the bocce ball park you can that's all parks and rec budget it's just how you're using it so if those are within the same fun lines and I just don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of the line items in your budget document to say what funds each thing resides in but if a budget amendment is necessary we can provide one and if one's necessary and that's not done we work at your pleasure other council members yeah I'm a little confused because this money is covered money whatever it has to be specifically used for this phone number okay so if you put it in the way it's written and we're over funded of course you have through the Constitution you can amend the budget but if the intention is to move it right now I think that's fraud uh I I think that's something that that understanding is is more of a misunderstanding and it's sort of the idea of if you have five dollars in your pocket and you say hey when my Dad gives me five bucks then I'm gonna go to the movies but that's this is a federal allocation of money to Our intention right now is to move this money right into right into underground which is not that's that's not what this is doing this is this is moving it directly into the storm water fungi right but what's what was proposed was I believe the idea is we're going to take this money and then use it for underground no I don't know and that's why I say it's a misunderstanding it's a the challenges you're dealing with fungible Goods money it's sort of a legal construct of which eight hundred thousand dollars we're talking about we're talking about these 800 000 will be used in one way and by virtue of this influx of 800 000 we can spend 800 000 another way is the point in the surveys vice mayor Shirley is making it but that's that's a that's a topic for another name correct which is why which is what the advice idea is what I'm saying I think we're in agreement saying saying similar things different purpose by putting it on the record now I don't know where that stands legally I'm and I'm here to advise you that legally it stands that we are okay to adopt this resolution codify a trip as written that's all going on tonight and then the person whose job it is to make sure we stay within Financial compliance will analyze and advise appropriate thank you any other comments from the council Vice May Shirley are you satisfied with this answer all right let's uh take this to a vote this is to approve resolution 2022-11

literally be hazardous it's the one uh just over the bridge as you go into Harrison and I know I've asked in the past that we could look at lighting the bridge on Harrison Avenue it's extremely dark and several times I've had to kind of jump out of the way of cars because they can't see pedestrians on the bridge so if we can kind of look at that I think I actually don't do about it and they never responded so I've got them to do on everything thank you again I'm like playing contributed to the advancement in my parking Recreation board along with the city staff the great event I see everyone
