    "transcript": "good evening everyone it is Monday May the 22nd 2023 and the Bellaire Beach city council work session will now come before so please rise and join me in Pledge of Allegiance I play my belief is still alive in the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice are all the council member Frank Banker here council member of Belinda Livingstone here council member Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Mike zabel here vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle riefler pioneer City attorney Randy Moore president we have a it looks like small agenda but it's actually kind of big so let's just go ahead and get started with item number one uh which is to review the 2023 comprehensive plan review recommendations and planning and zoning Awards more thank you so the city has been working on its comprehensive plan amendments as part of its regular cycle for doing so let's zoom out a little bit Beginning by explaining what the comprehensive plan is I know we've touched on this in the past but your comprehensive plan is like your Constitution and your Land Development regulations your ordinances on Land Development are like the laws and statutes that flow from it you cannot build in a community in a manner that is inconsistent with a comprehensive plan subject to some things Tallahassee has done of late and so um that's it that's that is to say a comprehensive plan is a critical document it is your visioning document it's what bounds the development and Aesthetics and all the other elements of your community in a broader way a comprehensive plan ordinarily has to be Revisited and revised every seven years we are on that interval and so playing a slight bit of catch up but getting it done I've been meeting with myself Kyle Patty and Linda Fisher from Ford Pinellas have met with the Planning and Zoning Board on on at least three different occasions to discuss revisit and revise this and what you have before you is the draft that Ford Pinellas has produced based on recommendations from the planning and zoning boards and housekeeping that had to be done as well as some updates that are mandated by the legislature of language that you must have in your comprehensive plan the cliff notes version of that is some of the housekeeping amendments were updating data and Analysis for the community such as your population figures projections updating the maps and such as the future land use map and boundaries updating your schedule with Capital Improvements to reflect your current priorities established priorities on updating some other definitions of terminology some of the the more substantive amendments that you'll find in there in terms of the amount of strikethroughs and underlines attended to them really have to to do with bringing this comprehensive plan draft into Conformity with three specific Florida Statutes the first being the parallel flood act from 2015 which requires local governments to address topics such as repetitive flood damage and sea level rise Bert J Harris private property well within the Burke Harris act the private property rights act in 2021 sort of attended to that the legislature thought it important that communities memorialize in their comprehensive plans a series of property rights that exist but just sort of I guess an ethos or mission statement so this new element is added in this draft another is there is a bit of a hat tip to an act adopted this year the local act otherwise being colloquially referred to as the affordable housing act that had passed this session one of the things in there is says that affordable housing can be built in certain manners notwithstanding any local ordinance regulation or resolution or other Rule and so we at least acknowledge that the existence of that act and the comp plan there are other attendant restrictions on what affordable housing is and isn't what kind of property can be developed on and you don't have that in your community at present so not a huge concern but just at least acknowledging that language there were some things that were discussed in the code that planning Zodi there was one topic that Planning and Zoning discussed and on my advice and otherwise declined to raise which was the acknowledgment of or provision for a motel hotel type structures within the within the community or uses I should say more than structures and there was a concern on depending on how far down you go that road do you erode your transient lodging short-term rental restrictions and so that that was abandoned based on a concern of that so that did not make the draft some of the proposed amendments that they did address was recognition of the importance of the Bellar Beach Marina you're planning and zoning I'm calling it your Planning and Zoning it's they're wearing the Hat of the land planning agency if you're if you're tracking the statutes that way but recognizing the importance of the Bellar Beach Marina with new policies proposed to state that the city desires to keep the marina as a Marina and prioritize its use for residents as feasible when you're talking about a comprehensive plan the kind of language you draft is is aspirational typically especially when you're talking about objectives and goals you're not talking in in the same way that you would a Land Development regulation like and the skateboard shop closed captioning not available [Music] [Music] and then they addressed a few minor issues including newer revised policies uh regarding Manatee protection regulation of e-bikes exploring new funding again they didn't outright regulate those things but those are some of the topics they touched on so you have the document before you in full this is a workshop this is not the first hearing on this we there is a draft ordinance attended to this process and and you will see that but before we prepared an ordinance for this body to consider on first reading we wanted to make sure you'd seen the output of that body and also just by way of further education while you continue to peruse those documents the comprehensive plan adoption process is a little different than your average ordinance usually we have a first reading second reading we're done there's a little bit of a flow chart up and down where we do a first reading we send it to Fort Pinellas they say yeah we're good and then it goes on to Tallahassee tell has these division of Economic Opportunity kind of gives it their own blessings says okay you can move to your second step so if you see if you see this understand that there's there's a little more bureaucracy involved in this particular kind of amendment because it is a big deal it is your comprehensive plan um but I'm just while you looked at it I want to make sure you're also aware of some of that process so that's what you have before you tonight the workshop the the ask from staff is whether individually or collectively you had any concerns in the draft that have been circulated to you and Advance the meeting anything that you were wondering why is it this way or how can we address it I I can't profess I I will tell you I did not draft this document specifically this has been prepared this is a planner's mind a planner's view I've certainly looked at it and reviewed it but if there are things that are cred that are that are a little more nuanced I may say you know we can we can look to that and have get that follow-up from staff on that from the fort Pinellas side but again just looking for if there were any concerns questions comments and the draft as it presently exists anything I missed there Kyle not at all right question concerning the power forward analysis I would flip the Paradigm of the question it's not an authority we are self-governing as much as Tallahassee allows us to anymore um but this is this is a collaborative process they've been our partner through this process we have an interlocal agreement with Fort Pinellas wherein this and other measures they provide planning services to us we don't have a separately contracted planner and so this was not there this was not by decree from them that this is what you must do this was the input of your board the Ford Pinellas inputs in this process were largely just the Florida statute statutory compliance and Conformity they are the Metro Metropolitan planning organization and there's certainly some things we have to do that have to align with that but um as it relates to this particular draft I'm not aware of any you know edicts that they decreed shall be adopted by the city and sorry that's just the way forward and else as it goes that wasn't really how this drafting process worked to my knowledge Council I guess it's a question for both yous you read over the documentary I'm sure you've both read over the document a few times what is in there that we can't live with right pressure have you been able to really adjusted this or you know it looks like you'll complying with everything already yeah I didn't I didn't see anything the stuff that was mandated looking in there and it was just the learning that they required and um kind of things that the planning zoning board talked about or just in their minds what what the city the focus on I there's nothing I think again the perhaps I need to do a better job of articulating this is your policy document this is a planning document this is yours no I understand it and and when I say that is there's not some um external decree I don't think there's anything in here that you can't live with I think a lot of it is consistent with what you're already doing as you've sort of alluded to part of what I would say you're this is more rather than an imposition this is more an opportunity if and that's not just lawyer spin this is an opportunity to say hey if there's something on the horizon that we feel we need to address here and say this is the direction we want to take this community from a land planning perspective this is a great time to do it but I don't think with the exception of things you just can't change like putting in regardless of how you feel about them putting in nine rules about private property rights you might not feel like we need them in there we got to do it anyways but it doesn't change anything we're doing or not doing because it's just the law um it's how property rights work in America um so in this in this particular case to answer your question I don't think there's anything you can't live with um because and that's in part because I don't think there's a lot of it's being imposed I think the hardest thing if I had to answer your question with anything I think it's the limits of a community and a County that are as densely populated and interrelated as you are here because a lot of the frustration that the planning and zoning and LPA came across and like I really want to say this it's like well we can't quite do that because we can't dictate what happens in Clearwater Beach in the bridges so you know we can't say and a bridge another Bridge shall be built you know from here to Siesta Key or something like that you just it may be what we want that's one not how this kind of document functions but also the limits of what we do yeah and the reason I said because you said you know we may couple work sessions on this but if it's might be useless I mean oh I wasn't suggesting work sessions this might be the only one if you're if you guys don't really have a lot of feedback I just the first reading and second reading I just didn't see anything you could live with or what we're not doing already yes sir that was the question oh I appreciate it questions I just want to be clear today any changes or modifications are highlighted on here we can quickly scan through it so that everyone's you know aware of that we're not reviewing this entire course it's entirely yes they are in strike through an underlying format in fact I think you can call it out in another color Beyond just straight through yeah um so it is made so that you can skim and see if something jumps out of you and that's all we're we're asking certainly not making the ass that you go unless you desire to as a body go Page by Page you certainly enjoy that discretion but in a broader sense I will tell you um I I know this kind of is well known in this community but I I give my hats off to your subordinate boards they really spend a lot of time with this document they did go Page by Page like three times on on three separate occasions and revisiting that so they did a lot of the heavy lifting which I think is part of why it seems may seem easier now um but again as you folks are the ultimate legislative body or governing body here it's um you know again just making sure that whatever where they were tracking is where you wish to go okay and I'm looking at that seems correct to me I I don't know if some of it I'm seeing some things that are bold so I'm not sure if those move but yes that looks like new tech stuff which uh page out of the 44 you want just because there's objectives get renumbered again as you move second for stage number 23 23. thank you [Applause] this is the parallel session yeah this is and so by way of example this is one of those statutory inputs that we have to put into the flood Peril um statute and that's why where you see things that are not just one isolated section on a page more likely than not you're dealing with um regulatory mandates there and so that is a mandate that we we don't have a lot of flexibility with and did you see any red flags in this Edition meet uh I I did not one thing I was particularly careful to review and I would certainly review again before we get to any kind of first and second reading is making sure there's nothing that could be construed so as to touch on your transient rental a short-term rental regulation languages as some kind of interpreted receiving from that I know that is not the policy direction of this body at this stage so I I will look at that again but I looked at it a few times I did not see anything that could be construed in that in fact the language was specifically massaged or addressed you know in that way to make sure that was not on not at issue otherwise I no I did not see any red flags and I think you know like to my point answering your first question mayor um staff with Ford Pinellas was very responsive to comments and concerns from the LBA in a few instances there was language in there that either wasn't really doing too much or like I don't love that it says this do we have to do this you don't have to do that and if you don't if it doesn't align with your community even though it was in your comp plan last time around take it out if you really want and so that was you know those kind of recommendations were heated 1.11. okay insurance program Community rating system blah blah blah so now we're lobbyists or State award and again I'll have to in the meantime I will pull up the parallel flood act to see if that language is directly from the statute I believe it is 26. I actually got stuck on the term uh to achieve flood insurance premium discounts I think we're receiving discounts these days you want to start me no yeah maximum we just got our research for class six which was 20 discount yeah now it's tough to see on everybody's policies there I mean if we didn't participate in the program we would see the difference yeah that's some strong language especially when you see every municipality around us is receiving the same document again I can I can that's one topic we can certainly um follow up with and see what portion of that language is statutory mandate how much of that is language trying to capture the essence of a statutory mandate if it's the latter then that will give us some flexibility but for example with the private property rights language which is not what we're discussing it is a script it says put these words in your compliment um I don't I'm not as intimately familiar as uh with the flood Parallax to know if that's the case Ms Fisher will be here for the first reading she just it was just a timing issue for the workshop tonight fortinellas does plan to attend the actual um ordinance hearings to facilitate this process but between now and then I can get that information from where I'm doing Google searches now but I don't want to hinder you moving through your agenda that I subject to my ability to find it on the Fly that's that's fine I just uh just want to make sure that these Shadows are actually what they what they have to now means you have to and uh that's a little troubling right there because what's the next message so uh that's my comment there's actually Senator Scott who's the mayor is proposing a bill this week to offset the national flood insurance program and bring in more private insurers which I think is going to make it even worse because it's going to be like a Citizens Fallout but so it may inflict with federal policy that will other comments questions from the Council on this I think I'm just talking about that 1.11 so Kyle is there anything in there that we're not currently doing I think we are doing one of those things regarding the factors because I think the city to do those things oh it was very it was for this city to to influence other communities around us but then it doesn't say shout out it says encourage I think naturally I do in person program and the CRS but I'm going to understand what the strength of language I also understand sometimes Thailand asks you guys the first time that's true coordinate when I was in Pinellas County importance of planning to the church playing for pedestrian's bicycle paths of bicycle primary design standards are employer industry so I mean we have that on it's called Boulevard but has that been require us to providing tourism yeah that's not ours right so right but we took a bike pass on 20th Street what does that mean you tell me well I I will tell you as a visioning statement no it doesn't compel you to ensure there's a bike lane on every road and art or wait artery in their Community it compels you to collaborate and we can collaborate and then determine it's not feasible it's not necessary it's not but at least be open to that General sense and I you'll see a lot of those shells with those it without outside of the 1.11 which I understand you're concerned with and we can see if that's mandatory language but in a planning document like this there was some discussion for example during the LPA meeting about it says we shall provide for transportation facilities and we're not going to be building we're not part of PSTA we're not looking to be building bus shelters and this and but transportation facility is your roadways your sidewalks your walking paths your bike paths you guys spend a lot of time talking about pedestrian paths over the last year and so you're doing that yeah and it's not always the most narrow construct of what the what that terminology is and so no one's ever looked at a comp plan it says you have to build these things it's more it's more what it doesn't provide for that becomes the bigger issue for you as a community and and to add to that we are cooperating and communicating with it because we're asking questions reasonable solutions to help and understand your participation in The Big C your participation in the mayor's Council your efforts with Ford Pinellas otherwise on their board and looking at the tourist development tax involvement all those things that counts that's all part of that collaboration the fact that you've reached different conclusions doesn't mean you failed to cooperate you folks are very involved in your community especially in your community at large and your neighboring jurisdictions and trying to find collaborative Solutions I think you check more of those boxes than you might realize or give yourself credit for because it doesn't necessarily mean that you seed your autonomy to them it just means you're willing to see if we can work together to a better tomorrow you know whatever tagline you wish to put on anything else Council no so we'll commit to follow up on the objective that you provide what's the next move to bring us into an ordinance Mr Mayor yes yes and that ordinance is prepared it was an entire subject to your input um so the one thing that we Kyle and I will follow up with um Miss Fisher and her team at Fort bennell's to see what what flexibility we have with that language and what an alternative language might look like if we can do that um and then we would bring a draft to you as promptly as practical subject to notice Provisions when you're amending the comp plan there's enhanced no requirements and advertising requirements so that would be that's the only thing that's going to limit our how quickly you see it next we're not agency sounded weird I like to see what it is yeah let's take away our opinions and uh that's a little Troublesome but for the most part everything else looks like housekeeping and you're going to check into language yes sir yeah as soon as advertising and other legal requirements will allow for it yesterday and uh just uh so everyone knows I will not be advisor mayor Shirley will be chairman um so Randy on Just for example take 2.2 thank you so they started with my city processes and I'm I'm sort of familiar with the channels and wheels and all that kind of stuff so why underneath that 2.2.1 it says the Sydney will coordinate with which they could have taken the opportunity to say but we didn't see some inconsistencies there what do you think is the best adverb or the best bird there is it shown is it will a little similar I I think that they that the will languages it's more optimal for what the community is trying to do you're making a you're making a commitment to try right versus you shall you shall have this result I don't know that there's a lot to be gained from editing the document to make every shallow will or will a shout I think the net effect is likely fairly similar you see it looks like the way this is drafted if you look at it throughout the objectives typically carry the shallows and the policies that Implement them carry the wills and so it's it's more of a as a policy we're gonna this is what we're going to do this is what we're trying what we're planning to do it's not by way of mandate it's a direction we intend to move okay that makes sense and these whales we do this anymore it's already done then specifically it's been a bad decision because good morning I guess we can get some data so there's this project I know it's the stormwater we've upgrade to we're looking forward and I guess I just wanted to show that that's right so um this is something I brought up in the planning zoning board meeting um you can see the right where we get crossed out and it was a yeah so is everything over a hundred thousand dollars on I updated it based on what has occurred this year on this reflects also drafted the budget so um I can I can get with Linda sure about adding some some detail um I think this is just kind of like the layout that's required for this plan and we just moved into numbers based on what's Happening well and I'm not so concerned about necessarily adding detail I just want to know what um like in other words if you say you know tell us that this is what that three million dollars is for in 2023 is you know two million north of white or whatever okay we're approving right um correct me if I'm wrong but this isn't the resolutions and decisions that were approved during our Council meetings are recovering decisions right this is just reflecting it's our current state of affairs yeah it's a reporting element of it it's not um supplement to your company it's not a policy it's not an objective you're not bound to it that same way it's reflecting presently at time of adoption this is where those are those communities I just wanted I want to know the backing I was just answering his questions in the background yeah previously the con plan included uh storms or storm water plan that that required to be spent 500 000 or something ridiculous when in fact our number was 5 million so there was a big discrepancy and as an outsider if you look at the comp plan it's like oh they're not doing anything about it you know which is well not from this area you might review this and that's what I kind of want these numbers to be somewhat accurate of what we have and that's actually one of the one of the reasons that schedule was removed in whole in its previous iteration and was this is that's one thing even between our last um LPA meeting about two and a half weeks ago and today Kyle was working to get that aligned more currently with where uh fiscal figures are at present so that work is being done has been done I I believe um and that's but I I hear you're wanting to see sort of the back and forth that's something we can do you know offline and otherwise but that that effort has been made to make sure it aligns with realities any of this document this is uh ten thousand yeah I don't necessarily go into a lot of page I understand where you're coming from uh probably not a bad idea just to show us the man I came up with this and which I don't know it's all out there probably there's probably a simplified version facility any other questions or comments nope all right let's go in once one all right we are on to item number two the 2019 strategic plan a place okay I've placed this agenda item based on the last [Music] in some time and I look back through our records and found that the last meeting that was really discussing the Strategic plan was on July 12th and I wasn't vice mayor a gun at the time um did a presentation I actually reached out to the vice minor Gunner previous got his last presentation his materials from where we left off at so I wanted to include that um in the packet so you only could see them what his thoughts for the Strategic plan um and if you go through the last presentation it kind of this has been covered as since the uh the origin of the Strategic plan but it talks about um assumptions made in the city it talks about the slot analysis the streets strains this is opportunities and threats that relate to Ballard Beach and then it goes and at the time of this 2018 the council kind of set aside five specific polls for the city that will help the city reach its Mission and overall vision those goals are public safety and health tax dollar value communication and Community Aesthetics and Beach and water it doesn't have page numbers but about halfway through this page is the last layout of the existing goals with the objectives that were assigned to them and it says the v22 I went through that and took that document and kind of cleared off some of the goals that we've we've tackled this year it kind of opened up to new objectives where we need some new objectives to get us to these goals [Applause] and the the main stress uh stressed idea when when vice mayor Gunn gave this presentation was that it needed to be thought about and included in the budget process so with that being said um I just want to say some of the just the little ones that I checked off the list that we had the well the emerging emergency generated funding we decided to postpone that or um not not pursued at this moment we had the city manager selection that's been done the AV remote audio visual remote access that has been done and upgraded the playground decision playground has been installed locking easement we surveyed the residents on that got the feedback and the buoying decision rapid ordinance and created the new bathing area so that leaves us with the address of mitigate Street flooding issues which I believe that were still underway um revisit economic impacts of CRP and Reserve funds we did a lot of that when we talked about the bond issue but I think that's an ongoing process uh this one I wasn't aware but the gulp of our traffic monitoring on the crosswalk I mean 12th Street is it's ironic because we we're discussing the intersection specifically was talking about that crosswalk which I know um some of the ideas surrounding that crosswalk and what the county is doing in the study could come up with redesign if we decide to do anything um beautification that's the underground project and then after we underground power The Next Step I believe would be a street fighting situation and then beatry nourishment we know that's a major issue [Applause] of the document um and then what we do need to do is establish a new records Council I do have a question um once the undergrounding construction begins let's say for example there was a street that connects to say 20th Street of 9th Street and if we wanted uh in our student agreed to do undergrounding would there be any Financial benefit of attending to coordinate that with the work that'll be done on the boulevard as opposed to doing at a different date I would say no I believe we're so far ahead of that kind of coordination or planning the current plan now goes down below Boulevard and it comes one pole in the street but to at this point um have that design and whatever equipment it it weighs out engineering lives to plan plus when you're dealing with in between those houses in those easements you have a lot of vegetation issues that right here so it does actually come one whole it comes one totally and then what has been done I mean the reason that Golf Boulevard is being underground is because there is any infrastructure money driving to that the Bellevue Estates Island project was it was a assessment that all those residents to move forward and fund the project I think the history is at one time the whole city was looked at for underground and it was sort of the feedback that not the whole city wanted to do it and that's where they decided to do that separate assessment for the island okay and then it was look good afterwards University at Harrison Avenue look at it because we didn't have twice what they paid um and so obviously getting into the streets to buy in would make sense but get the underground Boulevard that first because that brings like on harrisonment it brings the power all the way back to Bell Auto talk about High business so I so it really eliminates a lot of expense okay yeah Harrison also has the under water yeah so this lack drives the price quite a bit too so um so there's just some some ways of finding any more students to buy in you know of course the aisles are the underground hibiscus on board taking that down and I know I'm good so you know if you get a couple of the streets um but you know it was like for 20 years such a small Short Street by the time they bring it back to the first house or the first poll which is probably two miles today or something yeah that's the expense I saw a presentation from Duke Energy concerning underground and uh there there's no incentive Underground but what they said they would do and right now they're doing it down south because they are improving the bandwidth with acquiring normal and we'll keep everything running in some communities they're available or they're building uh that's usually knock one of the little ones down here you've got the paper requires more power so what they've said to me whenever I asked about what what can we do how can we put our rates jobs though I said whenever we decide to upgrade your infrastructure you are more than welcome to use pores rather than doing it overhead do it underground and then you pay the extra so they would commit to the money they would be spending anyway okay and then your neighborhood in the kitchen that's one thing they can say okay but you're probably going to be waiting because there's not a lot of action going on about our age as far as building it's a little one here a little in there and eventually they'll hit that saturation foreign [Music] the future says with the lab in 2024. but we keep pushing electric electric electric heat electric cars not only putting all these cars on the screen hanging wire up top you can increase that as much as you want you can only use I think we're at the Max Capacity now if you're hitting the physical constraint all right but I mean you're at the max I don't know if it's double zero y or not that you're using for underground but what I'm saying you can't go anymore where if they had a string more wire up top you could always hang it yeah the solution and that's maybe I just can't see put 300 million cars on the grid in the United States was out of power so for into your neighborhoods pay attention I had them come out and do work on our poles and replace poles and we had we had no power we had no power losses I called them and said yeah [Music] the engineer and it worked important when you've not had a lot of power outages we just had one a week ago but it was a wire somebody contract but um when we were when it commented here we were out five days in the South End and if you talk to Duke they're contractors 90 of it was because of what you just said vegetation that the home didn't take care of it well it's hard to it's hard to claim to work whenever it's directly behind the tables yeah who actually owns the property line no one does rarely ever again yeah but when you see it start climbing up she said you need to address it and get somebody out there and Duke will cut it unless it's wrapped up after the transport and then they say oh but I like what you said regarding um I wonder if at that time he said well our estimates gonna need five dollars so that this would be a time if you're interested in doing [Music] but they're gonna have to come out here soon press that because it looks really in the background so they're going to explain me the release their amount of money because Transformers and wires and holes is assist with that home I don't want to get too far away and whenever we fix this to get started with the entire State I mean it started with a few eye on the stage but whenever we said that you know I really like to do it for the whole city there were so many people that didn't want to pay that extra money not a nice year was in their backyard and so you embarrassed to teach you about where you want to be it it's a lot of money all right what's next so you're asking for us to to discuss this now I know that several several meetings to get this dialed in to where where it is now and and I do see there's a lot of a lot of items here that will resolved yeah I will say that this Council and the heart as well done and the council before that also the city's been going in the right direction and vice mayor Dunham because he did he did a great job of kind of dialing the city in and getting his photos so um my recommendation would be start with this list that we've got in our goals here and the tile is already going forward maybe we spent about completely 30 minutes on this okay everybody feel all right with that all right so Kyle would be looking at page 10. where we start going through the list one of the things that I saw Public Safety one of the things that I did not see and I don't think that we ever actually came to a complete agreement on it we were discussing ditching the generator then we store and kind of went back and we were rematching that trying to make them killed it yeah you don't remember that I remember saying it was suicide after the last meeting it was killed off him I just wanted to make sure yeah you never need it right yeah that was on the list and uh um working with uh Public Safety and Health had somebody called in about uh looking at the waterways out here where we're getting people that are zipping by the the jet skis Etc we don't have any set zones for Speed um a warning and I noticed that in the Pinellas workup they said that we should be at least looking at safety of boating we will monitor the speeds vessels but you know perhaps in this area that we put the the safety buoys out I don't know if they're uh speed buoys or uh I I mean I don't vote authors does anybody see the boats um signs on them and then some some police um okay but that's relatively close to the short not in the big area in the center because it's Heat the skiers out there quite very long okay is there any problem with out in that area I know they're relatively close to shore they tend to watch that I mean but we do have them though yeah any collisions between boats and amenities like I said in those areas where there's no limits we've had them right we've had them hit right off of uh sixth 12th Street with the jet skis in fact I got two citizens that said I didn't see it but they said there was they were doing some filming right off between sixth and seventh yesterday flying in and I said you sure they want residents at Bel Air Shores yeah I said no because then they took off and tried to hit the sea dunks up by 8th Street you know straightened here and gets hit by a boat but speak out a lot of jet ski rentals I mean other things I want to talk to the jet ski rental place saying you know we don't allow mine that's the golden skiers you see out there minimum wage kids running in the Jeffersons yeah yeah they drive it up here you know pretty powerful like those bicycles where those little Parts they rent they come through our neighborhoods all the time so there's nothing out here people we've all seen craziness that happens I would like to well we're talking about waterways and Public Safety I think that we still need to focus on the boat memories that are being created out here and they many of them are just vegan maybe we can people live on them I don't know and they're not pumping out they're just dumping overboard there there are some regulations but if it's not enforced and I don't know how we I know we are supposed to be monitoring and managing off of our property you know off of Bellaire Beach this side of the intercoastal I believe is what when this came up before we talked about and I know we don't have a boat to monitor that but you know can we Engage The Sheriff to do a little more monitoring to ask for proof of registration ask for proof of pumping out of those vessels um you know it's a it's a hazard dude I thought Lynn because we brought this up when Lynn was still here yeah we had one Toad and yeah and he cleaned up a lot of remember some of them yeah there's a couple of them and from what I'm seeing it words or I guess our jurisdiction really because it looks like they pushed them just right to the that jurisdiction a lot that's what I'm saying I think it's from what Lynn told me is this side of the intercoastal along Ballard Beach and that's where I've seen that alive or more or are you seeing them well you know what if you're around the doctors out here so that I don't know if that's us or is that ours it looks like it when you look at the maps from their Pinellas thing they have the big black line yeah that thing is um but as far as just anchoring and not everyone on them I mean I got a whole presentation about like how they're making every effort they can but there's not much they can do even though we have um submerged lands out here that doesn't apply they're on top of the water so we don't own the waters um and my understanding is it doesn't make a difference how far out they are they could be right up on us but we still can enforce registration and you haven't pumped out weekly then you need to move on you know we can you can be ticketed or fine I mean there are some requirements to having a vessel those requirements exist out you could yeah increase it until you get an enforcement capability it's worthless you can write all the laws in the book but unless you got a boat to enforce it um control in the streets we'd like to have someone on the Waterway you know we'd like to see a schedule where the waterways looks like what is the Deputy on our water levels gas is expensive yeah so we would say they they tagged one and they they have the people removed and they find them and the votes left there well where are they going to take what do they do and at a reason why they did this one sweet was because they had funds I believe that's the way they look they had so much funds and rank these things and I already saw the ones with a big orange mark on them those were tomorrow is okay he wants to get rid of those points yeah and then they get funding to throw them away and Destroy them you know the professor that only comes not a whole lot of money well if you remember two three years ago there was just a pile of them going into Dunedin yeah toward the road and they finally cleaned them off now they migrate yeah well we can certainly add this to the list and keep it on our radar there's always going to be a nuisance but it should always be something that we're paying attention to because New Opportunities may may arise where we could actually make a difference for the decision okay and it's not I mean I think the fitness issues when they start pouring behind someone's house they're really bad issues which happened again the 22nd right there was about out there but it was tied off right foreign I would say go for vibrant well-planned well-maintained appearance because you put that right there I got this thing behind me you know the black pearls or behind my house everyone has to agree with that yep me over contract or permitting I like that I want to one of those is that even though we look at plants and they run through their own standard process we don't have a tool in place to actually find out if this plans are actors basically going through the property and taking a look at it and take the design ated value make a decision on a business that is that's correct um the Pinellas County Building Services is our building department through the agreement so when they expect they're supposed to verify the work that's being done if any extra work has happened so um I've had different cases where I had suspicions that there could possibly be more and I I've kind of mentioned something but that really is what they do but right I do understand I'm in a large County handling it in our jurisdiction it's definitely more economical but I can see how you know they're could it could get lost on some of the details um that's why I try to if I do see anything that um stands out as possibly extra work or something different being done Maybe maybe our code is more enough to check uh gearing Construction there should be some way that we can at least raise a red flag if we suspected that there was an issue or not in the way that they I think Steve wsd5 it does you know monitor what is occurring and it does check in with our office on what permits are actually being held um and then really what what's being done inside the house that's all on the county because what we can't see we don't know anybody certified to really do it nobody's trained Architects engineer they one of our drive-by guys cannot assess that legally I mean you can't say oh your load bearing walls here no so the city's mainly looking at the um the zoning and the the flood plain code I think a lot of my attention gets directed to make sure people are following the remodeling rules [Music] so the only issue would be the website wherever they are definitely come into play would be or somebody deny he doesn't move once there is a permit I've had two days over yeah I'm sure I'm good share a story about someone that I know that has talked with them and plan good support accounting for Doc company but what they didn't do was they didn't take the pie shame angle created the guy's property as a straight square piece of land so you know if he was going to have this nice dog and going to find out after the doctors Bill he was only going to have a foot between his lip and his speaker his favorite property so he had to pay 50 bills but because they completely got it wrong and actually like with the road that shown on the original yes it was I think that just somehow or another it there's a there's something missing in our way that that we're issuing permits and it was approval and it's way more than you should have that's really weird because the tax partially individual aspects today I mean the engineers should pick that up that wasn't saying like that this isn't a rectangle or square property it is if you're a good engineering automated assigning whatever make sure to say yeah good and bad okay right so are you saying that the where the property lines are injected correctly in the department application um and they built it wrong I I think the way that they drew the plan of it looked like the cropping line between 90 degrees out from the land three beers if it was like this and so he would run right into it if you didn't get the bills called the projects and I'm not going to even change anything because I'm engaged within the 12 minutes but I didn't want and so it'd be a good day in there it would have been put it away from is that this board guy he was doing everything right call it a practical company training through those plans he went through the entire system and whatever the time you installed the metal structure you couldn't do it because he realized this is going to be way too close so that's kind of I think I guess yeah the engineering aspect of it like what I've seen um this past year is a lot of Architects and Engineers submitting drawings that are well done and then trying to have the city engineer work through the the errors and the drawings which really isn't with their purpose so yeah I think and that's what I was going to say is I know that we're having trouble with nothing setbacks things like that you know some basic errors were on there so now we have an engineer reviewing the site plan for before they go to the county I mean that's helped eliminate a lot of the problems is he looking at the doc plans too probably not right maybe we should get our no we're looking at the value we're looking at the projections of the property lines yeah but you're only as good as their drawings yeah yeah but it's this drawings drawing was completely wrong so that kind of fault that falls back um [Music] and what they say um then it just becomes a violation of our code so I mean I'm dealing with some an hour you know like a either with the impervious ratio sometimes they give you one plan but they come in the morning or or the elevations on what they say or whatever and I think the the challenge you're facing too is you're looking to create policy around anecdotal instances which are which are difficult to regulate towards that those events certainly happen um are not necessarily indicative of a systemic issue and you guys are looking at strategic plans and systemic visioning and policy making which I think is a little harder to say Nitty Gritty we're going to change everything because this one thing happened where which could have just been an anomaly in the process stretching their purpose if we're not the ones inspecting it and it goes to the county and they approve it is it on the county or approving it or is it back on us or not well it's on us for reviewing what they submit I'm not that it's changed then I'd say that account influence inspecting it at that point the side issue when I was being very brief because I know this has been talking about coaches shouldn't be discussing right now but but that's I think I've always said we need to be inspecting these site these sites as they're being built even though we're not given them the official construction inspection but because of just that you get a loose landscape plan and before we know that the entire yard is paid is concrete or something which was not what they submitted but they pushed the limits in you know shared with a couple of my neighbors they've they've gone in and put concrete down both sides their entire back there was concrete and you know that's not allowable and in the case of a new construction um so I'm measuring setback measuring the previous service I try to pay attention little services that they're getting more um but if what they do married from the plan but I think it's important everyone because I don't think we were doing that at one time so if it's improving as we go to California there's the changing some things that is happening and we're constantly watching the Landscaping because there's been no permitage required for landscaping so we do have a lot of code that covers where things can and can be all right Baseline gazebo and see it's it's all this list and I know this is your flag we have any plans that's one thing I saw on there and then it never kind of made it over to the objectives list I never heard uh 100 yes 100 no so it's kind of still on the table of my mind it's nothing about it we've not really discussed it um it would fall under the Bayside Park we do have money anyone else like to make comments goal number one it's still on the list as you go um I wonder if we've ever asked uh you're talking right out here right is have we ever asked the parties that do use this place would you like to see a gazebo or would you have used a gazebo if offered that we have some actual data to work off of if they're coming back no no no then okay scratch it but if they're coming back yeah I would have paid X right yeah [Music] yeah let them versus the um the renters because most of our renters are actually no but the parks will do that yeah and they'll probably ask you do we have data and they can add that into their recommendations and maybe it's not bad but it's something similar too only uh 12th Street crosswalk Franklin Iowa situation we've kind of beat this one there anything to Monitor and we consider dropping angles so you're keeping it and then we finally decided yes we have to have it till belong on this list I I don't know if you in my mind we've reached that point because the last I recalls that we're having the county kind of restarting the whole situation yeah it's still open yeah anything else you'd like to add to goal number one so the expedite walking trail okay yeah that was killed um it's always going to be there and that's one of the things that regular maintenance Eternal vigilance right you know the I'm sorry I've got any kind of a varied response to Citizens I talked to I thought everybody would be in favor of more and better lighting I know them and uh that's not what I've seen I've seen maybe 50 of the people saying yeah [Music] saying I don't want anyone else there's a winner for my house I don't want it yeah a difficult situation um a lot of negotiating with neighbors and trying to find safe spots but I think for the most part once it's finished everyone just said well I've got one now or I don't and they were but that really is light fixtures at about yeah eight foot high so nobody gets them and they just go down on the ground you can't do that let me have more directions [Music] okay cool well that also addresses the modernized lighting back there on page 14 as well yeah all right deliver the best value for the taxpayer dollars just curious emphasis not on ours I would check that pixel sustainable budget process Capital planning contracts City Investments I think we're doing all of that already I continue to invest in our human resources on City staff well we did that with Kyle then you also did the uh the reviews of the just job descriptions I know yours was done but anybody else be our last job description review was 2019. we just did the Personnel policies an employee handbook and that's uh being reviewed right now the way uh annually reviewed compensation development going on pretty well with the human resources and security staff but I'd love to give the city managers I believe we're doing we're doing well and like I said we just we're all seeing our personal policies um I had some proposal in the budget on how to best use staff and um a later meeting but dealing with the administrative assistant we've kind of we felt it temporarily for about three weeks a little bit more hours in the front office of the clerical stuff so that was for a hard time decision that was a part of our GPS and I believe when we talked about last month it's like when we agreed to lower the hours of Code Enforcement I think that's worked out as well but we're still looking for some code effectively um and that is the price it's a high price tag the Sheriff's Office do it so that's something to kind of weigh out I think my staff as well not saying get rid of one or the other at this point Merry Christmas [Music] um no I'm just talking about the contractual hours with the Pinellas County Sheriff to do code enforcement versus um more hours and how we can letting our staff accomplish what we need to do are we getting the training and development for the staff as needed I mean do you see opportunity um I think we're doing fairly well I mean we just started airing Community Services he'll be doing uh you know the public works developing and things like that um there's a there's well they do classes like they're like confidence boxes um formalized you can train them but there's probably some opportunities yeah sure currently I think that is pretty low caught up in her position um safety program we're doing our training in-house with our Public Works staff and then as far as code enforcement I think you know if there is training for that certification is just to better understand the process depending how we move on that if we're still doing good code enforcement on the weekends we are Steve Berry's schedule this Saturday or Sunday and then you might have a weekend he tries to uh you know mix it up then of course okay within house real doing it weekend treatments right I'm not doing anything in-house on the weekends that could be a ranch so it looks like we've got that area covered pretty well great job training and opportunities to learn a couple good questions was a full-time position is that a position that you could keep busy it was full-time because apparently I'm hearing it's difficult to find somebody a part-time with yes it was a full-time person working then into your position I know you guys were a lot of different hats would you be able to keep that in person doing things at the cities and what I would do is get them more involved with the code enforcement and a lot of a lot of the things that are done in the office as well with the community code enforcement because the sheriff's deputy does the field of work but they're still along that work nurses and the hearing aids and the coordination finds so there's a lot of work inside that gets done with code enforcement what would we have to do we have the money and the budget to go ahead and advertise for an old-time admin as opposed to a part-time University as of now at this day we could we could advertise and be able to we have enough money in the budget for compensate someone to respond here okay because we haven't at that position filled it's all just under a month but would that impinge upon other requirements like you know storm all the needed to work um I don't think John I think that being such a small City and we're all kind of like hybrid staff where we do a lot of different things because I'm looking at also you got to double load it I mean you got the salary everybody thinks celery but that's full time now health benefits welfare our vision everything so that's kind of what it is sort of a big big Chomp there I mean we could put it in the budget to look at it and that's that's all it's a consideration um you know moving like I said like the contractual employees with the with the sheriff for those hours are very expensive um but yeah when you have full time you have the benefits that are included but um part of the problem with being able to fill that position I think is if you offered that full-time wait a little it's more incentive another thing I'm thinking about is um I can't say exactly when but we do have experience going to be staffed turnover on due to retirements in the future and I think it's important to try to get somebody in the office maybe that's going to work a lot a little ways into the future I was younger to kind of start learning the ropes to make a transition um certainly would it be possible I mean you're looking at you know Dave okay fine let's put this forward as a budget proposal but along with the time phase I mean your best shot at okay here's my employers here's their really their range of you know Sundown so I kind of know how I'm facing these employees out how I'm phases these employees in that might help us to get a better handle to go okay our needs will be met for a longer period of time with a more Optimum selection of resource meaning you have a full-time person but you're balancing it perhaps with less hours on a contract basis with you know the person going out to review code because you sell a lot of it's the back-end paperwork so we can you know move some resources around but we need to see the resource loading right and then again with the staff turnover planning and you know it's just I have a feel for it it's a guess it's not an exact thing because you know life changes yeah it's a broad just an idea it sounds like you answer your mind which was if we had a full-time person in there [Music] and a lot of good reasons foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] although when I delete a message because it's time for me before you guys always get back I'm shooting me back quicker than me than most because I'm recording yeah I just think if that person was full-time and that person would also being taken on more responsibility of addressing citizens coming to the front as well as answer the phone I think that's huge okay so uh Human Resources aspect covered and it's something that will continue to be one of our adults and focus on uh you have a big job descriptions evaluations training and development [Music] s continue to optimize CIP okay find creative ways to fund our projects and get things done and go into business so that one definitely needs to stay on engagement advisory committee we do that every opportunity we can speak yes it's an advisory and he does on top of our regular demonstrating maximize return on investment City Hall Marina and Marina parking lot I think over the years recent years we've really there's a lot of rentals between weddings and events at this so they're definitely maximizing the space appearance and obviously we're discussing the marina tonight always focused on leverage grants special assessments it's nice to get grants definitely taking advantage of the special assessments something they should just always be on the radar develop a grant policy best practice that's ongoing also integrate with all capital project and budget processes yes any opportunity we get through here at these people projects grants special assessments [Music] the whole goal number two is pretty much yeah you better be doing this yeah right yeah whoever is technology especially in Communications did it upstairs everybody I had someone say in the residents would not direct this facility for their wedding because there's and that and there's nothing you can do about making them go away when you're trying to make this a nice event home you have to put a cover on them so we might at some point look at doing something like that but just because it came to my mind um I don't know what type of wrap they may fold up yeah I'd probably just load a visual on it you know like a you know happy wedding yeah put the bride in the group that's right videos of your from your dad that's a good idea final item on this is uh that's something that we'll be doing this time and we'll do this every year and it is 7 30. up at 7 36 okay with the city manager a second there is all right now we're back from our break you know moving on to Gold number two page two integrate rescue funds into your budget a green allocate School modifying for gold Boulevard Underground so we um still that's in progress right now so it's still on our our goal list they gave emergency generator acquisition for the FEMA Grant that didn't happen per month that's interesting that it's on goal one angle to because I think we had FEMA Grant on the goal too with the tax dollar value instead of self-funding it's a guess to develop a local intern program with local schools website admin Financial Services I don't think we're doing anything for that is this something that's should be one of our goals or is this is this something uh same like I think it's like an idea someone helping with David administration of Zoom I mean it's always something you could pursue I don't know where to find it I can't say that I have an intern right now the intern is doing is a highly specialized American Steel and also I just uh I don't think a reason because frankly that's a city manager you know when you need Manpower you direct if how when I think the only question would be is are there any schools that have well I mean community colleges whatever they have a city government type program that we can actually helping Center where it's not self-serving right we're pumping build or as you say that you may have retiring if you're a technical bringing interns through a program that could help our city and you could eventually bring on employees or have that full of people available but I don't know if there's you know we're not we're not near Tallahassee no there's like no SPC has a public policy and they do that that's their last their Keystone project is all working with the city government in a specific project they they pitch it they move it they run it our staff doesn't have time to join it at the same time do anyone other questions the answer is this types of resources I'm all for eign or something like that but you have to have some have someone manage your own okay and I still think here that I mean not a lot of benefit showing someone how to run a zoom meeting but I bet that there's Volunteers in this community in this step right up and help us out and that nominal training you're not having to get out of your seat volunteering position so instead of that they would just maybe have a goal of time volunteers yeah see community volunteers yeah anything else this old number two all right um the grant program leverage grants special assessments development Grant programs all right now we're on the goal number three um and I think after we ran up goal number three let's pause this one and because we've got quite a few pages and then they will move on to the next discussion in fact because there's several pages to go number three maybe we can probably stop now at least cover the first first page and then we'll take a pause and Community go through incredible timely and transparent information and feedback between the city and residence engender or cry of ownership so uh the first the first item in that goal is Foster Code Compliance versus enforcement educate and Communications so I think that that's going on right now the safety plan because a good job of trying to educate and not just relaxing uh how do you um that's a ongoing battle with having a a uniformed officer I think it can kind of come across threatening but I've been working in a lot of different scenarios where um just trying to have an approach of not too harsh of enforcement unless necessary initial communication friendly and but the goal to achieve compliance of where it needs to be and not come across to uh to uh aggressive I guess I would say so um yeah that's ongoing um but I think it's coming from inside the city and our approach on code enforcement has always the goal is to get the problem solved and you know you know different situations called for different understanding and working on president but um yeah I think we're doing a pretty good job would you say that uh has improved in the way that he handles these situations yes I think we've um sort of tailored um what how he approaches each situation based on what what Bellar Beach is uh focused on what's important um because we all know there's like there's different laws and codes that you can always you could enforce in every situation or um there could be you know identifying one thing that's very important in other Beach like the fact that you need a permit to do the same work as opposed to you also notice that there's nothing appropriate signage on the vehicle says that you could um I've been trying to direct them more into what was important for our community versus you know enforcing every all right of course and there's certainly a different attitude and goes along with let's say erect in the Second Story without a permanent versus your agents being too high yeah so there's certain times where I appreciate this firmness especially with the contractors and uh illegal you know any type of construction or BMW for sure that's very important okay okay that one should always be back to that attitude I like to provide in there thinking of our community not only only safety and enforcement or something you understand how to do it right modernized lighting story this Justice and but this is something we're not really doing much would have had this related I continue to work through options with Duke Energy um so I do have some information once we get feel like we get to that point we want to start considering what our options are but I have been in communication with you and the solar lighting companies to just understandable you can do you know kind of what what the minimum we can do and then what might be like our Dream idea of what we 've done now for the areas where there's poor lighting but the electricity speed runs behind the between the fastest human homes or we can start automatically looking at solar or are we are awake whatever you're taking you're you're evaluating our options considering undergrounding to where the polls that is being considered too it's pros and cons in different things it just depends on the street um there's some areas where um if you're a place to pull you're probably going to put in a different location there's there's areas where when you're talking about underground and that does involve getting easements so it's a little extra leg work if you're going to go that route solar energy is pretty much um there's another thing that came up with the lighting arms of Duke Energy provides that have a little bit more breach to them so that's beneficial on the county maintained road called Boulevard where that's not a important when you're in the neighborhoods um so yeah it's kind of something um depending on where we're trying to upgrade where it just kind of needs to consider the pros and cons of what is available on there another thing that came up on Gulf Boulevard is the uh the acceleration for Turtles Duke Energy is now doing Amber lighting which is um certified by that yeah um and and you know took people in the community that's a concerned figuring out there your lighting they won't you've already environmental friendly okay all right as long as we I think I believe Council would agree with me that as long as we have uh maybe a game plan what what I'd like to see is I'd like to see where the darkest areas in Bella Beach where do we need it most and and some sort of a schedule eventually through there okay we're we're budgeting X number of dollars per year for Street lighting and near State water if we're getting because there are some streets out there scream always from time it's three legs the worst and I hope that that's uh when you ask for the lighting studies I tend to find that they give you the layout of what optimal lighting is I might be able to work with the Duke Engineers to find out the dark spots or to focus on that because usually the end okay this is what you need or what you should have um but it doesn't really it showed that all the initial lights and I guess you could do it in reverse of counting where more lights are very installed obviously this is a later conversation but I just wanted to make sure that we we're going to keep this in our in our strategic plan uh funding and I'd want to kind of come up with some ideas of where what direction we're going to have been that leads me yes it wouldn't do does that is that a cost name that they charges are that good yeah so they can actually do I agree with the mayor that we actually have a city-wide plan that dude could do for us and be good and then maybe it's just like was brought up earlier one stream said we'd like to have lights like they have a service degree but it may not be possible because of the power of and understand what the what the plan is for the street lights or maybe they don't have safety is what goes in aggressive writing to where they I think even City staff could analyze what our current placement of lights are throughout the city and we could we could almost establish where the best of it foods are but you know light for so many feet and then we're the worst place and then if we could establish a standard we're trying to beat someone we're at and then work towards it all right and uh thoroughly evaluate solar options and grants for the various options and whenever you look at these solar lighting are you States for case study or any ideas as far as the maintenance sensor to install them definitely is a case study and recently I now that we've kind of worked out at the Kinks because we did have some battery Replacements we had to do um there was some programming issues it's been a good run I've seen in almost the last year straight um because we had a lot of issues on Olivia and that was mainly because the settings were off so they they completed the batteries causing us that would be replaced which they're good with sending us new ones if you need to replace but I think our staff has gotten very good at maintaining those and what we do is we try to work them in the maintenance as we have the list throughout the purposes and improves you know we're still I'm currently um working on trying to get something for the uh Underground project I I passed it through the County's LMS working group and we were ranked three on the list so if we can qualify for fun age it's there we're right you know see all of us determines what the order of the project so we got really tied along with the county um the problem is that better for the cost ratio was meeting that standard and the uh the gray it's a hazard mitigation grant for a hurricane um yeah so the money's there right now um I've scheduled a new consultation to the assistance with working through this cost ratio I've been bouncing around a lot of different ideas of how to show the cost savings for the price of the project and that's that's our greatest battle that we face in Middle Outreach um it's kind of meeting up with a below residence and the cost of some of the projects and there's some other issues when it comes to Grants the when it comes to storm Waters the whole tide indoor Regional system um and then there's obviously a social economic Factory where you can have lower requirements based on basically improvements Coral Belair Beach we'll keep them on the uh we'll keep them on our goals a list until they're done once we get past all of the stormwater projects I don't want to take photos all right expand Marina parking lot you immunizations you don't like here's an idea and I was thinking about this maybe later but looking at the sand stations here wherever we had a hurricane we have a situation where we one clog up the street with traffic and if there's any rain that tends to clog up the drainage here but it's an industrial type activity loading sandbags where we could just move those over to the parking in the marina Park he put those off to the side like we store items for underground what are you talking about well this has actually expand the marina parking lot utilization you know I'm talking years and talk about moving stuff sorry moving the sandbag stations should have prefaced that yeah moving the sandbag stations to the marina parking lot because we have more room for traffic they can come in one side go out the other and it's an industrial type area for an industrial type use if we move those uh bins from here then it goes back to being a park with additional parking and it eliminates that that traffic tie up for the residents of the street well putting the sandbag down in the morning that's an evacuation plus there's an island right there you really want to clog up an artery for evacuation or sandbagging because people trying to get in and coming out we're closing it up here it's nicely it's one little stream of claw and and you know I've been here nine years and I worked at sandbag place for nine years I've only ever seen it clogged up once and that was this has to be in store that everybody thought thank you Lord for not hitting us um why don't we do this I think that something you'd like us to seriously yes [Music] all right so there was an engine inflection station I think I put that in as I agree you can remove it I put that in looking at you know almost turning that into a full Marina but I I didn't know there was really not a use for it we all actually going to be plenty of use for it but do we want to maintain it and do we want to have it monitored and all that especially whenever the city of Clearwater is a great supervised two of them across the intercoastal and one maybe one of them also at the gas station so yeah I would like that everyone else agree yes yeah yes they had two nice ones down there with them you guys can't have nice things anymore yes it's a shame uh minimize above ground utilities quite a bit tonight we know that we had our way we probably do it everywhere but we also know that it's something that requires a lot of effort for Birds but it's something we'll always talk about consider do we want to leave it on here okay yeah all right but your manicure knowledge and vegetation uh develop the city-wide maintenance program we did that in a year one of the plan of those strategic plan so it should change it from develop to maintain complete a city asset inventory to include City staff we have an asset inventory but so they want to I'm not sure where this is going they want to have staff include in some way I don't I don't know if I suppose I can remove it do include City staff thank you and I mean it's complete now do we need to do this on here no no what does this last one really mean I don't understand it about breaking out of walking easement it was along the lines of when we were doing the street repeating that we would do the sections of all I can use that yeah which remain in their maintaining which that could be brought up into your maintenance program but make sure that Washington could you repeat that question yeah I said um the uh walking easy should be part of the maintenance program to make sure it can go away right yeah I would agree with that and a lot of the maintenance with The Walking these men um yes so we're stopping at page 15 as well all right let's move on to item number three Arena this is something that I actually work on with city manager but but so we went over the existing slips that we have available for rent they're numbered one through 19 but it really slip one is unusable it hasn't been used in a while so part of this uh first page here is a renumbering and redesigning of the slips and then based on the sizes of the steps we do some comparisons of how they how they group together and the idea is to classify different size slips a b and c and you can see that um Class A would be the largest slips and those are the range I don't have the exact either based on the with being with the slip but the idea is that those larger slips that could accommodate longer boats wider boats that you designate those slips for boat lengths of 30 to 40 feet and then the next class down would be a Class B and that would be for both 24 to 34 feet and smallest slips would be a Class C and they would be for boats 20 to 28 feet and the purpose of this is to maximize the available space in the marina to try to again provide it for residents but to get to make sure we're not sticking a 20-foot boat in the biggest slip that we have but I thought the uh we were looking at this and the residents should have that ability to make the decision if they're willing to pay that amount they don't have to have the vote that matches at they can stick their kayak in there if they are on the list and they're willing to pay it put them in there I don't want to force the resident to buy a two million dollar boat just to have the ability to put it in the marina and I think that's what we're trying to head for that's why I was kind of shocked I saw the numbers but I don't see a plan and that's what we're going to look at the how you rank people perhaps re-ranking what we already have out there and providing The Residency ability to purchase a slip regardless of their boat [Music] so so what we did was we came up with an abnc paperwork okay and that's where you get in line [Music] so now if any one of these and let's just say you pick a and any one of those slips comes available and you're the next person in line whether you have a boat or not then you you can get that Swift however by you selecting a then you are committing that you are going to have no more or no less than I'm sorry no less than 30 feet no more than 40 feet we also provide you with the option to go shopping you can find a boat but during the six months that you're looking for a boat and you don't until you have a vote we even work with you to where you can you'll get a 36 foot ring so if you're in the middle of the road right I absolutely disagree with allowance of like high end in a 17 foot watch yeah if they're paying the rent yeah I'm agree with him if you're paying them it's yours yeah your call because I may not be able to afford it lost in the stock market this whole thing came up because the resident got over it exactly and um yeah there are slips that are very narrative and there are slips that are very wide well it makes no sense at all to rent a a small I'm sorry a large very wide slip to somebody with a very narrow boat now if they were to do that what would you do if you'd say okay well you're charged the 30 feet and you're also percent preventing someone else we might want a bigger boat from getting in there I think it's perfectly fair if you look at the number of cities and the number of bees and the number of A's it's pretty well divided so you've got various various sizes of boats that we can accommodate see you'd only be locked in you have to call out I want slip a and there's a separate list for slippies separate list releases I don't agree either yeah are we going to tell people how many TVs they have to put in their house what you're proposing is exactly what happened call any Marina around here and say I want your biggest slip for my 18-foot book and they say your check good I think you're right I take that as a challenge I probably don't know I think if that slip is open and they're looking for money they'll take it yeah they're not I'm not saying we should reduce the price I mean do you kick that person out if they lose the boat if it's been surveyed well actually if they lost their vote they would have six months um going out maybe most universities available to you know because you have to explain what they're just slipped with a kayak yeah for six months and you're waiting to put your vote in you walk up and you don't really see a boat and that's what it does create the appearance that the city is not servicing in resonance saying that's what you did because you have six months to upgrade I can put that little five foot boat in there as long as within six months I buy the big monster so somebody's still going to come up to you and say well what's up well show them the receipt I mean we're gonna have some yeah there's gonna be some disagreement here obviously go look at so I misunderstood you were saying after the six months I'll have to meet the right as long as I can yeah I could park that five foot I could park that kayak in there because I got six months from that day I park it I'm paying the full rent to pull in that NASA boat now what happens if it's a construction delay that my brand new teak wood is not available so I still got another six months oh okay so yeah we're getting into the weeds Bud yeah that varies based upon with again with the slip so they're not all the same all right all right so um these are just the numbers I plugged in to get us roughly to the same slip Revenue okay you know just playing around with some numbers um but so I separated them out by the class class is the largest it's eleven dollars a foot for the resident um Class B is the medium ten dollars if that sees nine and then there's a non-resident fee um that again is just kind of a number that's could change but I just pick something so we can see how the numbers work I put it at the top where it says current Revenue that is with our 2023 um adjusted fees that is our curveball technically we just lost a boat on uh slip 16 which is it makes an available slip which is ironically the largest look we have so I think we need to make a careful decision on how we open the slip up but I plug the numbers in based on what we had previously leaving so 16. so um just to kind of show some things um the idea is if you don't have a low but you're holding a slip that's what that no vote number is I just wanted to show up the numbers would be if there were no boats at the rate but that would be um but I think the actual most important if you if we were to use this fee structure for what is in there right now we'd be making uh significantly more Revenue about ten thousand dollars here or more yearly but I think you need to take into account that the goal is but ultimately we we have all residents in those slips so at first we might have higher Revenue but over time we're going to see that Revenue go down because our goal is to have the marina completely but use my residence so then that last section there is the current boat lengths using this fee structure um and they're all residents so you do see that the revenue does go down because um you're not having any of those non-residents so it's kind of keeping it in the ballpark I thought um difference I thought that was close enough um playing with the numbers but that's just what I laid out so what are we doing about the initial problem what about that list and making it fair to all citizens so the careless it was that it was the largest slip I started at what our current policy was right we got down um and went down five weightless enrollees and um it ended up getting to the fifth person that was um down there for a 32 foot length boat but currently has a 28 foot length so I put it on hold based on the fact that they're willing to pay the um the 32 foot length fee for that slip right for six months but they only plan on putting a 28 foot boat in there so that kind of comes down to the decision of how we want to do this and being this our largest slip I just stopped right there because I thought once we got into the 28 you know 20 something Footers we're we're looking at giving our largest up to a smaller boat so I kind of wanted some direction on where we're going the difference it tells me it's like what did you tell the other four people that were in that list ahead of that they passed it up so they they were informed you had the ability you can do it okay so as long as they're totally informed of that yeah braids versus the current mix we only have one person paying nine dollars approach why wouldn't you drop the rates for everyone else foreign basically the minimum should be ten dollars yeah and then we're hung up on the lane but um it's really the beam that's the issue you could have a CV that's very narrow and long versus a it should be cubic foot or square foot well I'm just saying I mean it's more it's not as cut and dry of you know you've got a center console fishing boat there's your bite square footage but bump it out yeah but it but it's long the lake is there and I don't know if there's some tie to this mineral maximum length that you guys know what we were doing was making pretty much a generalization that uh the big long boat so we were trying to fill up as much as we try to make sure whatever both went in and whatever in the right direction of filling that yeah it's still just Advantage it's a it's a dock Master okay and that's where the problem s what I'm trying to do is take this decision away from people that are not professional doc Masters because without some kind of clear definition they can always be accused of playing favoritism that's right and so that's that's why we have some sort of a policy in place um philoski's here he always has something to say would you care to say anything about this time I didn't know what I mean what point point of order I think last means we don't allow a lot of uh input from the citizens during a working session as chair I can ask anybody anything and he's pretty objective well yeah we know I just check it that was my first look at that guys probably a little what what I wasn't expecting I think my goal as a resident today would be how do you simplify the city manager's job all satisfying the initial request while giving yourself a backup for you're going to find at times you've seen this once or twice in the last 25 years you're gonna need another list for outside of residents so I find it interesting I I don't know I'm not sure I'm comfortable with three lists but does that make your would that make your life smile and here's a thought before you answer that if you look at Dunedin for example they have things embedded in a lot of a lot ordinances around management of the marina one of them is tied to the list so if someone is in a slip they get priority to go to a bigger slip size if they want to get a bigger bowl if that helps you at all they actually took that into consideration that hey someone 10 years has a 28 footer wants to go into 37. they get to jump the list and not start over so this is why a lot of moving parts to this approach versus from linear to slip and just cut and dry and that's the piece I I actually respect Joey's comment like one does it show we put a kayak or any size boat in a beautiful sized slip I think that goes back to the original question I've always had what's the vision my vision Bellaire Beach isn't a bunch of smaller boats and beautiful wasted Commodities out there it's a real it's a really tough challenge but I think the focus should go back to uh how to satisfy the resident issue always have a backup for outside and I think I'll leave it in that if you're going down the right path with a discussion and I gotta look at Kyle I personally want Kyle's life to be made easier how do I make it easier for him instead of this subjective approach you gotta get the biggest boat it's rather so it's uh it's a pretty tough one would you any questions about understanding well my question would be is we put out there I got the biggest slip but I don't have the biggest boat is that offensive to other voters you know it's it's just uh I don't know I've been waiting wait a minute maybe I should say I've been waiting seven years for a slip too so yeah that goes back to another issue on how are you going to divvy up three different sizes for people that have been on this list once you've adjusted that'll be interesting answer your question uh you know immediately what went through my mind was Space Management and it just isn't efficient Space Management I mean if I'm running a warehouse I don't want to put the copy paper in one of my places I could put the copiers I mean so it just doesn't I understand it doesn't look right but I guess well yeah we wouldn't be cutting the price you know and that's your goal yeah I mean that's what yeah one thought and I'm just kind of really thinking about this this is a relatively complex issue um some officer voter service or not some of us are on the list some are not would it be irresponsible just to say look with complex issues we usually tend to form a committee or a you know a subset of us is to form one just for the peer issue to encounter the rates the waiting lists and then have them come up with a series of recommendations present to US versus us trying to promote cloth or experience trying to rewrite what many marinas are actively doing you know we get observed exercise was done yeah it's been done two or three times and we've never moved on and that's that's the problem is that uh no matter what enhance has by every scenario someone's going to get their feeling or if someone's going to build like the cities turn their back on them and uh and there's early situations where you can make people happy so this was a good starting point to give us something to think about and I know that we're not going to solve this in a day they took me two months to even have a conversation with Kyle because I really didn't know what would be the best medicine for our team and I certainly want our community to be first and I want the residents to be taken care of but I also understand that not every situation works out for everyone and and stop by the purpose of leading people out but I just also believe that uh there's going to be situations where you may have to wait longer let's just reverse the situation okay you've got a big boat all right and there's a narrow slip just because it's a narrow slip is that made it fair for that big boat to go in there he's in the same situation if you're sitting if you're setting certain standards for various size slips right well then now every civil industry let's see if he has the opportunity he has your boat he can always buy another boat to fit in this because he's next on the list he has that opportunity to um there's really no difference the only thing that's available are smaller I'm saying he can still buy another boat if he'd like and place it in there you can have two boats many people do I mean I'm just going through the list it's a secondary tertiary effect a big slip is available and he's on that list when he can buy a bigger boat too so I would like you to take time and write us a policy sure and you've got some ideas I want you to take this list I'll give it a shot yeah and you give us something and and work with no I agree Kyle if you don't mind and then at the next work session let's have this conversation again and I feel I would invite you to come here and and hear it in person yeah I'd be happy to help council members Angela there's a lot yeah it's interesting sometimes we think I think you better down turnover we're doing a little bit more on managing ordinances maybe that we don't have enough or two I think we have a lot of things around you know you should quote capable of moving is it aesthetically pleasing has it runs the slip empties there's a lot of things that other marinas do that create churn versus someone has retired and moved out of the city that we don't always have to wait for a turn and renewable less Ambassador there's a lot of things I really encourage you to look for that as well it's not a bad idea what you're doing with a designated a different lesson I think what's going through my mind is not the management of that it's just the fact that there's a current list so just for clarification does that mean that however people are on that list they immediately go into one of three buckets right is that the business I would think so yeah so maybe you know that just requires checking with people and communicating like you do every year you're going and scrubbing that list verify this is the way we're moving forward fill your your vote if you have it and so there's nothing wrong essentially they could pick any bucket they want to be hey you know I had a vision years ago you know making sure we're very pleased to see we're really close to that I mean we were at 56 no more than two and a half years ago so we pushed the revenue up quickly it would have kept going so try to maintain that number with what you're doing yes I think your rates are right on target with what you did 11 10 9 might be low I'll close up with this thought too you have an opportunity with that slip open you're also working with some contractors you know slip I think it is that could be two slips you know so you can throw a little piece down the middle and uh 26 orders in there so it always goes back to what's the big fish and unfortunately sometimes we start with a citizen come and we create a tornado and here we go off to the races so stick to the vision where do you really want to see 10 years 15 years I'll start with I think we should make it easier thank you for that opportunity [Laughter] I apply for a c-slip I've been on the list for five years I get a bigger boat so I notify you I need to now go to be ready do I go to the bottom of a bigger right I think you have to because otherwise you play games yeah if you're already in the marina you've had an opportunity to upgrade to a larger school I thought that was right about 49. that's a nice way at handling it only I mean you've got 18 slips it's not that many people to reach out you got a slip open up so now you're only 17 people you know send a letter we've got you know slip opening up if you have an interest in upgrading Latina give them 10 days to respond and then get things [Music] about ultimately trying to get to the goal of having all the slips to Resonance because we just felt like that's the right thing to do we've never even got to that part okay there was so much production of classifications and where are we just an estimate number of how many residents versus non-residential Puritans so just about two or three a little more than half it's done good afternoon [Music] um becomes available we have to have something in the audience at the time of that so now I've always wanted to do it so now I have that opportunity because an ace is available in the cell Montego and if my next deadline of the current School of owner to upgrade I think that would be the cool offer there you know um council members Abel uh whatever uh challenge you to do is got it and rather than tearing it apart I would say enhance it no I will and um that's what I was listening to conversation about the movement staff great ideas that we discussed about um what else what to do with residents and people that have rental properties but they don't live here how you identify and who is a beautiful how they should get pregnant treatment where you have all that information yes and the regulations of the Marine that are covered the city ordinance over the actual agreements that they signed that right and the administrative policy for the waitlist so it's kind of spread out that information is important um and then I have a lot of information through discussions with Mr Lusk of what other marinas do and a lot of considerations ideas to to [Music] uh that was an abortion what happened with the gentleman it came here and spoke but he's not the first person that's happened and I think about all the events happen to you before him right now we have certain policies in place and have a lot of that they had to step up and speak but I think about the other people until we have it in place it's kind of want to remind you got it yep we're definitely enhancing it and work with it as far as the opening right now do you want to we could reach out to the existing slip renters and see if anyone is interested in upgrading to the larger slip the one thing is you have to eat for somebody who uses it is already it's so much for you sorry we can look into sort of a legacy policy where existing slip Runners have an opportunity to upgrade to decide the size 19 foot beam slip 16. um but again that's a that's kind of a process so if somebody was say they have a list a lift in their current slip um I guess you could see what interests we have out there but we're going to have to define the criteria of how they move and how much time and all the relative process temporary policy my greatest to whatever let's see what it is sure because I don't want to see that as sitting in indeed okay [Music] um how do we prioritize that's another question of the people who are interested in the moving into so 16. we prioritize it by how long they've been in the marine or prioritizing by the size of their boat are they in the the a level size they're all oh they're all knee level no they're they're spread they're all different size books yeah because I'm thinking at least you know not for I'm writing the policy as I go here using the ABC structure that I would say that only those that are in the a can be approached for that perhaps put the word out I don't know it's uh yeah I'm just taking on the run here would you like yeah I think we all went through my mind yeah to make sure is this your current vote is this what you're thinking we're gonna make some changes so when they go into different categories yeah they know the numbers too [Music] still runners I like the idea there's an empty snow yeah unless it's two slips Okay so now writing that down you're gonna call out you know call some people in smaller slips great right now my mind says the start of the person who's been there give the opportunity the person who's been there the longest and then just go down to the newest person in there yeah and then it would create a domino effect which is okay yeah that's why I said 14 it was the 16 and then that's over now and yeah so much for making your job open and you've got someone that wants it really is what it comes down to is what you came to us with today you have 28 hotel but it's talking about that 32-foot vote and would like that stuff number four he'll pay the 32 foot price until he hits um and then you're going to repeat the process until basically like you said everybody's kind of fleeted up and then now you got true openings but again this is somebody who doesn't handle them doesn't like half of those yeah but it has not been on the list very long right I would advise you to have something in place before you start screwing around with with marker antennas okay and you've got a hustle if there's someone in mind that's helpful right now under the current policy the next person in life and then regular policy is finished and we can address now deal with everybody and that way it's full we got rid of all the numbers right well we're still not residents we haven't gone as far as but it prioritize always and we have established that they need to be residents not just property resident owners so that that is I believe they got a bigger boat and they're touring come on their summaried in Khan okay what's your joke this is only what 30 they had a 45 yeah so um I don't know what his plans are but he's going to pay that six months worth without the boat and I was going to make it clear that you must have the bubble no refunds so yeah I mean there's a lot to think about what regardless I don't think yeah I'm already thinking deposits and pays agreement to facilitate that right okay you can't do peace work on the policy and constantly change have someone else on in line that has a bigger boat because it's hoping that with the best Slip that's an issue it's not the language so we've got a 19th yeah it's cubic foot it's the biggest boat I have in hand right now is the 28 . yeah we've already right there good point there's always a bigger boat non-resident Reno we did we didn't have that Resident only and we opted Optics not resident Revenue both sizes Etc right you're going to be dealing with 28 foot 26 bullets 24 Footers 32 kilometers of which we all can fit in majority of Memphis lives well there'll be half the biggest money-making slip we might want to think about that yeah start thinking about building boat Towers we're looking at a big picture of what were we doing and is our goal resonant only forever which you know the Public's moving was somewhat rare as far as a resident has 45 footer that doesn't live and those folks live all right I'm gonna have to end the conversation and the reason why is because you're on public records and we can't hear you about I'll have you have to get up speakers we're just going to get you a little bell just give us it yeah lapel mic no I mean policy writer is like okay that's what we do any other uh before we move on to item number on that open slip and I think right now until the policy changes you have to treat it the way we've always treated it okay we're working we're working all right well there's another option I think the council has already spoken that we don't want to let non-residents ahead of residents do we have any maintenance we got to do on that one no no what this situation is with how this is all going to unfold but there's no as far as non-residents go I'm not loyal to them and if we currently don't have a resident ready to tell me that slip I don't want to commit five ten years whenever we're just right around the corners yeah or maybe time to do maintenance on that one slip if we were to get you know we're looking in the ballpark an average about 300 a month we could lose you know that's not a huge amount of money something because football we're going to get a policy worked out for assets they're definitely a heightened in the city I would like to challenge this Council to and from two to three months we were ready [Music] Ness of that slope so some really looking at square foot you know size [Music] because this is a valuable slip I mean I need to put it that way but it is I don't think it's big enough that you can make it too it's 19 feet with lifts yeah you got a left yeah lift and navigation foreign [Music] optimize actually you generate more Revenue I have two loads in there I think one large bow and you would also do it in that that area that's a sweet spot for Bel Air Beach residence which is about a 24-28 foot boat right just some things to considered for sure no optimization well that's like a business plan you just propose financially like we're doing now what would take to get to from A to B um and is it financially worth it at that point yeah well we got two islands out here we could use that now real quick on your list there so we did split that 19 foot width into a nine six and nine six to be right next to a line eight how many votes do we have on the list now that the residence ever fit in there that would be that c we're currently saying um so if you got nine and a half you got five both at the bottom of the listings for the residents well it's no fans are gone how they're um now they're secured in their boat there are a lot of things yeah more exactly insane they do hit each other with a lot available [Music] we have a policy issue [Music] [Music] because I also agree yeah that's a strategic why anything right yeah so I can get this policy out so we'll get a couple of sorter now like we never had this conversation yeah yeah where's my man in Black all right it's only like two pages wrap up I guess I can postpone item four because um like to get um Randy and I were talking about consent agenda for making a bank change um and this came from a proposal from Valley being um citizens advisory committee chair for ronce again and he has a lot of experience with this bank and then the surrounding banks in the area so you felt like this was a very good choice and the main reasons being that they're going to offer us the Target fed funds minus 50 basis points interests which is much better than that of our current band truest and they are also not driving us any bank service fees and currently you can get charged Sailors over our accounts which was from 500 to close and their interest is very low where they do a point four percent rate offset interest and then only give they've only given us 0.5 rate on the balance which is extremely low especially given interest rate never reached out to offer us anymore I'm sure if we negotiate they probably would do more but at this point I think we have a very good deal with Valley and he had a proposal um Heather and I met with Valley on May 5th and met the staff felt very good about the bank they told us they have a they're well qualified with an average of a score of 76 for the uh which is a qualified public depository rating with the collateral management office with the state so um they also offered if anyone has their direct questions about um that they can answer when we reach out and provided but a brief question about right now we're undergoing bank failures do they have a parent company uh what's their track record what's their asset Center management because frankly governments have gone under for just this reason they look for a short-term interest gain or maybe a slightly favorable look for personal checkbooks and it was the back office their their loans at the bank has that put them in default I have a dad sheet so yes that worries me about Nationwide I've never heard of the bank frankly but Nationwide activities [Music] who was it before Valley oh is there only yeah no they're the best thing I don't you know and full disclosure I mean I don't want to be interviews of being involved no no just a general question they are um and this branch is great I mean I literally have a branch manager cell phone on my phone and anytime any money transfer I call them anything I need I just call them directing hands is it very well run very feels like a Community Bank so we're still under FDIC Etc well our our rates are higher being a government institution then they have to ask you I don't have the exact numbers on that though they're higher the insurance on you any other cities using them or are we the only one government office accounting firm okay I noticed it says the rate index will remain in effect until April 30th 2023. whoops that doesn't give me a real warm feeling about there that's why I I look at bags and failures yeah um possible yeah I think it's basically what they're saying I'll clarify this is that they don't get adjusted with the federal funds right okay I mean their letter went out April 25th I'm just curious are we concerned about that and um the intention is to put again put this in the next council meeting thank you and it would be a transition process obviously would be opening your accounts and moving and strategically you know as we have to change our direct deposits uh structure funds and some of our payments all that stuff I need our purchasing cars this is the initial recommendation it came up in our overall CIP um analysis of what we're seeing where our where our money like where are we getting held and what the interest uh any discussions of like talk about the bond issue the card billion interest rates rising or comparing you know what interests we'll be paying versus how much would be making on our assets [Music] smaller localized things because they're offering for February we have truest um and then we'd be able to encounter with this and then the only right now our capital and I don't know why is like this our uh our capital with Bank United so we plan on keeping it there for now but if things work well and transmitter operator it comes over the valley that would be the intention it doesn't make sense to have all these separate Banks it doesn't Bank United mortgage though is that no that is we'll have to keep an account okay we did the stress test does this require a resolution um I don't believe so Randy answer I'm looking at your past documents I haven't seen one adopted previously as to how it goes if it comes before you um a next meeting and a resolution is required one will be prepared I have not prepared it today as of yet Kyle and I were just discussing this earlier today and I just received the documentation but if it requires a resolution trustingly a resolution will be before you for that purpose [Music] if it's a resolution you don't need any ads or anything like that so it really just comes down to you and Kyle and I specifically spoke about timing this morning and when we discussed it you know just noted that given where we are in the month meeting off cycle our next period was only two short weeks away so that gives us you know that's that's not a significant delay there were no time pressures that he felt needed um I'm not aware of any clarification on the rate and through our discussions or meetings I did not feel any time in history honest okay yeah and they're not under the stress test Court I reached out to a man communicated that I was taking into the sports session yeah either way for both [Music] Mr Mayor since we still have 30 seconds left I think uh yeah it's pretty simple yeah that's what pages and it's a draft test failures yeah definitely the idea behind this again is the city manager goal um to to kind of come up with a policy for uh seeking out grant funding for like our capital projects or it could even pertain to our operating budget but um I just started with you know just defining what this admin policy what it's for um and then kind of in the policy procedures section uh talked about um sources of of monitoring grants which was uh we joined the the FLC our grants assistance program that was brought up and it was like four or five months ago so they provide an email and a website assistance with everything that it's on the national scale of all the grant opportunities comes through and then um I I'm in subsection would be a kind of brought up that every time that a uh we're considering a project that it would be the city manager's responsibility to to look for alternative alternate sources of funding and you know I've listed out Grant programs that we've looked at in the past and that we've worked with put in applications and I think with the with grant funding um sometimes it's tough for us to meet all the criteria but it doesn't mean we should ever stop trying because it it's my mindset there's a lot that keeping up um relations with the correct coordinators and the regional directors of these grants and sometimes um when they don't allocate all the funds they do lower qualifications open up because they do want to distribute the money so I kind of wrote that summarize that um and and I also covered the ongoing grants that you know they're not much but we do them every year and I think that if it's money if it's a program that gives us money back then we show those things you can do it and it just kind of talks about who um it's a sign so it um hoping in the future that you know we just have a longer list of money that we're getting these are the ones that are currently on your radar correct yes and like I said with the um so we get right now we have a magic safety Grant and then we have the Pinellas County um recycling Grant and we always um but like I said right now I'm currently working with that hurricane em Hazard mitigation program um foreign project trying to come up with enough creative benefit um through as much residents that work from home and the money that they injected the economy took their jobs and I mean any way we can try and meet a benefit ratio for the cost of the products in that a legal Savings Program we just get that as remembers yeah you brought it up in one of the meetings and I joined it and it's it's a program that just kind of keeps keeps the neighbor to the ground but like almost some grad school you've never even heard from anybody for all over the country it's just you know it's just a good it's a good consolidation keep those ideas and opportunities you know to show them suite and it gets to Performance any comments or suggestions other questions let's go good job and like I said this admin policy is something that we can we can write and do it at any point okay thank you so much for uh reminding me that we still had that one item left 30 seconds until it passed it on knocked it out anything and uh give it a second of course"
