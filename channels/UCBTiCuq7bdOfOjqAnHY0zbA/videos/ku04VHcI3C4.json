    "transcript": "foreign good afternoon everyone I'd like to call to order the May 23rd parking record the role today is Miss Tammy lavenda I'm here miss Patty Roberts here and Deborah decasimo here okay and we're trying to call John Wagner on the phone so he might be calling in off of Silence sorry we're starting a couple minutes late and then either Kyle riesler or Aaron Landers shortly so early sorry lots of paperwork you guys all have this yes hi Sean um agenda item number one is to approve today's agenda yes [Music] okay so do you have the agenda in front of you yeah Patty emailed it um when she yeah um I'm shooting it over to you right now because mine doesn't disappear when I accept Ed um we'll get it together you know I don't have your email John I just have your um I'll screenshot it and I will picture how about that that's okay I'll just send it to you and you can blow it up there's nothing much on it okay there you should have it and we just um we literally just got through we just approved today's agenda and then um we're on agenda item number two is approval of the April 13th Park and record meeting and I move that we do not approve until the change is made on page five there was a mirror yeah John on the minutes um they call me Patty Wagner [Laughter] that's what I said so they're changing it it literally says Paddy Wagner and John Wagner in the same sentence okay so once that um correction is made can I have a motion to approve last month's agenda um okay I moved it it it's approved as long as the change is made okay and may I have a second second all in favor aye okay so last month's agenda is passed and then we have no citizen six so we're going to skip number three I have a quick question sure so do I need to include John in the approval of the agenda is he approving the agenda as well John are you good with today's agenda okay so I'm going to change it to 4-0 and he's present via the telephone okay okay and then agenda item number four is inventory of the Bellar Beach logo merchandise are you ready yes beach towels 13. license plate six she's writings hats six khaki and six gray so we got the second color in stock so that's great and we only have six of each because the last time I just took it because I was looking at the welcome bags and we had like the whole pack so they sold it was just so long okay hand towels eight did not see any kitchen towels we don't have kitchen towels okay they're just in the bags okay um and two belly bags and 11 stickers it was hi Mr Roberts you guys good how are you good I'm dropping off the most important piece of equipment thank you very much you're very coordinated today with your hat and your shirt we're right at citizen Commons if you'd like to make a comment you're more than welcome right now are you good I'm just going to call laws of stripes that sounds good okay um it was that it was that everything that was everything now I did I did do the bags but I think that comes down here oh the welcome bags okay yeah we can come to that later and then um we are going to skip agenda item number five for now we're going to move it down to the bottom because and I want him to review the community services start the park surveys okay and then so back to the inventory on the number six the inventory for the welcome bags I just have four of the Bellaire Beach kind and four of the Publix kind okay and that's perfect because they should be coordinated I contacted Publix again to see if they wanted to do something for the next round because Kyle those are still from Jam Feb March so we have basically probably four condos that haven't picked them up because they're they have renters um so and they didn't get back to me so like you know just again whenever you're out and about if you're with someone just maybe ask if they would like to donate it's not even a donation would you would you hide your business in our welcome back to our new residents because it's really not a donation it should just be part of their advertising if they so choose to participate it is no big deal it's whatever they don't have to be the same every time the bat if we have six bags in there they don't have to be the same either because everybody just gets one if that makes sense so I think Kyle's gonna do because we we have on average probably two to three new residents a month a month or two months yeah so it's not like that many so I don't think he's doing it every single month John can you still hear me okay okay great yeah based on people with typical bedroom would typically know if we're doing this um is there any way it seems like a nice opportunity uh but you gather these uh direct directions yes it's just when I was out and about doing my you know errands or whatever I would ask wherever I was and then couple of them I just knew from the health and wellness fair and I either have their email or you know their cell phone so I would send them a text or an email so yeah it's just kind of nothing systematic about it just it would pop into my head if I was out running around okay yeah I'm thinking just thinking of a way to uh the information out there to them so it can be a little bit more passive activity and uh maybe uh you know they're calling in and wanting to do it rather than rather than having to do Outreach yeah we can look into that we only need like 10 every three months so you know that this is working that's great yeah I mean I don't know I don't know if it's working or not like I could for example for like the goal one we got from Gold's Gym is by far the best it was a six month free membership he would be like a Primo person for me to ask to say hey have you had any new members from you know new residents from Bellaire Beach but otherwise like I don't know if it's doing them any good or not I mean it can't hurt them so I just don't want to make it a big deal it's you know we don't need a bunch of people seeking us out I don't really want to post an ad or anything like that it's just you know the places you go to yeah just word of mouth is just because we don't need that many and like I said because it doesn't have to be like cut and dry the same I think just and we don't even have to do it at all like if there's nothing in the welcome bag at all it doesn't matter they don't know so right I just I like I said like when we talked about this in the past I don't want it to be a stressful thing or someone's like oh my gosh I forgot it doesn't matter you know I mean like if we have it great if we don't I guess all right so now we have Kyle and Aaron Aaron yay say hi to China hi John yeah yeah we're good we're good um okay so now that Aaron and is back we're gonna go back to agenda item number five for the review of the month and you may not have this in front of you Sean but we'll email it to you because I don't have it on email either you didn't email the stuff to people right [Applause] here I'm sorry I'm not allowed to email you Aaron will email you yes you are you could probably you could have probably done this project okay John how are you doing sir sure did yeah sure did so we got that handled for you or at least our code enforcement did so um so I took the uh on the corruptive action uh the basically the um reviews that you guys did of all of our parks and I I put that all into basically the the um kind of in order what was really kind of necessary what was something that was reasonable at this point what we could do uh and I I unincluded stuff that we basically do on a regular basis as far as lawn mowing and we uh you know edging and so on and so forth um so what I've got here is I've got our 2023 Park and Recreation board that corrective action list and based off of the reports that were submitted um you know I've already got four of those done specifically um with the 20th Street Park report it was uh essentially adding seashell to the sea wall the trees and a park bench area that was observed on the 3rd of April completed on the 11th of May the 25th Street Park the seashell refreshing that was observed on the 10th of April completed on the 21st of May uh hibiscus Park uh it was replenished The Mulch and shawl um that was observed on the 11th of April and completed on the 12th of May and the first three part the seashell replenishment again that was observed on the 11th of April completed on the 11th of May so green is green is complete okay you're missing the completed word there yellow is scheduled um so and that's right now uh the Public Works crew uh they have a list of of these items and uh that is a task once they're done with the needs of the city you know the the standard maintenance the lawn mowing so on and so forth uh these are the projects that they are working on and I think I spoke well I didn't I don't think that you and I both spoke about uh Morgan Park that we are going to be repainting that I spoke with Kyle about it um we went with your recommendation on the colors so we're gonna be repainting that building uh the door um we were I looked at the the curbing uh there for the handicap it's still in good shape there's no need to repaint it because it's essentially new um so that's going to be our next uh major uh project if you will at least Morgan Park um and that's what I've got for us right now all the rest that I've got here John and I know you can't see and you'll get a copy of this uh in the yellow again as scheduled projects uh the word scheduled is actually um I don't have a specific date but it's a on the agenda to get done and once it's done I am notified and that's what I annotate that date onto this report and then the blue was TBD you call it purple uh no the blue is just what was on on Excel I don't know yeah so I don't know um well like say for like example First Street Park broken Seawall rebar exposed what what category would that fall under so right now that's a half up in here because that's which one I'm sorry so that's why I said TBD yeah the ones that aren't marked the ones are marked are right now are things I still need to look into and so to figure out TBD correct okay so I can I camp another color there but I just cut the blank that way it just that wasn't popping out right now yeah yeah so it's either completed scheduled or to be determined that's that's fair enough sure you're talking about Morgan painting the the building the bathroom building correct and did you guys decide I'm sorry um we talked about maybe possibly doing a mural out there if if I could find someone that would do it free or for just the cost of the paint or something would you be interested in that or do you know hurricane Eddies yeah beautiful Hibiscus flower and Hibiscus bushes are right there and then all the way around she's got alligators and things like that so I was trying to get the person's name from Hurricane Eddie's and the guy that was in there had to wait till the owner and haven't seen him since but um something like that I would wouldn't it be on the parking lot side or the beach side of the whole building well I was on the parking lot side is where I was visualizing but if she wanted to do it all the way around is it hard to maintain or how do we well I don't know because I don't know anything about it I'd have to ask the artist that kind of thing but theirs is on the outside is outside stuff I wouldn't think it would fade and ship any faster than them any other things that you're going to put on there yeah I feel like there's some sort of special coating they put over it to make it last longer but yeah probably some varnish or something or a laminate type of paint yeah to protect from the UV I'm assuming so it doesn't fade right but can I before you paint it can I see more if I can find somebody well they can paint like the base at the neck pain over the base because it's they can't just paint over what's there now because it's really yeah so it needs a basement it needs a base anyway okay and um can you maybe email them the colors yeah I will um so the colors that we that we had extended out asking some advice on um was kind of a kind of a little darker blue a little bit maybe it's smidge darker than issue I have the pictures yeah okay so yeah it's kind of like in the middle of these two uh colors but she's got them it's a Sherwin Williams paint by the way yeah Patty that's what I was going to rudely interrupt you to say I was what happened in Clinton oh we can get it I can knock it out yeah okay so it's um vast guy and then the this brown is more the color of the men and women as opposed to the it's the brown that the doors are now is kind of like a it's a weird color um so that's the Brown that's the blue so you could paint like you could paint it was perfect and as a base um so the doors will be Brown so if you look at this right now see how the door is kind of like this is like more like the brown of the paint this is more like right it's a more of a rusty and then there's um hopefully these can see they're all rusty and gross they're hopefully going to be white okay gorgeous bro but so the metal frame or the where it's rusting you you're coping handles no she's talking about the vent I mean it's either all brown yeah I don't think it'll be brown I mean I don't think it'll be white it won't say it won't just say brown yeah yeah it might be easier I think it's really good it depends how bad it leak Road it is maybe they sell aluminum ones that won't corrode they might yeah and I mean everything's with those buildings are pretty standardized we just got to pull up the old plants and get a replacement still there John yeah I'm still here does anybody have any questions about it I'm colorblind so I don't feel qualified all right then we want emails oh all right never mind it's not it's not it's all chipped up too it's more gray I think he wants to know why I figured the same probably the blue inside and out yeah oh you will do blue on the inside too no that's what you're saying probably the same what would you do it on the inside probably keep it with a gray that way the guys can see if there's any dirt or anything it'd be easier for them to spot that yeah I think the blue gets a little dark in there maybe what I wanted well there's no light that's an idea we could do whatever white is fine kits in the office I wanted to do like the epoxy you know of course Reddit garage floor type yeah like the pebble looking stuff yeah so we do have that already that oh that's great because then the chip and then shows so much what shades are they I mean because you can get that in like great Shades of Gray shades of tan Shades of Black I want to say it's a gray a gray oh yeah so maybe just do the walls like a nice light gray then if the floor like you said there's no Lighting in there so I mean that um when they try to clean it it could be much easier for them to see like I said I mean if you got some someone gets down a wall they're gonna need to see it yeah people who are like John who are colorblind wouldn't be able to see that type of mess so I think all right does anybody have any other questions or comments on the corrective action list from our Park surveys no but I would say I like to say thank you for the fence on uh First Street of South Park is that what it's called yeah South Park it is really you can tell the difference in the grass already yeah you see golf carts turning away and parking across the street we sure have time again it's working granny and Justin thanks Grady and Justin thank you are these new Aaron and Kyle benches back here by the playground no by the playground just a thought uh can we we just like we okay so we put together this compendium these reports and with these pictures I don't know if I I don't know if all the um well I think there were 16 discrete reports and I believe uh dad you had pictures uh with yours I don't know um oh most of most of most of the reports had pictures are you going to do pictures after is there any does that make any sense I so all the photos that that I've received have been printed out and placed into a binder uh including the reports and that's how this uh how I ascertain this information to put into this corrective action list um I think he's asking for like the pictures before and after yeah um paint it after you paint it blue take a picture maybe maybe yeah more like a project like Morgan Park but um unless unless everyone wants we can um I just don't know realistically what the good of doing that would be hey John honestly we can do it like in our next Park survey you know I mean like like if it's corrected in this survey you know like the next person that surveys it it should be like this looks great it's you know because it was corrected on this action list so it'll get done it'll just take a little time is that okay yep okay so nothing was left off girl there's things that are not on there that are that were on the um reports that were sent were just standard you know maintenance so I left all that off because that's weekly done so yeah it just may be like you know they hadn't done it in 10 days of the survey right so that's probably how that got on there that's how I and that's how I let those off did I see the bicycle rack on here um I saw it somewhere yeah the bicycle rack is under Tom Morgan Park um to paint yeah there it is yellow yeah but you are still looking into the plastic ones because I read that somewhere too or maybe it's just in the minutes I did look in the plastic ones uh they're eight hundred dollars um so at this point right now I'm I think painting it for now and maybe revisiting it next year is uh more physically physically correct or right now with the budget that we got for that so is it the same size uh it's actually a little bit smaller yep is that the only park that has a bike rack that type of bike rack yes we had one over here it was never used we didn't get rid of it we just pulled it over to the Works house with the idea that we might refurbish it for the use of the bike rack but it never really got used at Bayside um you can look into the recycled plastic though but later in the summer if we have a little room that was when I was 800. yeah yep because I was I think when I was pricing the metal ones like just got to be steel ones like you're getting around 500 600 so it wasn't that's not too much yeah just you know it's relatively the same size I mean we can look at it it was it's basically four inches smaller uh uh I don't that's I don't know that question or the answer that question's first how many slots I just know the length that's how many Bucks I don't know do people use it I've seen several I've seen a few bikes on there before uh I think tops three that I've ever seen but I'm not here every day so I do chat to Morgan Park you know when I do my rounds uh daily so I do check that area so okay cool well I think that was good progress thank you thank you very much because you guys and then maybe um should we do it next meeting or the meeting after that like the next round of review yeah so what I will do is you'll see or it says percent uh complete we're at 17 so far that number is going to be higher um so what I will do in this case since we've discussed this I'm going to change the green to um would it be like we like to magenta this is too dark yeah it's too dark as it is you can hardly read in the green something lighter it's okay can't read it maybe we should do a salmon color like there you go okay yeah [Music] so if you get either red or green we could do I will swap out the green with a more um I have all those too see small and dark I guess the size is I can't I can't even read this so okay so maybe we make the font a little bigger um I'm sure we can try I that'd be great just trying to fit it on to one page yeah yeah but you have some room so even if these double you know wrap around and and and put a key okay I like that idea well this was uh we printed this out today um so but I like that idea yeah it probably has a phone in the house right absolutely all right sorry guys on number five if nobody has anything else we've already done number six so now we're to agenda item number seven so um Kyle and I had a meeting mayor Gaddis in regards to the mayor's chili cook update and you know we had changed it from November because November you know we got a lot of feedback that it was just too busy the holidays Thanksgiving travel we have a house full of people we can't make it otherwise we'd love to so then we put it on December 10th and we like really thought about it it's kind of the feedback was the same it's the same thing so Kyle looked at the available um dates so February 3rd which is a Sunday 2024. so it's kind of in the playoffs right yeah I like that it's Sunday perfect or is it a Sunday where there's no game is it a Sunday I thought it is a Sunday Sunday February 3rd I think it's before Super Bowl because you said any serious football you're right it's right in between it's right before the Super Bowl but for some reason I was thinking he picked a Saturday so the sun I think you gave him the choice that you gave him that weekend it is the third Saturday it is yeah I think it's Saturday oh okay well this is Sunday so I don't know I probably did that so Saturday February 3rd and that's the weekend in between yeah I think that's right yeah because first of all you should have done it on a Sunday because the men have nothing to do that week now because there's no football they're going to be like what do we do now chili would have been perfect I'm sure there's going to be a to-do list yeah that's true exactly okay did you have a time it's still 12 to two twelve to two thank you so the two the time stayed the same it's just we moved it like three what two months later right so out of the holiday yeah and you had I put 11 because we'll have to be here at 11 yeah okay well then shut up so so it is February 3rd Sunday right Saturday Saturday yes it's a Saturday okay yeah so we should add that to our skip we should add that to our calendar because I fully attend I fully intend to be there competing absolutely um did you speak about changing the format a little bit this year yes we did and we are going to definitely have more discussions about that okay and the mayor said he's going to be more involved this year we're going to do a lot more advertising on his end an RN we're not going to pre-sell tickets because it didn't get us anywhere except for stress and I still want to um have a banner going across the road a banner across the right one that we can like maybe change have a basic and then add like this week it's the idea well I don't think we could do we've talked about the banner across the road I don't think we could do it because Kyle why can't we do it we've talked about that because they don't own the polls well no but you can get permission I wouldn't do it we said that um was it expensive or I don't know medical look into putting it up we need to have a high enough lift um again I don't know the condition of that wire it's probably a good idea to check on that anyways I mean and how many years ago they actually put it up intention of hanging down wait where where are you thinking so you're not talking about like as you're sitting at the red lights like right out here in front of us oh okay yeah in front of instead of having it on the front of the building where you can't see unless you go like this and then you're gonna crash into the pond that's true you know if you're going across the bridge you see it because we want more than Bella Beach people here don't we is it a fundraiser I mean we can make it a fundraiser but we always struggle with the we want more than Bellaire Beach people here we've kind of made it word of mouth because we we Circle back to the parking and there's no street parking and then if we do invite it out to you know what I mean like we never have more than we can accommodate we never have but like the one time that we did post the beach cleanup somewhere where it got to everyone we were turning people away and we didn't have enough parking there was 45 people there and probably 10 cars left so we only put it in their ad one time and yeah we had to take it back out and this is another point we started doing community events important Point some of the residents growing up for the day and they wanted them to be for the Beach Community okay and their guest now that we're shutting people down right for control kind of like how much is coming in I guess not over advertised yeah so it's Bellaire Beach like residents and their guests and we've never turned anybody away but we also don't like advertise to the masses if that makes sense because we as much as we'd love to have them we can't accommodate them with either parking or we are going to try to get people we have to have people sign up for the if you're gonna make chili we do need to um know that in advance because we can't come here Saturday the third and oh we only have three chilies you know so like we do need to get that pre like we need to have that list but we don't have to resell tickets we didn't really sell a lot of tickets last year and it was a struggle it was a struggle no one wants to do something that we open up for their broader areas yeah register I just know my neighborhood did not know what anything about it unless I knocked on their door specifically they knew nothing about they'd never heard of it and I know it's on the sign and things like that and it's on the website it was on next door but they don't know the chili cook-off yeah was that after no it was on there I got something on this it was on it was on the um thing that we put on everyone's door it was on every single person's door see I don't remember that I had to check what I thought it was yeah you had all your events listening oh that's right because we talked about doing that but that's to say when we did the mailer yeah right yeah let's throw that out exactly so that's why I was thinking about a banner no Banner is good and I say Bellaire Beach residents why don't we just do a anime blast about it to the residents we always we do that for our costume it was chili cook-off holiday social health and well yeah see the mine's working again good job well there was a period where it wasn't so we're happy to have it back oh yeah anyway so yeah no it's a great idea if we can find somewhere to hang it I know I think what we talked about that got Nina was like when you're sitting at the red light like because that Bella Shore area isn't ours to hang it from what they're talking about there's two concrete holes that were installed specifically with a wire oh it exists out there okay I don't ever been used I don't know how old it's been like been there but it was installed for that if that was yeah and again I would probably ask Patty if she knows any history that would have been a good Lin question I didn't even know it was maybe we could do a field trip afterwards might know information on if it was just negotiated with the utility company but it was put there for that purpose the idea but I I don't know I didn't know used her again or the condition of that wire so would it be something like okay say the wire's in great shape you know how we just get the grommets on the end if we got multiple grommets can we weave it in and out or no because there's a lot of tension oh so you tie it yeah but then you gotta have something that's gonna that's what I mean like so I didn't know if you had multiple it's only one wire so again that the wind I don't know how they designed it or what the idea because I didn't how do you keep the bottom from flapping yeah most banners grommets yeah okay so the attention to keep it and then we you know we get some windy windy yeah yeah and and couldn't it say so I'm like Belair Beach residence instead of just you know well you know how many phone calls we get about that I think I think we did a lot about being you know you know is that the right yeah so we don't that's what we are being yeah we want to try to avoid that we'll say if you have any problems with they call Patty Wagner residents uh yeah I mean you know honestly like it's the mayor's chili cook-off we've never said Bellaire Beach residents only and we've never had a like a plethora of other people show up I think we're gonna be fine just not pointing it out shining a light on it yeah so I think we're okay um but yeah I mean that would be great I thought she met so it didn't sag in the middle but like from the bottom too yeah that would be awesome if we could use that I can figure out how high that is and then we're gonna have to expect it to see what we're looking at so yeah I think it's a good idea uh safety wise because it's a good point when I start thinking of the condition of the wired and to make sure that we don't have a liability well I just is it high enough to wear like one of those big huge trucks like that are building the house down the street from us come under it that it's is it that high well that's what it is pretty high it's pretty I mean I'm only picture in a banner that's only going to be like yeah so yeah you don't want to sail them and if we can't do that another suggestion is like when we have our um garage sale put some of those out before the cook-off can we do that on our streets every year we don't have a signed code right now yeah if it's on private property even the current sign you know what we have in place now in the one that we're proposing it hasn't it still offers that people get to put their sign of whatever it says on their property so I think if the if the person who owns the lot agrees to it it could be done how about at our parks and yeah of course instead of putting it on people's properties we've done about five signs we stuck it on on the public property in the Parks so we are following our ordinance like for instance um on the pickleball courts here I've seen like you have some man who comes and gives tennis lessons or something and he puts a sign like courts closed today it's like this little slip of paper yeah so maybe you could just do that in some locations yeah it doesn't even have to be fancy just uh notice right one of the other Parks yeah I was going to say one of the other Parks out of Baltimore maybe get them laminated or put them in a sheet and put them up well that's Morgan and so that's public so that would be other than Bel Air residents that's okay I think it's not a bad idea doing I think it would grab people's attention especially if they're in people's yards because people would be like yeah at least everybody on my street would know without me having to knock on their door I mean the whole world makes a right up my house so the whole world right sorry I'm gonna drive really fast past your place now [Laughter] fishing poles over to one of the parks and I said I'm just going to let you know you're not allowed to park on the street you're probably going to get ticketed there's a park literally on the other side of this house and they said thank you and walked away with their fishing poles just today just now we're on my way here call the cops and say come get them yeah we'll just call awesome we'll tell them do it he's there is it is Joe working yeah yeah where do you live oh Harbor Drive 105. hold on yeah the cops used to sit in my driveway that's how many people pass that stop sign oh yeah they would sit in the driveway and the cops would still pass them and they'd still go through the stop sign yep they're pulling people over left and right now though I see them good they just saying don't do that anymore are they giving them tickets are they just giving them warnings well it always comes out of their discretion but if they're getting somebody who's got multiple warnings they're going to get a ticket you know if people are mean or rude about it they'll ticket you but or if they smell like them yeah but they do record their warnings so oh they do they do yeah oh okay yeah because I've got my license plate and yeah have been given an organization you said to me okay this is in the system now so watch what you're doing going forward that's when I was speeding over the bridge at John's Pass when I thought I missed the light and I was going thought it was going to open so I gunned it and came off the bridge doing like 60. and got pulled over and did you get a warning or take it John you're not laughing at you I did get a warning because the guy he knocked on my door and he said do you know what happened I said I didn't know what to do I thought the bridge was going to open everything was ringing when I was on top and he was like too much too much bring it down so much take a deep breath lady are we good on the chili cook-off we'll have many more discussions about that obviously it's only made it so no motion yeah other business other business um the only thing I would say and I will email because this is kind of for Aaron So like um Beach cleanup we all um so it didn't make her sign the electric sign last month so we need to make sure it's on the sign like I'm gonna suggest this Saturday before so like it can be put on a Friday so it hits the weekend before the weekend that we actually do it um so I'm gonna ask him in the emails about that it will because it won't be as many weddings but yeah yeah get it out there oh yeah that's a good point yeah we just have four people yeah four people last time I think so no that's okay something like that I even brought a guest with me yes from New York to clean our beaches yeah yeah we had four or five people I mean it wasn't I mean but you know it's time of year too so I don't know I just thought it didn't make this nice week to make sure of that but otherwise it's just it is mm-hmm protein bars yep and donuts and donuts and it was on next door as well yes and Facebook run Joe so Tammy Tammy you only had uh well you only had a handful of people on um first Saturday huh yeah four or five but it was fine I mean the beach wasn't that dirty honestly we found more toys than anything we were uh we got to be picky about what we kept and what we recycled what'd you do with the toys well they're they're supposed to be mascots for our meeting here they come well so Johnny you know Johnny the Pelicans so she found a rocket but I can't find Johnny he must be in the other bag so no it's gonna be Johnny Johnny Rocket and then we have a shark and we have a turtle right and I have a frog if you're interested so we're collecting the critters um does anybody else have any other business um just a quick question the uh the Pinellas Pinellas or the um Bridge cleanup the bridge cleanup yeah is that the second or third Saturday in July I want to say it's the third third okay yeah I think it's July 15th so I don't know if that's the second or third but I will look my big book that's the third it's the third yeah third Saturday okay all right I'm sorry because I have to get down there one or two of these so you can do it earlier because of the heat are you going to change it to eight instead of nine because of the heat I know somebody said that at the last one okay that's not part of parks and record what what uh or Taffy is that activity is that part of our Parks and Rec deal or is that or is that a different um a different venue that we do that the bridge cleanup on the bridge cleanup is the Community Foundation but but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter yeah we work hand in hand with them anyway so yeah oh sure um do we have uh do we have like a um or are we considered putting together kind of a an overall uh calendar I guess this is a bunch of question for uh Kyle and Aaron as it is our uh committee and just because there's a lot of things that are going on it'd be nice to just have a monthly or a quarterly schedule that came out they had one thing here's all the different things are going on we have something like that how far out I mean we do the newsletter by um bi-monthly so we do stick in the upcoming events that follow pretty much to their next newsletter well maybe what I could do is gather all the dates yeah that we have going forward and maybe somewhere include them in the minutes once or twice so we could if you want to do it calendar I mean once you get the dates together like sort of for the year I mean we can send out an extra event email to copyright if you think that would be helpful okay well the speech cleanup is first Saturday of every month that's what is the yeah I mean we don't really have enough going on I mean it would be Beach cleanup a lot of yoga and then you know we really only have three or four events to cover the 12 months I mean we don't have really enough to do a monthly calendar um like we could do like a one-pager that's got like you know a recap of everything and like we could fit everything on one page Patty does a really good job on the city's website on our park and rec board page of getting everything that we have listed out so it's kind of like a one-pager so she does it in the community newsletter which she email blasts out to everybody but we do have a calendar of sorts on our webpage for the city park and rec webpage sure in other words it already exists I just haven't uh thought to like other people that you haven't looked at what's in black and greens or red and green so you probably haven't been able to see it no it's a dread or green Yeah it's red look on the parking or uh I should look on the park and rec board um section of the city's website and I think you'll find what you're looking for yeah we'll change the font color it's in you can yeah I'm pretty sure that it's what you're asking for is there okay because I just I just like to have the stuff on my on my like monthly calendar I have it all punched in there then I look and I go okay you know what I said and I just thinking about going out farther than a month or two that's all all right I will look that up and I'll uh inform myself before I have any other questions on that okay no worries um thank you does anybody have anything else no but we do need to backtrack and let them know about the agenda which Patty kind of did but we need to let them know I'm sorry that the minutes were wrong and can we just initial it and get that signed like initial the change on it yeah okay so pen in the change and then initial that that's perfect and um uh Lloyd stepped into the meeting but I didn't announce him in any way do I put him down as a citizen as a guest citizen okay [Laughter] um see that's when the brain wasn't working yeah yeah it's so funny I'm glad you could join us today we were talking about the goals for this recipe [Music] which I think maybe you know aside from a gazebo I know somebody years ago but possibly even in Louisville gazebo because it seemed like the biggest uh justification for was heat so we've all seen those things we have that very cool material kind of deal that's you know yeah so the weddings are going on or other events and it's um you know 92 degrees that thing would help a lot there's so stuff the events that are going on in there but anything gazebo or something like that we just want direction or assistance to see if there was a justification for that so are you talking about around this circle yeah anywhere in the park where you guys thought it was evil time the grass area yeah through circles the grass area will be buggier but like that's where we were doing the Halloween parade and stuff and it was hot up there like sure was it hot that day yeah well we had what do we have two tents now we have two or three tens up for that reason like people yeah yeah is it with the sale talking about like the sales right yeah extremely better well I don't know I'm jumping in but I I like the idea he's asking for everybody's opinion I think it would look very nice I think it would get used 99.9 of the time by people who rent out the building for the weddings I think it would you know for either like so because it's a lot like how um we had Deb's birthday at Morgan Park and Kyle had made the comment that hardly any residents use it for this and so like when you said that about the Gazebo it kind of in my mind seems like it might be the same thing like um we would love for residents to use it and maybe they I mean you just don't know though until you try for that facts should we pursue that it'll look nice is the playground the playground's not done no it's installed it is installed that's why I thought the benches were new because maybe you did just move them around because I just stood right here and I saw like all these benches and I didn't remember seeing them we got uh five inches of mulch coming so or the rubber mulch the fake stuff it's our thing it's not real wood oh it looks very nice suspects okay so it's a absorbs impact I can't well what are your thoughts on the Gazebo oh yes definitely or umbrella shade yeah I like the idea of power to say about the cover but not necessarily a gazebo because right because it's more flexible yeah and you know it just I think I've got a lot of use in general it will be more maintenance work with a sunshade than a permanent gazebo you'd have to take it down for in storms and things like that I think if it's what I'm thinking of oh yep oh okay yeah they're actually very easy to maintain usually they're in not like metal posts yeah that are anchored into the ground so um when you set up the wedding chairs it's on that Circle isn't it usually well yeah when we leave the chairs and they set those chairs up but yes they do typically put them right there in that Circle so I think I'd look great I think it would look beautiful there a nice touch yeah and does it have a floor if it's not a gazebo I picture like where you go yeah right that's where I said does it have a phone number yeah definitely flexibility for any kind of setup if you were to use it as like a cupboard seated area or something like that right ready as opposed to having a wood structure yeah Reddington Shores has one if you if you go down south you'll see over their playground Constitution Park uh they've got they've got one there uh now I know they were just replacing inside maybe off but uh they've had one on there um so yeah it might be up yeah it'll look nice and what would you do blue some type of you guys yeah because you don't want it to be too hot the color either it's a green to make it well I would say green to make it look natural but that's what I was thinking of the heat but I don't know if it would pull more heat and be in a little we all have specs out there too could be they'll say well you're in the temperature the ambient temperature is 92 or around I wonder if it varies by color like how she said dark colors if it has that like you know the white would be 80 and the Green's 82 and the blacks 86 or you know I mean like I wonder if they get that specific I can look into that yeah I'll what I'll do is I'll contact Bradenton Shores and see who they ended up contacting if they have to talk to about vendor was and go in that direction oh yeah I love that idea yeah nice Aaron volunteered thank you you betcha does anybody else have anything under other business okay so um next meeting Deb's about to be gone for quite some time yeah and you know what I'm gonna hold them in but um yeah when do you leave I leave June 3rd and I don't know I'm sorry June 8th and I come back June 28th and I'm leaving the week of the 4th of July as well okay I'll watch your boat you watch my vote for me and I'll watch her vote as well okay I was a marine patrol officer so it is in good hands okay you can usually do that we can do it where I skipped the meeting and get an excused absence but then John's not here and that makes it tough well if John's available by phone yeah um we're talking about the next meeting in June yeah what about the 29th Thursday the 29th you're would that be too much if you're coming in the 28th I have um yeah my day's packed already okay I could do with the 30th if it's you know I can't do it I'm starving I'm sorry um Patty what works for you I don't see anything but my mother's doctor appointment so and that's like early in the morning no I mean like what if you had your preference of any day like from the 12th on what would you choose oh I know it needs to be a Tuesday on Thursday right Tuesday or Thursday 13 15 20 20. I mean I could do the six but it's kind of soon yeah it's too soon John do you have a preference of the 20th or the 22nd I think either one's fine I kind of like if it's possible um in order to do the same today's Tuesday right yes yes yeah makes it makes it easier things are kind of on the same day yeah uh if that's possible but I certainly can do 22nd also my brother should be Tuesday the 20th okay well then your preference is we're going to go with your preference John Tuesday the 20th at 2 pm excellent and it's okay for me to schedule like do I schedule an absence do I just tell you yeah okay yes yes are you in another zero eight hundred Zulu you're Central oh I'm familiar with Chicago time zone that's right you're uh that's right your Chicago land yes um and Tammy the uh uh the bridge cleanup is the 15th then is that correct yes of July Bridge cleanup so will somebody be able to do the minutes yeah okay okay forum is uh at least three of us I suppose huh yes okay all right yeah and honestly like when I'm gonna put the agenda together and if we don't have a whole lot on it maybe we just skip next month because I I'm like looking at what we have and you know so I'll let you guys know we might just have a free month but we might have we could also tentatively um uh competitively we could set up something in July just so we have a backup deal anyway yeah that's a good idea um yeah why don't we just look at look at July because it does slow down here a little bit right and you know what John I thought of that when you said that if we're going to keep a consistent day every single time I prefer to be on a Thursday because starting June 1st like I only have my skincare Suite Tuesdays and Fridays so I really can't leave to come do a park and rec board meet so Thursdays would be the preference if that's okay so Thursday if we skip June what about Thursday the 13th we'll have it a little sooner in the month Deborah are you here Thursday the 13th evening the week when you leave June or July July hour during July okay yeah so you leave the Fourth of July I come back on the 8th okay so how about July 13 Sean perfect at two o'clock okay yeah why don't we just plan on that then and we don't do we skip the June meeting I'll miss you so much I'll see you Beach cleanup so we're skipping yeah we're skipping June well could we do like if anything comes up like we'll be notified by email or something yeah okay yeah yeah if anything comes up because right now like looking at this and just basically because we don't have a whole lot on our calendar other than Beach cleanup which we all know about none of this stuff is really you know I mean like we're not really planning anything um and that'll give Aaron more time to cross things off his list yes I got you yes I'm on this I know it's exciting I guess well you know it really isn't me it's it is Justin and Grady who they're the ones to think on that so yes they are they and it's it's not as easy as work as it seems you know um yeah I can't say enough about it so yeah yeah and until that's like you thought about that too because that'll change I mean we've always had a like our biggest for anything that either the Community Foundation or the park and rec board or anything in the city going on it's always the hardest thing to get the word out and so like a big banner across would be obviously it's much more eye-catching than from the buildings so we'd be spending the same amount of money but it would have a bigger impact same amount of money as well the banner across the front of the building you think that would be loud enough I mean I don't know does that banner across the front was only about yeah yeah that wouldn't it's not long you would miss that now as long as you want and as wide as you want um just you know when it when they cost you all banners it's based off a square foot yeah it doesn't matter how much teeth you want or it's a square footage of meal yeah I don't know what I would just get one where you could change out the dates with number by vinyl numbering saying you know and that way you're not having to buy a new Banner every time oh yeah right um and it's very easy to do so you you spend three dollars to have someone cut out some ice vinyl numbers put them on here hang it up done deal for the date for the change absolutely for these things that we do over and over absolutely yeah we kind of did that on a smaller scale for all of our tables like we have a merchandise table we have a community table we have so we've done that on a smaller scale and yeah it works great there's no dates so yeah um the minutes let's make that change and get them signed he said we can just do you have any yeah yeah okay so I gave you yours uh they had a little thing for signatures yeah see where did mine go oh I must have put it away I think you did because I used to post it okay Cami just to verify we're not having to be nope okay and then we're making the one change to last month's minutes and then um I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn your perking individual is no longer there oh they left the placement they made or they were already gone that based on I was just he'd said that he didn't see anybody fishing and he gets any Vehicles gave us a left okay good morning maybe there were no fish biting data proved is 523 of course 23 okay missed him sign up to my notes for the agreement are you a doctor you didn't eat it I don't know magazine and get my husband's signatures right on the coffee table oh my God she's famous that's what I said I meant to bring it so she would autograph it her magazine it's just like my kindergarten signature I didn't know that Union hasn't hadn't known each other since kitten I said I gave them our class picture and they didn't put it in there that's crazy that they didn't do that because you said you didn't believe me you could probably have to sign it again I like yours okay um that we are meeting I second it all in favor is a jury"
