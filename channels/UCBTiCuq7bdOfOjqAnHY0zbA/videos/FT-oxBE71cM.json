motion shall know motion by mark beam the second second second by david gaddis any discussion citizens any questions are on the agenda rickshaw good evening rickshaw 115 13th street bellow beach

has a right to do whatever they want to do in that area but i just like to put out that in the future if something like that is going to be done something as important as recognizing our law enforcement it might be not a bad idea or it might be a good idea to put something out to the citizens so that some of us could have the opportunity to come here and say thank you to our law officers

world council member beam council member gattis council member shirley aye council member swope councilmember aki aye vice mayor gunn mayor manzo all right so it passes seven to zero the consent agenda is approved we move to our regular agenda item number eight consideration of ordinance 21-01 an ordinance of the city council of the city of dela beach florida providing for the amendment of chapter 2 boards committees and commissions of the city code ordinances relating to the creation of an administration advisory committee providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the amendment of chapter 2 boards committees and commissions of the city code of ordinances relating to the creation of an administration advisory committee providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for several ability providing for the repeal of ordinances in conflict here with and providing for an effective date the description is ordinance to develop a standing advisory committee for the continuity for the continuity for continuity and expected expediency to have motion i do have a one suggestion and i'll pitch that before i see if there's any consensus before i ask for an amendment and that would be rather than call it a administrative committee call it a citizens advisory committee i think that just speaks to communications not only to the residents but from the residents it gives them a a formal engagement in city affairs so i don't know if there's any acting for that sort of thing if there is i'll go ahead and ask for the advantage it makes sense i think that's what you've been talking about all along for the last you know two or three times this has been introduced so yeah i don't i don't have an issue about anybody else but i'm getting it so so i didn't give me a thumbs up instead that we call it the citizens advisory committee beach and we have a second on that second seconds by the slope um so our discussion on just the changed name change any discussion on that no discussion citizens just on the name change anybody have any comments on the name change only come back to you uh glenn gunn last word on that and then i'm going to take the boat to make just the name change and then we'll build the whole thing i'm ready to call it a question okay so the amendment before us is to change the name from the administration advisory committee any place that appears in here i'm not going to read it all i'll try and do it on the first pass but that would be changed to citizen advisory committee a yes vote will approve that name change only that'll clerk on the amendment only council member aki aye council member swope council member shirley aye councilmember gattis aye councilmember beam aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo hi so the amendment passes it's now going to be called the citizen advisory committee we're back down to the discussion that we initially had which is the formation of this committee and the consideration of ordinance 21-0 one when you started this you kind of started with the amendment so i'll come back to you if you have any thoughts to complete before we move on nothing further i think it's pretty much else i i do agree i think this is a good committee i think it will save us a lot of time um my only question is just in the administration of this committee and it really comes down to how the um the city collects the information it's a very important committee and it asks for people to be very well-rounded i think our present application that we use it has nothing to do with this ordinance but how that's how we're going to enact this organs it doesn't really provide it says attach a cv or resume if you want i really think on this committee we need to see what the background is we're asking for people to be very well-rounded have a great background and i think it would be nice to know what people's background is because sometimes we get kind of generic responses up into some of the replies that we get it would really be nice to know what people's business and their city background is so it doesn't change this i think it just maybe puts a spot that it's kind of mandatory to give us your background something more you know it's like a job application that was just my own thoughts on it okay and i agree with that it's a very important uh aspect of these the city and its input so maybe uh we put a little more uh specificity to the vetting process and have them appear in person when in few words and give us an idea and ask answer questions i think that's excellent also and i also want to personally thank you i had my reservations about this was that it was a three-year committee and i see that that was changed two years it's corresponding with all our other committees and totally behind us anyone else on council i'll move to the citizens there are no citizen comments back to you glenn gunn for the last word before i call it oh i would just speak to your fellow neighbors and we've had some great inputs from the residents before so if you're in attendance tonight and you have any interest please step forward and let the city clerk or the city manager know we certainly appreciate all the help and input we can get thank you thank you that's great okay so i'm gonna pull the question item number eight consideration i'm gonna try and mine if i miss it you just feel free to cut right in here i'm gonna try and put citizen advisor committee in so consideration ordinance 21-0-1 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida providing for the amendment of chapter two boards committees and commissions of the city code of ordinances relating to the creation of a citizen advisory committee providing for incorporation of recitals providing for the amendment of chapter two boards committees and commissions of the city code of ordinances related to the creation of a citizens advisory committee providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for several ability dividing for the repeal of all ordinances and conflict here with and providing for an effective date um and i should point out that this is the first reading we'll need a second reading of this if it passes tonight so this is first reading so everyone knows team foreign we'll bring this to that second vote and move it forward council member beam all right council member gattis council member shirley aye council member swope aye council member aki aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo hi so it's unanimous seven to zero passes it'll be on our next agenda um for the second reading if it passes then it becomes ordinance that has changed um madam clerk can you please for the next um reading make that change that we had with the uh with the citizen advisor committee that's the only change that was approved yes thank you okay item number nine is consideration of resolution okay okay it's resolution 202101 a resolution of the city of bellar beach florida mending and restating resolution 2020-09 in its entirety authorizing the issuance of a stormwater utility system recommended series 2021 in the principal amount of not to exceed 45 000 to fund the acquisition and installation of capital improvements necessary for the provision of stormwater management services in the city providing that the series 2021 node shall be a limited obligation of the city payable from certain stormwater fees as provided herein providing for the rights and remedies of the owner of the series 2021 note making certain covenants and agreements in connection there with and providing for an effective date description on this is it authorizes the issuance of a storm order utility revenue note not to exceed 45 000 do i have a motion yeah i think we've discussed this pretty thoroughly before so i'm ready to go ahead and make anybody else have any discussion to move it forward counsel one question for the city attorney you've read this through you're satisfied with it from a legal perspective yes sir okay can we go to council comments citizen comments back to council ending with rita's law for the question this is item number now but what one other point uh this is supposed to remind me when lynn told me that tonight we got a blue line copy placed on our desks here um section nine was amended by the instruction of the bank correct yes okay and then uh chris rose sent this amendment so the one we will sign uh it's page eight basically it's just changing some wording yes yeah so so the change is it says in settling the rate of the stormwater fee for each fiscal year the city shall ensure that the net revenues to be collected shall be equal or to or equal to or exceed 1.25 times the annual interest and principal payments coming due on the series 2021 note in such fiscal year does that change anybody's ideas on this anybody want to say anything on council i would just ask for the uh for the benefit of the people who are in attendance tonight if the city manager could just take 30 seconds and recap what this is for just so that everybody in the audience understands validation that we did earlier in the spring we went to court to get validated and this is one of the requirements of the bond it's a three-year loan the interest rate is 3.75 and as we already stated it won't exceed 45 000. what we're going to utilize it for is to buy the uh check valves for the rest of the streets down and get a head start on up to 18th street to get a head start on putting those check valves in before we get to the point where we work on their stroke on our system in the validation process that's kind of like a pseudo we bring suit against ourselves to make a legal determination of how strong this stored water pump is right thank you lynn i had one follow-up question to that this puts an obligation to us that our net revenues to be collected um shall be equal or exceed 1.25 times the interest rate i i know this person i don't think that's any issue but i just want to hear from you that that's not going to be an issue with the collection i think our estimated collections are like 170 000 years so it's that's this was well over 100 okay [Music] i'm going to go back to the citizens in case there's any comments because i just added that piece is there anything from the citizens back to council let's call this so item number nine is consideration of resolution 2021-01 resolution of the city of bellar beach florida amending and restating resolution 2020.09 in its entirety authorizing the issuance of the stormwater utility system revenue node series 2021 in the principle of not to exceed 45 000 to fund the acquisition and installation of capital improvements necessary for the provision of stormwater management services in the city providing that the series 2021 note shall be a limited obligation of the city payable from certain stormwater fees as provided here providing for the rights and remedies of the owner of the series 2021 note making certain covenants and agreements in connection there with and providing for an effective date a yes vote passes this there is no second reading madam clerk council member gattis council member shirley aye council member swope council member aki aye council member bean aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo aye passes seven to zero this is approved um city manager you'll move forward with this then okay i see the sheriff has arrived you're ready to keep that report okay welcome come on new year to everyone i'm sorry for my target situation another city had to go take care of real quick first but uh um uh we had a uh good ending to the year we had no other major calls month of december for what i could see some next monthly reports be uh uh about like our normal report um for november 2020 we had um um we did have uh one uh larceny this month um i can see that uh um we did one arrest on a felony possession of charles substance uh one for possession drug paraphernalia and a dui that's only uh there's only two people total arrested for the month of november for um our regular uh monthly activity in the city most of it was self-initiated once again mostly house checks direction patrols we did have uh shows uh 93 traffic stops uh this past month and uh there's only two crashes with and we had 124 citations and warnings issued in the month of november so hope everyone had a good uh new year dave any questions reference monthly report sure i did um and maybe it's just a typo replaced in the wrong line but we have a felony uh in november 2020 it says forcible sex offense and you didn't mention that so i just wanted that's that's i i just i just went back to page one oh i was looking the wrong month on that yeah i uh i will get some information on that for you uh uh let me it in the back of the room i i did not see that report prior to now so i will look that up for you and i'll get you information as soon as i can that's out of character for our city so if you give us some information if we don't if you don't have it you know immediately you can just get it now um i will uh get that for you before the end of this meeting okay that will be wonderful just signal to me when you're ready if you have any if you want to speak well thank you um any counsel comments or questions uh citizens any questions for the sheriff it's great to hear that december was a good month so yeah let's just find out i think i saw very few offenses put on december so i think we're gonna look good next month so let me go look this up for you i'll let you know what i find i appreciate it thank you very much okay we're back to the regular agenda we're now on item 10. this is the consideration of creating a city of bellar beach policy to specifically address remote attendance as well as a forum physical presence for the rapidly changing manner of conducting business electronically the description says develop a concept for remote attendance by city council and the residents in alignment with the florida's government in the sunshine law and budgeting acquisition and implementation of the necessary equipment so first i have a motion the smoke makes the motion i think that was marv or was it dave uh yeah i first would like to ask who put this on the agenda that was me and i'll go ahead and defer to you vice verde thank you uh if you if everyone will dig through their stack of uh enclosures in front of them on friday with just some slides on it i put together some notes and thoughts for everyone i just want to make sure that jody can hear me on the phone sometimes i know being on the other end there it's kind of tough here yeah it's very difficult but yeah okay i'll do my best here so i'm looking at the the slides there's two slides on each page i'm sure i'm not sure there's enough for the audience or if there's any out there but in essence what i'm trying to do is just bring the city policy into alignment with what we've been basically doing doing during all the emergencies and as i started doing some research on this thing what i find is a lot of other municipalities have been had standing policies in effect since the uh the uh 2010 2014 time frame so what we've been doing isn't isn't far from uh what the norm is on this thing but along with everything else that i've always been preaching is i would like to institutionalize this policy i would like to have it in writing so that everybody can refer to it and know exactly what the foundation is and the principles from which we operate so let me just run through this very quickly that the goal of this whole thing is basically to develop a concise common sense written policy that outlines attendance including that electronic at public meetings for the elected officials as well as their residents if you go through the second page there the third slide the policy should and what i've done is it can't excuse me let me just interpret for a second plenty of information i don't have that document thank you continue okay so to just encapsulate some of the things we're trying to capture with this uh we all lead very busy complex lifestyles and this really uh dovetails very nicely with just just the way we work and live today as well as how we conduct business so in essence this policy should number one enable the effective and efficient conduct of city business we definitely need to align with the scope and intent of all the florida statutes the bellaire beach charter and code requirements and of course our strategic plan we we hope to foster participation by elected officials and residents and when i say residents it's not only to attend these meetings but prior to this we have been a little tight on attendance requirements so that precluded busy working people who had busy traveling scheduled from participating in municipal government and hopefully this will maybe bring some of those people into the poll the policy needs to engender a sense of community promote two-way communication the discussion feedback and the positive exchange of ideas and of course as we found out during this whole covert thing augment safety and the flexibility in case of emergencies so far as the background goes we need to go out i've done a cursory benchmarking of some other municipalities and i've actually enclosed a resolution there from illinois and it dates back to 2014 so this is nothing new people have been doing this for a long time and as i address some of the things we need to include in this and you'll you can see right in that resolution that it hits on most of those topics and we can probably use a lot of the other municipalities as a boilerplate for what we want to do and really kind of speed up this process in the previous uh background information that was sent out there was a white paper by this uh robert eschenfelder and again it goes back to 2010 and he discusses the modern sunshine laws in florida and how attending public meetings electronically is basically consistent with all the sunshine requirements imposed by the florida statute in the white paper he did talk about a quorum and his recommendation is to leave it unless we find that the florida statutes have changed since 2010 but to go ahead and leave those as an in-person requirement so that in other words a meeting is not considered a meeting and not able to transact business that's binding on the city unless you had a quorum in person at the meeting place sunshine requirements just a quick overview meeting held at an accessible public place where public officials may hear each other and all other speakers and in quasi-judicial matters public officials and the parties can see exhibits and other evidence obviously these are all things we're going to strive for if we meet electronically we would like to be able to not only see and hear all the other elected officials but the residents need to be able to see and hear us and if they want to speak and engage the city council then they need to be able to do that and we also need a format so that we can present documents and that sort of thing for everyone to view so far as the next steps go draft review edit and an active written policy that addresses the use of electronic technology for these purposes i uh i took an educated guess three months and i think that's just the the most exorbitant uh time frame i think if we can find a good benchmark and use their boilerplate we can speed up this process very quickly we want to be able to cover such things as attendance quorum voting procedures and resident participation and lastly outfit the council chambers with the appropriate technology to allow an interaction in-person attendance as well as a remote electronic attendance city manager and staff has already started that he's got a big screen ready to go in the back but i think we need to just kind of sit down and conceptualize how best to do this we want to be able to see each other even if we're sitting up here if we're sitting at home citizens should be able to see us and speak and then we need to figure out how we're going to work the process who's going to actually staff this thing and control the inputs from the citizens and that sort of thing i broke it down conceptualizing determining the procedures budgeting doing the initial acquisition and staffing and training the personnel i come up with an outside figure of 10 months i think we can easily shave it down so we're probably talking anywhere from nine months to a year a little we're more than that that sort of approach could obviously be phased in i mean tonight we've got uh shirley calling in our diamond and so i mean we can start wrapping this thing up and just understand how how where we are now and where we want to go and how we're going to get there so that pretty much covers all of that there is one baseline thing left and that's in the actual section 2-59 of our charter that talks about the essence of a plural the first section addresses the makeup and the purpose of a quorum and then the last portion of it talks about and i i can read that verbatim in the absence of a quorum that mayor shall have the assistance of other council members present compel the attendance of the absent council members which shall delay meeting for no longer than 30 minutes now to me that's kind of a loose end of this thing we've had uh numerous discussions with this thing and there seems to be perhaps some disagreement in how that's to be interpreted or what that actually means so i would like to take the time and a couple minutes of discussion here to figure out what everybody's thoughts are on that as i read through that it's a multi-part kind of requirement there that the first part is it's at the insistence of other council members present it's not a unilateral decision of any member present to decide what the action is that's going to be taken the second part that is kind of nebulous to me is this word compel i'm not quite sure what that means and i think we need to perhaps open up the discussion to figure out what that's supposed to mean and then the third part of it is uh basically it's not to be delayed for any longer than 30 minutes so at this point i can open it up for discussion i'll take it back um so back to council comments i'm gonna jump in here i stick with the idea of the um of the remote meetings i think other cities are doing it other groups that are on other boards are doing it a couple ideas some places some of the boards that might will mandate a certain number of in-person meetings and the rest can be virtual okay we ran the city for six months on virtual meetings and you know it started off rocky because nobody knew what was coming and we ramped up and by the end i think we're doing very well with it um so it does work i don't think that there's anything that compels right now i think the idea and i look through this with the charter in our ordinances i think the idea right now is that we'd be here in person but i don't think that's a requirement that we're stuck with we can change that and based on that um law article that you sent out they said basically that the attorney general apparently is all over the place on their interpretation of it but they said that you know basically a quorum doesn't necessarily have to be in person it can be a meeting of members so i think we can look at this because it doesn't have to necessarily be in person it doesn't have to be in person every single time the technology we have at least the scouting of right now and we can probably expand that better there was something in this article that i thought was very good you know a lot of us are technology we like it there's other people who don't own a computer or a smartphone um we have to if we're going to do this have an ability to have somebody here and there usually is somebody at headquarters where you can come in and there is a computer available to you if you don't know so this gives the citizens the opportunity to come in but i think we could even think outside the box and think to maybe making a certain number of these things virtual we get 10 000 cases a day of coping right now i hope to god it's cured in a few months but i was just talking city manager you can't even get an appointment to get a shot right now so it may not be cured as quickly as we hoped for it so we could think about this long term and there's no reason we can't change this um in terms of timeline the only other comment i have is that the ordinance the i think we have to change ordinances so you're looking at two readings on that but we the the nucleus of this is a good idea i think we can flesh it out as a concept of it to the detail on it so as for 2-59 i'll tell you what paul mourinho told me a former attorney he said basically if the city council is sitting home you could compel their attendance which isn't totally correct because it says somebody else has they have to be brought by the people that are here compel their attendance and basically actually have them brought to the meetings i think that's a very severe thing but at the same token business has to be done people can't bolt up meetings so i would hope you never have to use something like that i don't care if we take it out or not but if you get a counselor that decides to stay home there are new rules you have four absences before you're off council so it could be months that this city is deadlocked so that's my only tournament okay i'll take uh i'll take those in the order you presented them number one is that yeah i think if you go back and you read that let's go back and let's get all the council comments and then they'll come back to you on the second go right actually goes back to read and then works its way back down anyone else that's sure um facing uh the problems that the country is going through right now i think overall we've done pretty well to adapt whenever we're all out of the building we also seem to do very well whenever we're all in the building the the one uh problem we have is the mixed uh setting where you have some people here and some people on the phone and you're always gonna have people that are at home that that would uh prefer not to come in but are interested in in our meetings so in a nutshell the piece that's missing really is is something to support some type of multimedia device here which we've discussed a little in the past it wasn't it wasn't the correct solution for us and i'm not really sure what is the correct solution but as far as this understanding of uh the compelling council members to attend i i'm not sure if we've really had this has been a major issue for us it barely came up it came up almost once so hopefully it'll never come so you know i'm a little i guess i'm trying to figure out where this actually came from why this was included uh in this presentation but beyond that i am all for uh this uh moving into a solution uh for for our future because uh like you say cases are ramping up even if they slow down i don't think we're going back to what we used to know for anytime soon so i'm all for it well i agree with what dave the thing we have to do is get the technology in place so that like the situation we have tonight with council going surely on the phone it'd be nice to see her on video and back and forth and again with any call-in call-ins that we have the same the same way i think it can be done we'll just have to put some money and budget for them that have been very important robin sportoni everybody said what i was thinking paddy does joey have any comments patty can i say something yes go ahead is it tai can right now yes yes the mayor recognized you yes okay okay so there is a perfect example of why we need to do this because i could i think that marv was had mentioned me and i heard about every other word i did not even hear the mayor okay hold on jody and they can't hear you either so could you speak a little louder oh gosh i'm talking right into the phone okay yeah wait here we go oh there we go thank you that was already my fault okay so what i was saying was i said that uh you know just to the point of the sub spirit i heard marv speaking but only heard very faintly did not even hear me or recognize me so it's very difficult when you call in i mean and and quite honestly i'm sure that lyndon surely do why i'm out but the reason i'm out is because i think i might have been exposed to coping and i didn't make the test come back from the people who think they might have it i didn't want to expose anyone else so i decided it was best to stay home um you know this is we all have life outside of being council members and so therefore i think it's kind of important to have some flexibility plus i think it's really important to have resident participation and i think you'll have more regular participation if we have some multimedia um communication available rather than this call-in which is very very very difficult you know so glenn thank you for bringing this to the council i appreciate it that's it jody thank you and i wish you the best i hope and pray that everything will work out okay for you and i'm sure we all do thank you we're gonna go around second round and i think glenn i know you wanted to speak so go ahead well i'd like to speak as well great as well go ahead uh vice mayor glendon i'd like to say this is a very good presentation um i do think it's very important to get remote and accessibility to our citizens that can't make it in i agree with the timeline and all of that and the purpose of it and i do think we need to look at equipment see what we do need to get as far as the quorum thing um that did obviously come to a head in the days last work session meeting i don't think anybody should be able to compel any member to come back in because actually it would be a violation of the sunshine rule in my opinion for the mayor to ask any remaining council members here if there isn't a quorum here because you're not supposed to have any conversation so um as far as compelled the attendance i i'd like to see that room just taken totally out that's just given somebody extra authority to threaten basically to have other people arrested i mean vice mayor clinton you were threatened to be arrested on december 7th which is a very important day in our history for our military you are obviously served in the military and thank you for that but to arrest the vice mayor of this city on december 7th was absolutely difficult to even listen to that so that's my opinion on this nice to meet you i'll take them in some of the order i i agree with the idea that in-person meetings are important but i think we need to have that flexibility and maybe when we construct this thing we come up with some reasonable schedule maybe once a quarter once a semi-annual period you have a requirement for a full council meeting in person that's to be decided i guess i think if you go back and you look at the law article and it's going to be up to the city attorney to probably research and find out what the latest attorney and attorney general opinion is on this so far but the felon who wrote that white paper suggested you leave quorum in person to avoid any conflict if at a future date florida decides to stay with a in-person quorum because that would mean that if you had any meetings prior to that it might invalidate any actions taken by the city where you did not have an in-person forum so that was merely his suggestion if you go back and you look through that white paper and i think if we can't find any changes then that may be a good good thing to think about is just stay within personal core longer this this idea of compel i i agree with what rita said and maybe it slipped some memories but there was a very strong arm statement made at a previous council meeting where there was a well if if if you decide to leave the meeting i'm going to compel the sheriff to bring you back well i'm not quite sure first of all as i said the the whole discussion about compelling is multi-part and it's not a unilateral decision made by the mayor it's made at the insistence of the remaining council members there so it's not a unilateral decision that's made secondly i would like to know what compelled means city attorney i'll ask you hang on hang on make your point we'll ask you if you could ask the question but you're speaking right now and i've made my point so i don't believe that that word compelled means that you you ask not even ask i think they the frame of reference at that point on december 7th was i'm going to direct the sheriff to bring you back if you leave this meeting and i do not believe that's to be a proper interpretation of compel i mean in my mind means we can get ask the city clerk or the city manager to call a council member to please return and like part three of uh 2-59 suggests if that can't be done within 30 minutes that's the end of the meeting so i would at this point ask the city manager what's his interpretation of compel and then i'm going to follow that up with the city attorney and then we can even ask the uh the supervisor in the sheriff's detail here what that we'll go through the council first and then we'll come back to their questions later please note those questions i'm going to speak about what was said because it's information that's incorrect and remind everyone of what exactly happened on december 7th and you can go back and look at the tape um and i've got robin next um we've had four people here we were having a work session discussion um two individuals one individual was speaking a citizen i called a point of order i was interrupted by the vice mayor that's against our rules told me to let them speak or i will leave then you will not get a corner i wouldn't say anything and then he said what are you going to do arrest me he stood up held his hands out and said he said what are you going to do with me i said go ahead and do it and watch what happens i'm going by what our former city attorney told me okay and the information is there now he sat down and he concluded the meeting but if people are going to act up and break quorum and disrupt this meeting then we will do whatever is on the ordinance whether you like the ordinance or not it's still our ordinance if you don't like it we remove the ordinance there's a procedure for that too as for whether we i don't i thought we were going to talk about meeting remote we did not talk about existing ordinances because that really isn't in here but since we're getting way off topic um if we're going to talk about compelling attendance i already explained but i think the reason was i didn't pass that rule that was passed with a prior counsel many many years ago and it's so that you can't have people sitting home yeah two members of this council walk out that night prior to the meeting we had one member walk out in the middle of the meeting we can't do business if everybody's going to go home ask for in-person versus not in person the florida attorney general's opinions are all over the place and fred we can i i think it's unfair to place this on you to be the supreme court and figure out what they're trying to say i know they're advisory only but there's plenty of organizations in florida that are meeting without quorum right without in-person quora and this article said that we aren't going to do it it is not fair particularly in the middle of a pandemic that certain people have to come here and other people can take days weeks months away from the city and just choose to sit home i mean hey i like sitting home i can sit there in my slippers and pick up these meetings i don't have to get in a suit and tie it's really nice it kind of puts it a little bit more difficult for those who do come here i do agree we should have at least one meeting per quarter maybe one meeting per half in front of the citizens no matter what um but after that there's no reason this stuff can't be done remotely and if we have to get the attorney general to weigh in on it i think it's just a matter of us changing our ordinance anyway that's what happened if you want to change 2-59 there's an easy procedure for doing that take it away and then if people want to sit home then they'll sit home and we just won't conduct the business after four meetings that you miss then you're on council it's that simple um no i was just going to kind of you kind of did a little bit to clarify and dave said you know i'm not sure why this slide was on and i was thinking in my head it was on because of that meeting um the drama and i just wanted i wanted to point out that it's it's not a one-sided it was definitely heated on both sides and the only reason why it concluded was because i had to start yelling in the microphone and practically stand up and get in front of two boys pretty much it felt like misbehaving so i think that the issue why this was put on was probably more of a personal thing than anything else i to me compel can be whatever it needs to be would you please return back to this meeting or we really need to vote on this we need a quorum hey can you just go pick them up and bring them in real quick with sirens blazing so he gets here faster i think again when i talked about the last me i'm not a lawyer but it seems like every word you can interpret it interpret it any which way and also i don't think this needs to come out but what i do think that it never needs to be done it never needs to be used and i think that comes back to what fred was saying about reasonable people reasonable conclusions all act like adults stop getting tempers involved stop getting hurt feelings and stop bringing drama from past meetings back again that's what this slide is about past drama winery live it and quite frankly with these meetings i am so sick of the drama this is a tiny city our issues aren't nearly as huge as other big cities i do not understand why we can't all get along that's fine other council members on the second test third pass council i think we have a problem with equating attendance to participation and that is not that is not true you can sit at home in your pajamas and participate in a council meeting okay so that basically goes to the argument of well they're not here they're not participating in city government and again you we have already enacted charter amendments to what happens when you're not participating in those council meetings so that's that's a movement i do believe that uh business should be conducted generally without threats and that that should be how we conduct business and when when you subtract that out of the equation then things do get heated and tempers flare and passions override critical thinking and discussion so i again once again i want to make sure we all have a common baseline of what this compel is i think i think there's no reason we need to go through the imaginations of changing that i just think we need to understand what that means and i don't believe that it's i can twist your arm and compel you and bring you back here forcefully to a meeting no that's not the general way we do business here and that's not the collegial way this this body should operate so i just want to make sure that that's that's a common baseline and i'll defer to the city manager and the city attorney to see if i'm interpreting that wrong or if i'm just completely off the track so i'm still i'm still with council i'm going to go over to you but we've done three passes so i'm going to go back to city council to the city uh officials um attendance first participation one point that's the only and enough plan i'm gonna make you can sit here and other than voting you're not compelled to do anything other than not disrupt a meeting no one has to say a word you may not like the topic you just sit here you can doodle subject to public disclosure but you can sit and draw a sketch but as long as you sit here okay when you go home and that was not a televised meeting okay then you're not in attendance any longer and then we no longer have a car so i have no problem where a person is joking shirley is on the telephone right now she is completely participating in this meeting to the extent she wishes to that's fine she doesn't have to say a word as long as she votes that's it so that's attendance first participation i don't think it matters where you are really doesn't and uh i i second with what robin said by the good comments counsel anything else i'm gonna go to the city uh attorney and city manager if you don't have any other council comments it doesn't matter the order to me city attorney manager well i have a whole list of things okay um the the principal thing is state law which is the sunshine law and that that has the requirement that uh the meetings be in public and the criteria that vice mayor gunn uh delineated in his presentation um there of course is for a violation of that there's a penalty and the penalty is a personal penalty to the seven of you who are the elected officials if you don't comply with the state law so to me that's that's the starting point the several people vice mayor gunn and mayor manzo have said the the same things that i have assessment i made reading the the article that was the first time i'd ever seen an article that had all of those up to that point listed i had uh at one point or another read many of those attorney general opinions and the reality is they are indeed all over the place and the it's you know most um folks i hope realize an attorney general opinion is an opinion it doesn't have any binding authority to it it's basically a the current city or excuse me current attorney general's of view of the law at that that point in time the ones that count or the case law and the the case law i would suspect is is also all over the place um i i want to point something out to me that's very significant about 2020 you had to adapt during the pandemic and the reason that you were able to do the remote meetings is because primarily the governor issued a series of executive orders that gave flexibility to the the cities and counties to have meetings so that we could get through the covenant period i as far as i'm concerned when the executive orders expired we returned back to the previous um regulatory scheme or statutory scheme which was having the meetings in person so as much as you may want to revert to that period of time i would say absent executive orders or absent statutory changes i don't know that you're going to be able to do that um i'm going to take a contrarian's view of all i've heard and i i want uh especially vice mayor gunn to know this i i read all the the material you provided and i i pondered it quite a bit over the last you know two weeks or so that i've i've had to ponder it um it's not the only thing i thought of though thankfully had other things to think about as well but the contrarian's opinion is if you want the law there to be a change then my suggestion to you is you advocate the legislature to make a a clarification that the basically is the argument that the the law should catch up with the technology and i i think i said before to this council there's always a lag between the technology and and the law or excuse me the other way around there's always a lag between the law and technology and technology is always in a race to catch up it never catches up because technology just moves too fast but i don't know the last time that the the sunshine law related to public meetings was was uh revamped but i would say it's been long enough ago that a lot of the technology capabilities were simply not taken into account and the one good thing out of coke but if there was ever any was that you know people learned to work in a different manner including this council and other cities and counties all over the state of florida but my suggestion to you is i don't know that i'm that enthusiastic about creating a policy although if that's what you want to do i certainly will you know be up for the task my hard suggestion to you is to lobby the legislature to change the law so that it it's a state-wide-wide issue this is not the only city that's grappling with this type of thing and i i think the the beauty in getting the law changed is it takes you out of the the potential for um somebody asserting that you're violating the law i'm i'm very much uh oriented towards safe harbors in the same harbor that you you have when all seven of you are here is there's simply no issue but that with seven of you present there is a forum and there's full debate and discussion of every issue when you start to have one or more or three people be absent i think you get you know further away from the same program and i i personally would always encourage my clients to pursue the same hope you know and limit the number of times you're going to venture far from it the the last thing i will say is on the compel issue that's what vice mayor gunn recited what's in the city's code that's a provision that you can change if you want to because it's in the code and i i will make the observation uh compel isn't defined and the code provision does not delineate the manner of the compulsion so when determined in legal evaluation when you the term is not defined then the general principle that is applied is that you use the generally general meaning that that word has compelled could mean a number of things i've heard compel means the sheriff goes and does something the city manager makes a phone call the city clerk makes a phone call all of those could be a manner of compulsion but i will tell you and i don't mean to speak for the sheriff i don't speak for the sheriff they they have their own legal counsel they're constitutional officers but there's always going to be in my mind a separation of powers issue between us or the in in this case the presiding officer directing the sheriff to do something i think you will get pushback from the sheriffs on that because they have to be independent if somebody's standing here that is completely unruly and completely disruptive and have disregarded every reasonable request for them to conduct themselves in a manner that uh befits the quorum of this type of a meeting then i think there would come a point where the sheriff would say the person is being uh disruptive and they would do something but i think there's uh you you get into a potentially a difficult situation for them if you try to direct them to do certain things that's my view and some point i may have to talk to their counsel about that if it is an issue i'll conclude my comments with with a in a way a question and my question is it it has this been such a problem up till now that you really need to do something create a policy to address a problem during the time that i've been here you've never canceled a meeting due to a lack of a quorum and you i think have always and then can speak better to this and i but the times where there have been people away on vacation or sick you've had them the council members communicating with either patty lynn or both and you've you know worked things out so that you you didn't have a meeting where a lot of people came here and you simply couldn't go hold the meeting so i'm asking the question is is it really that big of a problem that you need to do something different and if it is and it's a concern that is a concern for the future i'm i'm all for being uh aware and planning for the you know how to do things better in the future and i i think i applaud mayor or vice mayor dunn that that's absolutely an issue you should be constantly considering but i again will end with is this really that big of a an issue city management do you want to add anything my my thing with this zoom or whatever you want to call it i think we found out a lot of things over the past few months and i had talked to our i.t guy about what would i need to do because i think we gained a lot of public input when we were on those new meetings and i think that is an important faucet that we need to go forward and move forward to do something in here that we can do that the console's going to go to ipads here probably in the next few months because that's part of the budget process and i think the opportunity if there's a way for the public to see you visually and they're at home and they want to call in and talk to the meeting because they don't you know they can't get here or for whatever reason if there's something that's important i think it's important that they have that opportunity and i really thought that we got a lot of people a lot more people than what we got here tonight uh 10 people okay roughly we had more than 10 people on the zoo calls so what that tells me is we need to move forward and try to create something and how we do that is i think what the vice mayor is kind of proposing is to figure out what's the best way to communicate to the citizens and what's the best way for the citizens to communicate to you and you know if you're out of town as an example like in jody's case tonight we need to have that opportunity to make sure that she's heard possibilities she's visible if if it's attainable uh i think those are the things that going forward that council needs to to try to get in what i'll call the uh electronic age and i'm not in the electronic age well i guess i am sort of i i don't have a flip phone you still have a foot phone well well i have my personal information i have a lot of you know i use the ipad regularly and things like that i have a flip phone because that's what the city provides but i think this is a step forward and and i don't know what you know i kind of heard that from the rest of the council that this this is a constant step forward and how we create the policy as far as the quorum and the issue i read that article actually twice and the guy there there's differing opinions on many many things in that article they were all over the place and so i think going forward we need to look at this in some way and the first policy may not be all encumbering but it's it's got to be started at this point i think uh one second jody let me just get when finished and then i'll come over to you uh as far as the compel i i have to go along with this compels a word uh i think that the comment that it says that the assistance of the other council members present i don't think any of us would want and i would say from the statutory office of the sheriff i don't think i could i don't think any council member could i don't think the mayor could direct them to go get somebody from their house i just don't think that and i've had a couple conversations with them and that's pretty much where they're at with it uh so the definition of compel maybe we need to put something in the artist what does compel me but that could be what needs to be done and it needs to be clear if this is going to be an issue that's that's my opinion joey shirley yeah i just did um chime in a little bit of what lynn was saying you know this is the first time i've ever called it it it is extremely difficult to participate from this end um i don't see the um electronic communication being a replacement for our live meetings and you know maybe that's near when we look into this further we address that in the case where probably because people are still in business still living life you know don't forget this is a non-compensating position um so you know it's not as though in my opinion it's volunteer right we're not although we are elected officials we are still a volunteer position and that we're giving our hours and our time to the city and to the residents of bel air beach and so there isn't time you can't take a meeting i find um the fact that we can't call in and participate third i just find it unbelievable that we haven't even gotten the technology to provide services for a council member let alone in a residence who wants to participate so i think it's really important but again i don't see that as a replacement for in-person meetings or have i'm still the requirement form and i feel like they still needed that still need to be priority but this would be a uh situation in my climate or someone's traveling or you know called away or you know what have you they still have to be creative participate thank you um city attorney after hearing your comments i think i have to our protection always comes when we're siding with what our city attorney tells us is an interpretation of the law so if you're feeling that you know there really isn't the option at this point in time for the city council members to routinely participate you know and calling a quorum outside of the building then to me it's a non-starter that's to me i don't know what everybody else feels but i would not vote for something like that um however um i you know i i think when it comes to the citizens there's no such prohibition so to the extent that we could and i agree with what he said we counted 10 people here tonight such a decent attendance everybody here is at risk and i applaud everybody for coming out tonight but you know you're putting yourself at risk of clothing to come to a council meeting wouldn't it be nice if you could be watching this on tv um victor invited me one time to take a look at indian rocks the technology is there we did it in the middle of the summer i was watching their meeting um from my uh bedroom okay i never have to have to leave the bedroom i was i don't think i was able to participate i think he got that later on but um you're able to do it if you want so no reason citizens can't do it even if we can't um i am concerned uh and i don't ascribe any nefarious motives or anything to this but there is some concern about people who might be on council who might be not here for extended periods of time clearly what councilwoman shirley is going through tonight is exactly what is envisioned by the attorney general's opinions there's a documented medical reason and thank god you know hopefully she'll be okay but don't come in okay you know that's a good situation but um you know if you're away for a week a month a year that's a whole different story and i think that is a possibility as i look at what might be coming down for this city down the road for some individuals depending on what happens in the coming elections so it is something to think about i don't know if people should be permitted to have extended absences if everybody takes a vacation guilty is right it's a non-compensated position go take your vacation but if people are going to be gone for an extended period of time and that's something that has to be discussed on the council as to what the visibility should be i don't think we're going to resolve this tonight this is a discussion thing so we might want to bring this to a work session but it's only seven o'clock so i'll entertain as much discussion as people have it's relatively early in the night so next sheriff did you want to speak on this issue you want your information bro do you have to leave oh i had something i gotta take care of one of the meantime we're good you want me to just he just wants to give us a piece of information i think it's gonna take a minute does anybody have an objection sheriff come on up we're gonna break and go back to the sheriff's report last month um i was able to find it i can't give you a lot of details involves a juvenile but uh the long and the short is that uh a juvenile was having some uh was in some therapy i remember didn't say that occurred back in july um on supposedly on the beach and went to a house maybe involving some drugs alcohol which ended up um you know involving a sexual encounter eventually and they were embarrassed about it and they didn't at the end of the day they didn't want investigated parents are uninvestigated but uh um and so it wasn't taken further but we don't know exactly where it occurred either but it was reported because the person lives in the city um they said occurred on a beach and then a house but we didn't even find out where those locations were so it was attributed to your stats however that doesn't mean it occurred here anyway it did occur okay does anybody else have any questions on that citizens council thank you for the follow up on that really appreciate it i think it sets us all at ease and hopefully the person will get to help get me okay absolutely thank you okay back to our discussion there's no one on the floor glenn to address the city attorney's comments one is this a real issue yes it's a real issue we we hit our stride at the end of the executive orders by the governor allowing us to take this to zoo meetings and sort of thing we were really beginning to hit our stride on that and now we are backsliding with this we've got jody calling in on a phone call who can barely be heard either way so obviously we're backsliding there and regardless of how this goes we need to get the technology in place to allow our residents to participate in this thing and again participate and attendance don't necessarily equate to one another okay the second thing is to advocate taking the legislative route well this is a legislative route here and it's within our sphere of influence and if you want to talk about lag let's talk about the legislative process at the state level or at the federal level here why not legislate and within our sphere of influence when we can get things moving within two to three monthly council meeting cycles rather than trying to ramp up a entire state or florida league of cities thing you want to talk about glacial speed you want to talk about lag well by the time we get something moving at the state level on this sort of thing we will long be gone that that's all i will uh say today robin no i was just going to say going back to this overall issue i'm in total support of updating our technology so in the rare cases of like you know for example like jody tonight um or are residents able to participate if they're not able to come but i'm not necessarily in favor of complete remote attendance as in i don't feel like coming in tonight because whatever so let me just do it and it'll still count or you know i mean we all have vacations but hopefully you don't have vacations more than four of the meetings so it shouldn't be an issue if you miss one because of vacation i have but you shouldn't be able to go to a second home and be a snowbird for six months and do your meetings from there because hey you're not in the city and b if that's what you're signing up for that's the lifestyle you want to leave more power to you but maybe this is in the position for you because you need to be involved and um going back to the glacial speed i agree that government all over the country is very slow but my interpretation of what fred was saying is that you don't want to be the first city to do it and something happened where it turns out to not be legal and then all our meetings don't count and our votes don't count on it back so it's kind of more to me i interpret as a safety in numbers if ten cities did it together then you have more of a lake to stand on but although i agree with you everything's slow and i don't think this is going to get resolved on the state level anytime soon but i think we definitely need to update the technology but as far as allowing remote attendance at the whim of a person because you just feel like it you don't feel like coming in no special instances yes like so i don't know how to reward that but that's just my input and i would recommend that you go through and look at the boilerplate resolution that are provided because there's actually guidance at the city level for determining what's an excusable attendee so i agree it shouldn't be just and i think people come to this job to do the best job possible and i think most people feel here that there is a a huge benefit to coming out and meeting the public and the residents and this is how business gets done it's done in person so uh what i would suggest is that we go ahead and take a look at the boilerplate and try to come up with a workable solution to this thing but i think it's something that needs to be done i think we need to do the technology side of it and we need to have some allowances for people to to excuse themselves and attendance and yet still participate not be physically present but participate in a governance of our community it's a council on the last round here so now i'm open up to the citizen comments victor i apologize if i knew i was going to address the city council i would have put on a tie but um while i'm not technically a city of your a resident of your city i'm hearing this discussion going back and forth and i'm my mind is turning because you guys are reinventing the wheel i have other towns that i work for that employ me to do these services for them and one of them is city of indian rocks beach and basically what we have set up there i spent a lot of time with city manager greg mims over there and we had the same discussions back and forth what they wanted to do and have participation and have audience participation and what we set up was a zoom meeting and basically i have my cameras that i connect to a computer that streams live to youtube to facebook to zoom all at the same time so anybody can tune in and watch it and then whatever is going on in the city council is like a active participant so the the viewers can see my camera focusing on who on whoever's talking whether it's a resident that's attending they also open it up for a limited audience but that to me would be what you guys are looking for because it just connects everyone and people can come to the meeting or not come to the meeting if a commissioner is exposed to covet or feels not safe then they can just connect to the meeting from their house and do it that way but whoever's speaking at the actual meeting is captured on the cameras with the system that i have set up for them so um so i just thought i'd share even though i'm not a resident i want to speak thank you so perfect any other citizens bring it back to council and i will say i again have victor's invitation i did in the summer time when we were exploring zoom and the other stuff i did sit in on one of those indian rocks thing it worked fine it worked real fine so it was just like being there and i wasn't there so that technology is here he roasted you know not saying you have to use him but he did a great job anyone else i i think at this point honey i don't think we're going to go through this resolution and pick it apart tonight it seems to me that there's interest at least in consensus if i hear everyone correct i'm not speaking for anyone but my understanding but i think we definitely want to look at the technology we definitely want to discuss this some more and i think this definitely should get into one of our next work session and try and hammer this thing out so we can bring it back in and see what you know meantime perhaps the city attorney again i'm not asking you to be the supreme court i looked at that thing and you know there's 10 different opinions and 10 different reasons and one says you have to be sick and one says you have to be working i mean i don't know what we're doing with it but we're gonna i'll tell you one thing whatever you tell me as city attorney is where the protection lies and that's where i'm going to go with it myself so my response to that would be that the real uh key between now and when you let's just discuss this is for me to look and see if there's what kate's law is there and i mean you've looked it up as in your job i look up stuff there are times you you may find three cases and there's fines times there's two hundred and i don't know which one this will fall into but they're you know there's typically at some point if a statute's been around a while there's a dispositive ruling somewhere along the line and that that pretty well sets the benchmark and until the legislature changes the law and that's that gives you the the uh criteria that you should be applying so that that would be the thing i will do and then you know come back and be ready to tell you uh this this is what the criteria that you really ought to be focused on isn't enough time is it enough time for that i mean i think we probably have i don't think we even have a scheduled work session right yet but i mean typically about two weeks from now would be if we do one that'll be fine okay the the other thing i was going to say is that the the discussion kind of changed and my my question is is now do you want to do a policy related to the establishing a quorum or do you want to do a policy that relates to putting in place technology so that citizens can participate from from a remote place and to me those are two different kind of things i think it's all on the table i think we brought it all out so i don't think anything was excluded at this point other than the idea of us probably meeting remotely unless unless we can get something a little bit more firm in terms of case law but i think everything at least the way i heard it everything was on the table so i don't think we've excluded anything and i mean in terms of creating a city-wide policy you know if readers will have brought this motion but um we can at any point call this question and move this thing forward but i think where it's moving is not saying we're definitely creating the policy but we're moving it into a detailed work session with a little bit more information from you and maybe a little bit more chance to review this resolution that glenn glenn gave us think about this some more so we understand exactly what we're looking for how we're going to deal with this um because i i agree i mean stuff comes up you know people do have business arrangements and what are you supposed to do you shouldn't have to forfeit an otherwise good career on council because you get called away for a couple of weeks you know so i i i think we should be as flexible as we could be within reason because reasonable what did you say reasonable people doing reasonable things something like that so that was a famous quote i thought it was yours any other counselor comments read the slope you have the last word well i would like to obviously see us move forward with this so i'm just going to ask that we do put this on the work session and get some information as far as costs to update our equipment or that gentleman can provide us with the proposal when he what he can do and what he can't do and then at that point we can look at getting a change made that is sufficient for our citizens as well as the quorum and all of that so we can take care of it all that's all i understand so if i get this correct we're going to the question was to consider consideration of creating a city of bellar beach policy to specifically address remote attendance as well as a quorum physical presence for the rapidly changing manner of conducting business electronically so and again anybody jump in if i'm saying this wrong a yes vote we'll get this into the committee get fred riley working on this victor if he wants to do a little presentation or some information to us show us what we've done in indian rocks i think that would be helpful everybody get a chance to review this resolution so we're not killing this we're just moving it to the really like it's the next level and i think that's what what we were seeking initially mr dunn right okay so is that correct i've stated it correctly okay then now clerk please call the rule yes vote we'll bring it forward council member shirley yeah council member slope yes councilmember aki yes council member beam council member gattis aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo all right so this will move forward to our next work session mr riley as we discussed please good luck whatever research you can come up with any case law or what any other cities may have done would be helpful victory you have the opportunity just work right through the city manager give them whatever presentation or come to that meeting and if you have the ability show us what they've done or you know get everyone in on whatever you want to tell us okay thank you all right so that concludes item number 10. one uh item number 11 is unfinished business do we have any unfinished business just just one thing i want to bring up is the sign i gave you a packet a couple weeks ago gave you some quotes and i i guess what i'm trying to do is find out from the console so we can go forward with this the sign's been gone for 90 days and i think it's time to do something and i know there's mixed feelings about it and i don't know if you brought your pictures with you tonight but if you do [Music] this this was the scenario that we gave for the digital uh or electronic just with words not with flashy pictures not santa claus or any of that and this is the side which is kind of a mixture which means uh not much wording that's going to go in this digital and it's still i guess i look at it it's still a sign like we had before and i think just my recommendation is the digital sign provides a better opportunity for things that happen like a hurricane or information we can get out we can get it on there remotely we're not talking about putting pictures up there or anything we're talking about putting words up to them so this uh the sign if we even took the digital off and just did this it's it's three thousand dollars save it again we didn't hear that number if if we took the digital office and just made it similar to the sign we had before the estimate that the guy gave us was forty thousand dollars of course it's going to go out to bid this sign is about 37 000. the duplicate sign is a mixture [Music] and one is 45 000 because it's a mixture sign so uh what i would like to do is get this thing out to bid it's going to take some time we've got 30 000 in the budget and we're probably going to receive 10 to 11 000 from the insurance so i think we've got the money to to do the project it's just i need the constantly we have to give you this via resolution or some other type of formal instruction give it the dollars well you'll have to approve the bid once it's out there and you've already authorized me to go bid but i just want some some consensus from the console where do you want to go with this it's time we've been back and forth on this for i don't know several months already moved forward let's take consensus i don't have my picture leave the hybrid one let's go through these prices again full digital is 45 000. no no the digital sign the estimate he provided us was 37 000 that's that's the estimate he gave us when we start mixing that's when the prices go up because you're doing some of this and some of that and he gave us prices of 45 and 47 for mixing them then he gave me a price for just what i'll call the old sign where you had to go out and put the letters up and do things like that and that was three thousand dollars more than the digital sign it's less than you know so plus it's old technology old technology is expensive you know so uh this is a no-brainer some of the concern by the council was the fact that uh we're going to put something like disney world up there and that's not the intent the intent is letters not you know santa claus or uh you know so i'm just asking the constantly kind of give me some direction the the uh communications committee recommended that we go to the digital side that they didn't recommend that so i'm just asking you to give me some feedback so we can put this out on the street and see where the numbers come actually and those in vapor keeping the old sun you know the old style sign but if it's gonna cost us more to do digital and more work that doesn't make sense so i i don't think it makes sense to do that that's my opinion so yeah i'm actually in favor of the one where you can add the verbiage down here for emergencies like the hurricane and stuff but this is the one that i would like to go ahead and look at it was only what do you say about two three thousand more no no that one's up in the mid forties it's several thousand more what you're doing is you're mixing stuff yeah you're still gonna pay the premium for the the uh what i wanna call the the uh electronic message portion which is just this and then you're gonna pay on top of that to put this up there also and your space is limited also okay but for this going back to the safety of our community it'd be nice to have that capability in case you know it is an evacuation plan or something like that so for the safety of the community i really think we ought to go ahead and spend the additional money and get the one that we can make an announcement when something is really important i just think you're going to get the same message out with the other okay glenn is the one here holding the straight digital yes okay all right can i ask a question about that that one is that correct yes you could you could make it pink or purple if you wanted to so whenever something was important you could change the color of the text right and that sort of would would give you the same effect yeah when there's an emergency like a hurricane like we had uh let's see six weeks ago you know i could be sitting uh i could evacuate and be putting the message up there telling even though there's no residence here well the one since there's an issue there's going to be a few because they stayed last time but at least we'd have information now okay well that's a good idea that since we can change the color of the letters so i do like that well i would say save the eleven thousand dollars and go with the digital i mean that will solve everything changing colors make important things stand out man say it's time to evolve with the times and go a little more digitally council member shirley go ahead okay so it's hard to decipher because these aren't like labeled a and b or style you know extra line whatever but when i'm looking at the two you gave us the mixed medium one with the bigger board the informational board i think doesn't look nearly as nice as the one that's just just a digital and you know i'm not saying that the digital cons as long as we are only putting digital lettering in there that's not a constant feed of information the stationary you know we need to talk about that what how it's going to be um use utilized but because it is digital the message can move we can put pictures and images up and it can look like disney world or it can be a stationary message and i think that as long as we put some uh guidance in place of what that message is going to look like part launched to whoever happens to decide what they want to put up there today that it's probably that the sony lifting only digital information is probably the best looking choice and doesn't look nearly as busy as the one but the multimedia one so that's my input any other council comments and i am going to open this because we're going to take a a directional vote here so i'm going to open it up to the citizens if there's anything we normally don't do this on unfinished business but we are this time because we're voting citizens any comments on this okay then we'll come back to the council if we're ready we can vote them i can vote by price straight digital however we want to talk about just clarify this is what i'm going to put out to bid because right this is from the estimates from one vendor we might get a better price correct you know so we're going to give you direction of which one we want you to put out today yeah okay so this is the one i'm working with that's straight i call that the straight digital one yeah thirty seven thousand dollars on this with this vendor right okay anybody else have any comments look not we'll just have paddy take it one at a time only comment i have is it's a it's a hard kill swallow and it's very expensive it has to be done and uh i think that's probably the best case scenario i think we just take it by person just asking what they want let's make sure we're clear and we'll tally the votes here council member aki straight digital councilmember beam digital straight digital right councilmember smoke straight digital vice mayor gun straight digital mayor manziel straight digital so it's unanimous mr graves you know where you're heading now so see what the best place you can get we'll put it we'll put it out to bed you've already authorized me to do that so wonderful um thank you i had two items of unfinished business from the last meeting minutes um just a quick update and you can give them to us there's one of them if you don't want to talk about it don't say anything um the first one was the meeting with matt mcnally uh regarding the code revision change i think he was the man who came in here he's asking us to actually change our code and then we put an option for him to meet with yourself and councilwoman surely he was an option out of what could ever happen just follow it up yes we we did meet with him and uh our engineer and uh i had a discussion with fred about the definition of habitable space and i think we've rectified that i will tell you that over the holidays they came in with multiple other uh versions of questions about what our code says and what they would like to do so this he didn't really spill the beans i guess is what i'm saying he he he did a one hit and now we're going to do a five six and seven hit so uh larry and i have talked and uh we're gonna send them something back because you know he came in well i want to raise the elevation of the lot well that's not going to work it's not fair to the people who live around you or i'm going to do something else can i put my steps in the setback another good example uh that we haven't allowed anyone else to do it and i you know if he wants to submit a variance that's that's up to him but that that's just the generalization it's it's kind of like well we'll start with this and now we're going to add some things right so so nothing more for counsel to do right now thank you for following them you know yeah that's that's second one which you do not feel compelled to answer um we will get you in the vice mayor we're going to talk about supplemental law enforcement i don't want to go into too much detail here just want to find out if we're moving along that direction i i've been out of town for a week and the vice mayor was of course here so we're going to sit down and talk to that and we did have some over the weekend i haven't got the report back yet we'll see how that went we had a two days and four hours spotter and deputy that cost us roughly a thousand dollars for that today so we'll just pick out some some other dates and uh figuring out how we can work it out where we can fit some of that money into the just by transferring some money out of maybe code enforcement uh and then we'll give you a big number in the end and see if you want more how's that i'll be interested in that report that was a busy weekend good call on the pick that was definitely a weekend to do seeing what was going on there was a lot of a lot of stuff going on that weekend so yeah you know it uh because we have to do a contract each time it's a it's not a blanket contract that's that's how it works so but we've already done that so we'll come back with something i'll sit down with the vice mayor and have some more discussion and if any of you have any input when you think you know a specific date send me an email i don't okay uh i just wanted to uh let you know you've given me the financial encode reports the bid for the video surveillance cameras and the building is going out on wednesday i've also put at your desk the code enforcement or i mean the strategic plan update of what we had with the for the staff these were the objectives that the concert gave us this year it's kind of an update of where we're going and what we're doing with those uh taking care of a sign occasionally we have someone come in and talk about uh the check valves not working so at the last storm i decided to get a little uh salinity tester it's a little thing you stick in the water because everybody's telling me oh no the check valve's not working it's it's uh salt water so you know you stick this thing down in there and get the water test well i did two samples i did one out of the gutter on 9th street because i hear a lot about the check valves not working over there and the gutter water came in the salinity was at 270 parts per million the salinity for the salt water that's sitting right out here supposedly coming in the street also was 4291 parts per minute so it's just something that i kind of devised so when we hear those things we can go back and kind of test the water and it's you know it's lame and stuff but at least we can be able to explain that hey it's it's not the check valve it's just water that's in the street from you know the storm or something so uh that's something we did and the people that uh bellevue out of the states are probably going to be very happy because they're going to get a bellar beach stimulus check people that paid will get some money back depending on what they did if they had underground they'll get about 2 300 back if their house was already underground and if they pre-paid up front uh if they had overhead and prepaid they'll get about hundred dollars back what that does to the assessment the people that had overhead to their house and uh and the underground uh their sixteen hundred and eleven dollars is going to be reduced somewhere around two hundred and forty dollars these are estimates right now but they look pretty good uh the person that just had uh the twelve hundred and sixty seven dollar assessment which is that you already have your services to the house they'll get back about 139 when i say 139 that means your dollar 1267 is going to go down 139. if you have the 1611 it's going to go down about 240 which we will take that excess money that's left that's left over we'll pay that down on the loan to get the assessment down there's uh i think it's 25 people that paid everything up front so they'll get a reimbursement check so we'll firm these numbers up we had a savings of about 380 000 so over the project so very fortunate the last phase of it i haven't got a definitive answer from duke uh on when they're gonna finish that last phase which is basically going down the road shouldn't interrupt anybody other than uh probably mitch crotch house and house across the street for taking the final polls out so that's just an update on that project it started out at 2.2 million and it ended up about 1 million 830 000 so uh and that was a lot of great support from the council members and the residents and very helpful so you know i want to thank you know i think that was very important to pass on to the residents in the neighborhood they worked very well with the contractor they you know if we had issues they worked very well with that we're getting ready to go we've submitted for a bid for the undergrounding of uh dope boulevard from duke and i don't know what the concert's thought is but i've got a thought that we maybe look see if it's possible to put even silver lights in their place if we've got the money in the budget to do that to eliminate that monthly cost so any questions that's all i have i had one unrelated but before we do that you beat washington congratulations on the stimulus note going back to the people so good job with that unfortunately i got one of those mayor calls today and the person asked that i bring up at the council meeting um so i want to bring it up and i didn't investigate it i got this information this morning so i'm just going to syndicate it to the city manager perhaps a visit will find the problem but patricia hoffman you don't have to go any further you know all about it okay um i guess they've written two legal letters can you just go out and apparently these these construction people across the street will not move and they can't get out of their driveway i guess her husband dr hoffman is treating coping patients at the emergency room um you know he can't get out of his driveway so i heard this i'm like you know what let me get this over to win and apparently danny dardy was very very helpful um but maybe we could just get explained to these guys across the street in the construction that they got to keep the driveways area free for them well here just to clarify this there's a little problem there because the guy's building it just because this lot is across the street her driveway is there if if they bring a truck up to unload we'll say lumber to build the house and they're on the other side of the street that's still leaving that pass lane for them to get out of their driveway i don't i don't think at any time the driveway has been blocked it's just that there's been a truck across the street and [Music] the other morning there i got an email last week that said the word murder here before seven o'clock well were they working no they were coming to work there wasn't a hammer knocking or anything of that nature so this is an ongoing situation and unfortunately on 15th street two vacant lots two houses at the same time next door to each other what happened to i know i had to do this and i think you even took pictures of mine because i did it so well but you used to have to put in parking pads on your property so that you got the cars off the street well no no no no what the biggest complaint has been is them delivering materials to their construction site and it's it's only that one person no one else on the street has said anything there is a person that's questioning some drainage on the back of one line which we'll get that resolved when the instruction is done but just like when your house was built you probably drove a unless you did it all in a pickup you had a tractor trailer come up and they unloaded the supplies and took them off to try to put them in your yard well you you probably took half the street or a third of the street so the house across the street had to make a little better turn backing out of the driveway happened to me the other day on my stream where hey lynn yes actually leaving um the other morning it was probably seven a.m they had two distracted trailers of wonk being delivered there is nowhere for that to pool except that firmly going you know they took us off pool alarms um and then they have to offload with forklifts and that is just part of construction i mean there is no way around it they were there i appreciate if they were there early it was cumbersome i was a little aggravated but it's part of the church as part of when we have new construction on the beach they and the two guys drive the trucks handled it very professionally they did their best but make up and hook space to foot but they still park from ball boulevard at the turn lane on the causeway and they did it they did their best job to get offloaded as quickly as possible and out of here so i commend this for doing a good job yeah so so you know danny's been there many times i've talked to it's just an issue with and you're really in the early stages of these houses so we're going to hear about this for a long time i have my number so um i'm sure i'll hear about it look and i'll call her again thank you and danny they were very happy apparently with his visit so maybe utilize that to the best of you know what you can i i'm not taking sides i don't know what happened i wasn't out there and i'm not gonna go look at people unloading stuff it is a as jody says it's part of construction but if you can't really get out of your driveway that's a different story so we kind of want to work together every time that i've been there when it's been a situation the truck has been on the edge of the property or partially in the street so yes that that guy probably did have his forklift out and he did he had his forklift out he went out the street picked up the lumber and drove around the truck and went to the other side because he he wants to be stable kicking it off the truck any house that's built unfortunately [Music] it's uh a situation where there's two houses being built at the same exact same time and you're aware of it so whatever okay interestingly i i went down and looked at that situation and uh more concern for me and i've already discussed this with the city manager is the damage being done to the streets the pavements and the uh the current the valley curves there and we talked about coming up with some idea i mean we live in a highly desirable area people are going to buy lots put up large homes which means lots of concrete trucks lots of blocks things like that and we need to start figuring this into perhaps how do we pass that through to the owner or to the contract or something but we can't always be following around these new homes repairing valley curves and things like that so that i just want to interject that that'll be coming up in uh some of these objectives and i think that's an excellent point i mean i know when i did mine when you came out and visited and said you're going to repave the street so up until that point we were trying to be as careful as possible or a little less careful after that but um why can't we charge a deposit when we when somebody is building a big house a big you know something big and just like you know a security deposit on a rental property you get it back and then goes out and takes pictures before the thing and if you like glenn is saying the valley curbs are all cracked and the street's all gouged up well you know there's going to be an assessment for that you're not going to get your refund back you keep it clean you don't gouge it all up and destroy us because really we can't keep replacing this stuff so many streets are brand you know you're doing them brand new and then people come in and trash them up so we don't want that that's not progress yeah the vice mayor and i talked about that doing something where we like a returnable impact fee mayor manziel yes okay jody yeah just did real quickly on that subject i had mentioned this early on um but i think that we need to really take a look at our impact piece one for have um a builder bond some road improvements because there is a possibility a little damp jump but i certainly do believe that we should be charging a little more impact babies because the damage to us goes to they're doing roadways are incredible i mean and i'm probably one of those guilty parties i look on harrison avenue and there's a weight limit on our bridge and there's been a lot of houses built that required heavy concrete trucks and blocks to come over that bridge that probably exceeded the weight limit um but you know i think that it's a this is a conversation or work session but it would be impact fees and or um just getting a plan or hiring a professional planner to take a look at our city and talk about what how are we to handle new construction what's the best way to end one but maybe we should add that to north session next time everyone's nodding yes it looks like so yes can we add that yes impact these deposits what you know let's have a discussion of this and the last thing you're you're going to need to uh the typically third monday work session is a holiday yes so we need to pick another either monday or another day that's compatible with the concept just keep it that same week go tuesday or wednesday that's martin luther king's birthday yeah up to you i'm available so i'll confirm wednesday everybody after the holiday if you want to do it that week pick a day tuesday wednesday what's what's the best tuesday would work tuesday what specific date uh i think it's the 16th so be a tuesday is that right it might be the 18th i'm not 16. that would be the 19th and i'm not available that night that would be the 19th i'm not available that night oh [Music] wednesday the 20th for the work session would that be good yeah at that time wednesday the 20th of this when is is there i thought i saw something about a candidate tonight legal women voters what is that that's thursday the next night okay okay okay it's going to be virtual okay well it's virtual okay okay so wednesday the 20th and um how do you advise us when the deadline is for any other items in the work session yes city manager anything else thank you you're welcome thank you city clerk nothing city clerk i have something for you and it's a good thing um last month we spoke about uh writing a letter to the city of madeira beach and um they had provided us with some detailed letters that were written by mayor serrano and patty knew about it and i saw her in the parking lot she said i sent them to you and i said oh thank you and i said well i don't know if i'll be able to edit them she said i already did um i can't thank you enough i was super super heavy and busy that week i don't think i would have gotten that out patty just so everybody knows edited those things right down i didn't have to change one word i virtually signed them they went out and i thank you very very much you made that happen and i never asked you to do it you just did that on your own so very great proactivity and very much appreciated thank you thank you you're welcome uh city council comments it's an odd month so we start reading school uh yes i just would like to make sure that i thank councilmember shirley she's the one that put together that lunch in not the city for our sheriff's officers as well as the city staff great turnout it was paid for and sponsored by many of the people that live in our community so i would like to encourage her to make that a yearly event and continue to grow it so i hope you consider that councilmember shirley other than that i uh thank also the city staff for all the work you've done over the holidays making sure everything went smooth that's thank you so much i i appreciate you guys because i was concerned with the red shock spoke that we didn't share the information and i didn't talk about the fact that we were going to do that at the december 7th meeting i believe it was and it was a very very short notice when we got approval from the sheriff and i had a great support of a small group of residents that were aware of it and reached out to me to do his help and we raised quite a bit of money on short notice we're able to provide lunch for 12 minutes and get them each um thirty dollars of gift certificates for local businesses that you know provided a copy of lunch or what-have-you so we went to our maggie mae's bellar coffee and the bel air market and um and we had a great support from residents that penny has you know kept the tally of the money that was donated and we still have funds available so if this is something that everyone wants to participate in that we can do more of a widespread city participation we would probably look to do something again in the spring i believe we have over 100 sitting in a reserve account for um future opportunities so something we can talk about later but just literally know um and then also yes then thank you for sharing that we met with matt mcnally with both of our homes uh sorry to hear that you know we still have some open issues with him i thought we took care of that but does this regarding the meeting again on experience um where they want to build a home against power so hopefully we get to the bottom of that and get them started on a new project that will bring us some more revenue to state so thank you guys for participating and sorry i could be there tonight thank you jody i hope you feel well um thank you basically all i want to say is uh i'd like to encourage the council to uh while we're discussing uh policies for virtual meetings during troubled times that we move simultaneously to uh to go ahead and do something get some equipment in here i don't want to wait until i kick it down the road until we've come up with a perfect policy this is something we should have already had the communication committee recommended it we were discussing it cope it's been here for a long time now a year it's time to resolve this and uh and give everyone the opportunity to uh to dial in from their home if they want to and that's about all that thank you dave um mark dean lynn this is kind of a question for you we periodically talked about the stormwater easements throughout the city between the homes i just wonder if we have if they've worked on collecting where they're at or at least what i'm on a map as far as kyle yeah we haven't we haven't done anything with that we've done uh we've got all the piping and everything's on the map so we know where they're at we haven't researched any easements because that's going to take some time to dig through because we don't have any to my knowledge we don't have any real file of the easements that may have been given in you know as an example i've got a house that wants to construct on in its third street there's an easement going through their property we don't even know what it's for so we're doing research to find things like that right and the the other one i know we talked about the sewer lines from causeway to 19th street right now which way the store goes in that area and i just wanted to i've been able to find out just where it goes so we can i know these minutes well just before christmas i had a meeting with pinellas utilities and they're going to provide me something but it won't be what i want to call a public director because they don't want to share the utility locations they they basically say it's a security issue but they they're going to provide me with something if i need to look for something so they're in this process and the other thing i know we discussed the pathways on the north and south side of the city and the uh well problems with the utilities and the pathways that need to be moved well the utilities that there is something in the florida statutes that say it's a transportation project you can request them to move them at no cost to you yeah i know that for a fact as i used it where i was previously um we need to do a little more discussion on the pathways because my thought is if if we are going to pay them then uh we need to do that with the stormwater project so it's not a big chunk because the estimate we got was 165 000 to do that and i think the in pieces and i have had some feedback from some of the neighbors that don't want to pay it so but we have to figure out where we want to go with that and how you want to handle it okay and then i had driven through the city a couple of times over the holidays and there's a lot of low hanging trees and some trees that are by the street curbs the valley curves well danny we had a list that he went around and sent i think it was like 30 properties where he left courtesy notices and he is following up on the people that are supposed to trim the trees we did that with trees we did it with dots we did it with sea walls and you know we just it's it's going to be a process because we basically took pictures uh dave and jody were kind enough to take us out they took me out before the storm and jody took laura out after the storm so we had multiple pictures and and the code enforcement person is following up on that some of my neighbors are very concerned about some of the knocks that are rickety out there and there's really nothing that going on since the storm went through right he spot he's giving him a courtesy notice that there's damage or there is uh dave and i went out there wasn't a major i wouldn't say there was any major sea wall damage it was more cramped caps uh you know across the top but pieces falling off for the most part the sea walls were in pretty good shape uh so that that's a good thing uh and it appears that over the years a lot of people have upgraded their sea walls it's just the cap on some of them have some chunks out of them that they've got to get those repaired i know some of the information i gave you that we reviewed they're recommending weep holes right i know the older sea walls do not so we may have a code for it anyway but something to think about okay thank you very much um i know we've talked about this before i'm surprised marvin didn't bring it up but speed limit reduction we talked about it on golf possibly what do we need to do to get that discuss more or i think you need to discuss it in a work session and then whatever the performance of the console is at that point in time patty can we add that to the next work session just to start the conversation i just don't want to keep kicking it down i'm talking about for golf the lord and that's all wrong as an alternative those people who have access to facetime you may consider that as an alternative for calling in here my experience has shown that the voice and sound quality is a lot better and there's plenty of ipads floating around the city staff and uh you might be able to get a visual on who's speaking and that sort of thing but that's i just throw that out there as an alternative thing the sound quality is much better on the facetime you need to do that two city manager passed out the uh updated objectives i told everybody to take a look at that and send he checked the priorities there the city managers astutely started to see linkages in some of these things that may take it out of just the regular normal sort priorities so take a look and in your mind if you can pick up connections between some of these things that hey you know there may be efficiencies or economies to do this earlier or later because just like the paving the pathways may be more appropriate with the storm water improvement sort of things there interestingly uh traffic congestion is number four on his list right now and a hard question we may need to ask ourselves is the uh whether or not we need to keep that island that's right their causeway and uh go to boulevard because that seems to be a huge major source but i digress there undergrounding major kudos to lynn rings and laura beam they're the guys who really made those coming in under budget possible i mean some of that was lost in the translation you know a misinterpretation of a stimulus check to the bei resident as well basically these guys made that project come in under budget we're still dealing with trying to get some of the other stuff done but that's why money is coming back and that's really a segue into i ride my bicycle around and boy this place could really be something if we started banding together some of these other streets hibiscus all those roads back there on the north side harrison howard all of those places could really be a show place and it's it's a matter of just finding the trick we need to band these together and make it an economy of scale to get these things done but well you look at some of the the work that's been done it could be a huge improvement for the city that's it thank you very much thank you um i don't have any comments so with that i'm asking germany okay all in favor aye good night everyone thanks for coming out"
