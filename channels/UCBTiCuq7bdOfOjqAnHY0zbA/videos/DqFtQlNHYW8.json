    "transcript": "okay good evening everyone it is now 6 p.m at the November 28th special council meeting and uh let's bring this meeting to order please rise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance in the United States history [Music] thank you council member Frank Banker council member Leslie Notaro council member Lloyd Roberts your council member Mike Sable your vice mayor Jody Shirley mayor Dave Gaddis interim city manager Kyle riefler here and City attorney Randy Mora the president I have an announcement to make for parks and rec board normally it would be at the end of the meeting but I will probably move the music and they will kill me at the Holiday social they will now be having heavy appetizers and Suites for everyone who needs so that means you don't have to go by McDonald's on our agenda tonight for the sake of efficiency I would like to address item two first uh and then address uh would anyone like to make a motion to amend the agenda by swapping items one and two ocean motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second a second Sacramento might say all in favor aye aye any opposed the only agenda is approved all right we're on to item one this is approval of the city manager agreement before we begin with the Council of any citizens like to address the Council on this topic cool all right mailed to the council so first do I have a motion to uh for approval of the city manager agreement motion to approve the agreement as written and presented motion made by Frank Baker he'll have a second second second I'm going to give them the Judy Shirley Mr Mora because you ought to disagreement you have this report thank you mayor and uh thank you council members I know it's been uh some work for you to get to the point of the point of hopefully it will be the final approval of a manager to occupy this role uh at our last meeting we discussed some of the particulars of the draft agreement and on last week on Wednesday since you correspondents summarizing the changes for benefit of all uh the contract has been amended to account for a three-year term the salary is a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars for the first two years with third year subject to a potential salary increase commensurate with that further employees subject of course to your discretionary review when I say that it is a three-year contract I do so wish to underscore that all of the charter at least the charter officials under contract serve as at will at the pleasure of the council and that can be terminated at any time subject to the other contractors that are replaced in your chart as for nature one of the one of the revisions Mr eclair had in his draft concerned the flexibility of schedule not seeking to work anything less than an ordinary work week but just in recognition of nights that can be late and otherwise some flexibility and that not same virginity you would expect of an employee it's a reflection of that as a executive position the other is adding language requiring the manager to retain insurance coverage based on the mayor's feedback the other one was professional development there was a lot of discussion and I specifically I contacted Lynn Tipton with the league of cities who used to administer the credentialing process for managers to understand how the process and depending on where you are in your career what titles you've had what responsibilities are there or that can be anywhere from a two to seven year process I mean that then they'll have to take into account s Mr reefers resume and otherwise so the way it's written is that the manager agrees to make a reasonable and good faith effort to work towards and to the extent possible complete uh the icmas voluntary credentialing program through the Florida chapters focused curriculum because you know Isis iccma is the international city and county Managers Association Florida Division does its own credentialing we're targeted towards Board of law much in the same way with what we do for Florida policy Mission set the process shall shall include submitting the requisite application applications collaborating with the senior advisors program which we talked about that they're not just there to help recruit they're as a sounding board and they do have mentorship element um so pursuing mentorship opportunities and competing completing online or in-person educational training and the manager agrees to provide you with quarterly update to the city council as efforts progress and obstacles to completing that all attention voluntary credentialing program Mr reefer is aware of this added language it's also intended to not be so rigid as so you know heaven forbid something happens like we have a hurricane in here and like well you didn't take your classes this month you know there's some explaining what are the obstacles what are the issues where am I is am I on track and is this something we still wish to invested in continuous accounting for that and adding the CV the only real outstanding issue to place in this contract that as you make your motions tonight I would like for you to be clear about is the effective date I spoke with Heather guadagali your the person who does your finances so based on past experience that I found it's best to make the effective date somewhere that aligns with the pay period either the middle beginning and however that works best in speaking with her depending on when you wish to make it active basically Mondays are best so if you wish to make an effective today he would be in the middle of a pay period and all those all those benefits would begin today uh going forward counters having been this whole business day and onward if you wish to do it retroactively that that pay period began on the 21st so you could make it retroactive and then the full that full period of the 24 th would be a full pay period at that rate and if you wish to start a future date the 5th of December is your next pay period but ultimately I would say starting on Monday I'll see you which Monday would be uh most uh desirable for efficiency on the administrative side of this agreement so that's the only thing that I think needs and that I would request your additional input on provided you don't have any further input on the Amendments and discussions we've had and Mr riesler and I have exchanged drafts he was amenable to the terms as they're written in the draft circulated thank you very much counselor I would be immutable to it starting today after all you've been in a negotiation back and forth um foreign I think a middle of a pay period although it's workable doesn't make a lot of sense to me we're going to have two different pay rates within a paid period he's been doing the job wonderfully as the interim so I think that's right will be to the 21st would be my my take time it's material retroactive June 1st but I don't think that's going to fly so I think we're going to get first all right I don't have a problem with going retroactive uh because it looks like it's one of the video if I uh don't go that way um one of the questions I have for you mission reoper is do you have any problems with the preliminary objectives you see anything unreasonable or looking like it could be impossible for you to complete I I don't see anything unreasonable I might ask for a little more clarification on the dashboard or scorecard for the city but then about each one of these I can do what pages so the the what at the topic says appendix a and then immediate it and while you're flipping it up there's one other term I forgot to mention as as Mr riesler is currently an employee with the new fiscal year he gained three persons three right three three uh personal lead days that don't count against the Cleveland other category you have so you can draw those down before you get to those and this kind of this contract contemplates him keeping those I see Transitions and it hasn't benefited two years within a year right yeah those won't carry overly on them for sure I believe that number two would be if difference video to you how to deliver the contents notes and how tomatoes are fully aware of how well you're doing obviously we know where we are now and you have a you have a link to achieve plus the ongoing projects the dashboard is scorecard I know that we had a prior member who truly believed in metrics maybe to not to that point of being so brave or but still we would like to to have a scorecard some way to keep up with knowing where you are in your progress does that sound reasonable yes yes with an emphasis on the Strategic plan books [Music] I have no more comments or any of the comments from the council yes [Music] [Music] okay um we have a motion on the table and uh now I believe it's time to take this two vote but before we do that we need to equip we need to make sure that we're going agreement on the effective date we have two or three right now to reaching consensus over that yeah the time with me find you okay great so here we would retroactively spray and pay change affected on the 21st all right any other questions Mr Moore none here thank you very much all right in that case Patty I'd like to do this by roll call please council member Banker yes council member notero yes council member Roberts aye aye council member stable yes vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess I am so the motion passage unanimously Mr Morgan you are authorized for receiving the agreement and congratulations city manager [Applause] I want to thank you for the opportunity to to these past five months so you manager and working with you guys it's been a pleasure to look forward to many years of working in the future and we um appreciate you tolerating our

presentations I'm going to ask you to stand and then we'll invite the counselor to ask you questions okay that my name is Mark Chester I am a retired teacher coach during that time of 35 years of teaching coaching I've had any opportunities to have leadership positions in schools that I attended and also the school districts that I worked in and I've been retired now for six years we moved here a little over three years ago and I love this community and I just have decided to put myself out there and help serve I have never thought about getting involved in local politics at all until our oh about a year before our last election and I started talking to my neighbors about how things were going you know what's going on here because we love this place that's so neat and we heard some things that were pretty appalling and astonishing and so I started doing some investigating in I found kind of crazy things I heard were actually true so I did all I could as I got involved to help make sure we got back to some formal seat so it's like that out there and I will say this too in doing this makes me have a whole new appreciation for people that do what you do and put yourself out there and serve I don't have any agenda except serving my community I feel like I'm a good listener feel like I would be willing to work very hard I probably the least experienced person I've never held any position on any city council or any type of board spot but anybody whoever has served always had their first time I remember when I got my first coaching position I hadn't had one before and if I hadn't been given the opportunity I would never and my wife's calling which was my wife's calling to be able to do it so I just want to say you know I would like to put myself out there and serve this community if that's what you find like for me to do I think I could work in a very collegial manner and uh you know help keep this community wonderful and you know help make sure things like how things got before it ever happened again that's that's where I am as far as that goes thank you very much Mr Chester I have one question is it all right if I drink one of these yes we've got a little parched thanks Mr Roberts yeah what did you chose well I coached everything but football is my passion I'm very passionate about sports in general football in particular and now that I'm retired I'm really passionate about so I'm I'm floating right now I've been willing to work with people that are even from Ohio and so with that at um High School level Middle School and High School level half my career I spent as a defense coordinator at different high schools I spent a year and a half at University High School in Orlando and we when I was there we won the only playoff game they ever won now you can wait to feel like a little part of that I love football I I'd be much more comfortable talking about why you don't run cover zero whole game and how to defend triple auction in this yeah so uh and this doesn't have to be uh necessarily a football related but why we're coaching um those young men what were some of the what was probably the biggest issue or challenge that ever that ever came across from you when you're dealing with young people you you the one that you have to be sure of is that you always do the right thing and you are a role model so you have to make sure you are constantly putting yourself out there and doing what you need to do I've had many times where I had to deal with some really crazy criminal issues of using their children many things 35 years in many states Michigan Texas Minnesota Florida California and then I wound up finally in Texas again where I finished my career but uh you know dealing with some you know interesting people and you always have to make sure you're you're representative of the school you know you have to always make sure you never do anything to bring this honor on yourself the team and your school and I was able to do that in 35 years at all the places where I taught and coached thank you the good questions yes yeah um when something you know goes forward for public office you know I'll ask you what do you want to do first I mean we always hear I'm going to work hard but you've seen the city you've got to kind of figure of the pulse what would you like to start pursuing I didn't say I wanted to work hard I want to work smart um I there are things like I want to just make sure that all the rules that we're supposed to be doing that make sense are being followed and doing so in a way where we are not a nanny state but where things are being done in a smart fashion I also think because of our community being on the water that we have issues that are unique to other places like flooding like building you know what are the rules is it okay to have a house going up for two years you know being under construction for a very long time with progress and also what we do as far as like flooding when people are having construction done are they following the rules as far as keeping the uh you know the sewage open to where we don't have flooding it's great I mean where we are you're going to have some flooding issues so what what can we do to help make things like that matter I would say traffic issues are another you know anything we can do like that but I just love our community and I would like to do my part to help make it not make it but keep it great I think this is a wonderful Community with a lot of really neat people in it I haven't met anybody so far that I didn't like they might not like me but I like everybody that I've met so far it's great okay your follow-up question would be uh once you get elected you should be out obviously the public eye uh that means you know releasing your city email address everybody your phone number Hidden and out there do you have any problems with people calling you up or emailing you just you know what's going on you you can call me anytime you want if I'm in bed asleep my phone's off so nobody will ever bother me when I sleep but no I don't I put myself out there during that last election and probably a lot of people found out who I am through that and I was able to debate without ever getting ugly or personal of anyone which isn't always easy to do okay now that's a tough question anyone else right if you have a question you're a wolverine yes ma'am I I don't hate anybody not even a buckeye fan I promise we're brothers we're brothers and you know I have an older sister it's not always easy I love my sister but it isn't always easy to like her you know what I'm saying yeah [Music] okay I only have one um suppose that this is not uh an appointment situation and you're actually campaigning what would be the number one issue that you would live on any of your literature the very top issue and nothing else well the first thing is right right one thing I'm here to represent them you're not there for you you're there for us so that's what I would say sometimes you don't want what you what you would rather do is what everyone else would like and when we're a representative of people then we need to represent the will of the people thank you very much that's it thank you all right next up we have Mr Greer even three minutes to introduce yourself and uh switching through the same ruling process and I brought my own water good evening Mr mayor council staff and fellow residents my name is Grant Greer and I stand before you asking to be considered for the councilman replacement my background is business I have been an insurance executive for several decades and have spent my adult career in an industry building companies the careers of others and serving promote risk management through work with the state and National associations prior to something like my business interest in 2019 I was the CFO of an agency an insurance agency in St Louis had about 150 million in sales and about 100 employees in that role I learned the importance of team building and financial stewardship how to count on other team members that deal with them with respect and civility as president of the private company I learned the responsibility and hopefully the grace to that's required to serve those with whom I work and those to whom I'm accountable like the previous speaker my interest in this chamber came about a year and a half ago and my wife and I started attending meetings we love this community I think Kevin had a beard since I've been in here before I've picked this up sailing um and it seems like we turned the corner we love this community and I look forward to promoting a sense of civic pride both as a citizen and hopefully on this Council while I don't have any executive duties anymore I continue to manage some client relationships and serve as a director on three industry boards two of them nationally I also serve on the big eye flood insurance task force which is a committee of insurance Executives who deal with FEMA and Congress on legislative and coverage issues I know flood insurance is important to me I think it is to the rest of us in this room as well in the role as a director I have learned that what's required to provide guidance and Leadership to those who actually administer the day-to-day Affairs and and do the work of a city or any large organization for many years I served as a Planning and Zoning commissioner in the city of Collinsville Illinois for three years I served as chairman of that Commission in the course of that time I was a member of the many public meetings helped several public hearings and in that role like I learned that there's a very real importance to a comprehensive plan to governing documents and to being faithful to what the vision is of the city I've also learned that sometimes being understanding and open-minded is the best way to meet the needs and promote the well-being of our citizens Mr President and chairman of the Habitat for Humanity for two counties in Illinois I learned how to lead a Divergent group of opinions and interest together for a common and Noble good and in that role I learned that there's a sacred trust when you're dealing with public funds and that there is a need to have open and unimpeachable integrity my family's been visiting this area for over 35 years and in that time we fall in love with the community we've fallen in love with the beach I've fallen in love with sailing and we moved to Bellaire beach in 2017 we did live in Clearwater for a few years prior to that until I found the sanctum that I call Builder Beach we're both raised in small towns we have keen sense of civic duty and uh if if we're going in I will work tirelessly with you and alongside you to preserve and continue the amazing Spirit of this community notice about your application put down a uh that you have condos your home state so you're a permanent resident of that address but you also uh lease another property here in Baylor issue close friends as you know you just kind of followed us along with short-term rentals is a real problem with the second point for this community with that portfolio from being able to deal with legislation on short-term rentals for that color your position at all that's a that's a great question no no it would not um I do live in a condo I live in the three my wife and I live alone in a three bedroom three bathroom condo in the time that I have been a permanent resident of Bel Air Beach I've owned homes Tampa Bay a short-term rental in Indian Rocks Beach homes in Bel Air Beach and Clearwater um real estate has been pretty good to me I share the concerns of short-term rentals and no there was no conflict for me what sort I do believe I have a 90-day requirement here so yeah I want to make sure okay uh the second question was you said you worked with a flood insurance task force um then again I have problems sometimes with ethics and it may be in conflict is this a for-profit agency that you are working for the flood insurance cash Force no that's a great question so the um the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America is the largest trade group for independent agents in the country and they have a task force and we have a number of lobbyists and so I am a member of that task force and we interact I just got an email today asking for an interview with FEMA so they could terms about the program so if the non-paid position it's a Trade Organization are you a registered lobbyist for that I am not I'm not a registered but for logging for that bill so we we have paper on this dude okay because again that's the kind of a caution Mark for me if we start dealing with newer in a flooding area uh we might have to address flooding type items and unfortunately in California we really don't start Florida we really can't recuse yourself in the vote you just can't say um you know maybe you're involved in this I can't recuse from the vote I just want to make sure that you're really separate from that organization when you're up here to the point where you may not be participating with it anymore and well first of all I'm a I'm a director with the with that organization so the flood task force is a committing of um of independent Agents from across the country and so yeah if you I would I would certainly approach that with our legal counsel and ask them what they thought was a conflict of interest I represented insurance agents you're representing the agents and the companies not not the companies the the agents the agents but not the people that purchase the policy well that's that's the whole world of an independent agent is to represent the people that purchase the policies but with Flint insurance is federally backed insurance so it doesn't have anything to do with claims interpretation policy I appreciate the check who you're leaving but we're kind of performance I just wanted to check written at this stage I think it's appropriate for me to intervene in the dialogue and discourse on the matter illegal conflict under chapter 112 in the Florida ethics code concerns the continuary gain and loss and individual experiences based on policy decisions money up money down what he's described as an unpaid largely an unpaid position and even if it were paid the the tests applied to that mainly the size of the class test would make whatever interest held almost certainly insignificant below the one percent threshold required he's not talking about lobbying this specific any government any government advocacy is at the federal level nothing specific to this community it's not lobbying before the community in which his apartment where is he a lobbyists and all that's he's described it there's nothing in the ethics code that prevents you have from having strong policy positions on an issue and ascending to Public Service whether he has informed or strong convicted policies or positions on the best route forward for insurance Parks bike paths whatever it is that brings people to public service and think let me Begin by thanking all of the candidates and people interested because the process doesn't work without the people willing to step up based on their passions or at least open the Service I'm not hearing a jack of 112 issue that way prevent him from being part of the council as in as much as seems to be the thrust of the discussion at this point clear it up thank you very much may I add to that that um I I generate no revenue from the sale of flood insurance and in the revenue that's generated by any firms that I'm associated with so though I am licensed in the State of Florida but I sell no insurance in Florida so I would I would generate no Revenue whatsoever I have no more questions um Mr Greer um I don't think under 112 if there wasn't conflict you just you are allowed to accuse yourself still right if there is in fact you suggest you are able to refuse and I've not heard anything that would be defined as a frequently and recurring conflict I said he could not dispatch no and I appreciate are you uh working with British Chicago because he seems to be the only person it's really spearhead issue part of a flood insurance act from FEMA I don't know how many people are going to get dropped in my private this DM just happened in the last couple months it is um there are a number of issues with flood insurance the the new maps are a problem we had a congressman who was from my former State who wanted to privatize and I had several meetings with him pointing out that while there is probably Capital at least at that point in time in the market to privatize it if that was a long-term solution people in his district would be able to buy earthquake insurance which they cannot so it is it needs to be a federal backstop of the biggest thing we need to do is have a long-term solution the stuff of cake and began down the road for six months 12 months is without exposing your address it looks like you look out your back window or something or whatever you would call it you see the Gulf of Mexico I'm about 30 feet from it yeah what is your position on YouTube that we're not going to be getting assumes and where would you put your resources that you had a chance of hemi's Pinellas would you put it into underground lighting or would you put it in the beach regard well you know the beach is is a big attraction and so here would be an illustration of what's my personal View and what's and what's the community View this last hurricane with the beach I mean that's happened what it was six months ago and you know I am very concerned about Beach Marine Richmond and I'm concerned about our neighbors to the South and um look effect that's going to have on our ability to next time the reimbursement rolls around but I do believe that our public beaches are a large drama for um for our community so I think that's I think that's a big deal thank you any other questions just a follow-up to that um Miller Beach is a private beach um I want to say private but we have limited access so when you're speaking of public is a public draw we're not a tourist community explain yourself and when you say that uh well we do have we do have access for our residents the residents of Bellaire Beach we have Morgan Park we have a number of entrances and there anybody that has signed for renourishment is given amusement to allow access so yes I do recognize it and get frustrated sometimes when when I've got a lot of crowds outside outside my back patio but you know it's more than just those that of us that are fortunate enough to live on the bay ship everybody lives in Bel Air beach has access to the beach [Music] do you feel like the county has been doing enough uh to try to fight for our beaches so I anything any evidence that I have Mr mayor's ending building but um I would say no because what they've done doesn't seem to have been effective okay that's experience I don't have any other questions anyone else all right thank you very much Mr Greer next up Mr Harper that evening council members members of citizens of elevation my name is uh Todd Barker and I am applying for the position of Council position um Beller Beach is a really unique community and it's Unique in several ways number one being that it has no commercial interest and that raises issues and concerns for the council and for the city because effectively the city has to be self-funding so in going through what the council does and what the council has to look at not only do we have the unique aspect of having to be self-funding but we also have to be a community that is aware of flood and is aware of Beach and it's aware of all the unique issues of a Gulf Coast Community the members sitting on this council do not have an easy job it is a job that really requires teamwork it requires advocacy and requires communication I have been a engineer and a technologist for over 30 years I tend to be more of a problem solver I look at a problem I break it down and I try to analyze how to come to a resolution on a problem I see an opportunity for the council to take really good advantage of its boards and its committees not only to take the burden off of council but to get a diversity of opinions and a diversity of ideas I have sat on committees I have sat on Council I understand the challenges that it puts you through I understand the time commitments that it takes my advocacy is for the council and what it represents as a community but it also represents setting priorities setting a strategic plan so when you ask about where as a council I would see opportunity I see at the end Communications of the citizens I see them using and taking access to City resources such as the easements and the parks I see it as advocacy and opportunity for undergrounding I see adapters advocacy understanding for Peachtree nourishment so I see a lot of opportunities I see a lot of work but I think that I step up to play with experience from Council experience from being buying behind that desk and at the same time the opportunity to be an advocate and to be a proponent for the citizens look at that Council Mr Roberts so 18 and 19 were on the council yes so at that time so was that a two-year term then or a three-year term that was actually an internal term again okay so I stopped I stepped in after another council member left and stood into that position until the next election was there anything in particular with that when that Journey ended that to help you to decide not to run again I actually did run again Mr Gates and I were on the same ticket in fact um so no I did run and you know the citizens spoke for what they wanted at that that is what it is um but I'm stepping up with the opportunity to serve again and be here for the community I have since retired I grew up in the area I actually went to Seminole High School I actually went to USF and I've been in this community in this area for you know 45 years I've been a citizen and resident of Bellard each full-time since 2015. so I've been through the citizen side the council side the community side thank God for a wealth of opportunity and experience perfect so in that 18 and 19th term just thinking back so what was like one of what was the top issue that probably came across while you were on that Council the three big issues that happened in that Council session was undergrounding of the 22nd Street in NW state tree nourishment and City business what in regards to the cities there was a lot of discussion about encroachment on those easements and the idea that there was overgrowth and there wasn't really citizen access through all so there was a large effort put into place to survey those easements and make sure that the reporters don't markers to basically indicate where city property was and then from there to decide how to manage until season is moving forward thank you yes uh you're a member of the code of the code review what would be your number one regarding the code I mean what would you be their prairie town I think the biggest issue on code right now is really prioritizing the individual citizens there's a lot of talk and discussion when we originally did the code review which was dealing with Hedges and sizes and outbuildings and all a lot of the things that individual residents have concerned the original code review had as an example you could have an outsized building four feet high and 10 feet long and too wide so not a usable scenario so the code review can be really focused on the idea of making the code usable but making it more realistic and practical at the same time so when I look at code review at the present time it really comes down to enforcement I think we've got a good set of code but I think the idea of interpreting and the idea of utilizing the code of those extension is really where manager Kyle is going to have his hands full I'll ask you the same questions you're running again what's the number one issue on your ticket my number one issue is communication so when I look at the citizens and I look at how the city communicates with the citizens it's There's an opportunity for automation There's an opportunity for improvement um I think some of the communication Mrs Abel has been doing has been spectacular as far as just opening the door and having that level of communication but I think there's a great opportunity as I said earlier for the Committees and the boards to really Confluence what council does it makes them really wide perspective recommendations to the Council of how to move things forward and how to move things in place I think the other thing I find really intriguing is going to be the Bellar Beach Foundation I think that the council could do an awful lot with that foundation and have that support a lot of the back end projects that could be privately funded with the city's support so that's what one of the things I would look forward to seeing is how does this Foundation play and how can you work with to make it memorable part of what we do from a communication and engagement and a Citizens perspective yeah how would you spend the community foundations I think the Community Foundation should be partially involved or integrated with this advisor Council I think the idea that you could as an example I would love to see I talk about the easements a lot but I would love to see maybe maybe a citizen sponsorship of individual segments for the maintenance in the offloading of that extension that cost the pick up the trash on the beach days things like that I think there's a lot of different ways to consent and communicate and entice the citizens to get involved and the challenge of the council houses you know with as many people as we have that are not Homestead and not permanent residents communication becomes difficult and I think that you get into privacy issue so I think the whole way of the city interacts with with the citizens is a challenge at that and I think that's something that I think the Committees and I think some other leaders could help thank you very much Mr Harper thank you all right Alaska the influential Livingstone thank you for having me my name is Belinda Livingstone I'm a registered nurse by trade I do have my Master's in nursing a side note on leadership and management my background is you know I was only at the staff level for six months in my nursing career I immediately understood at that point that from a leadership perspective is where I needed to be in order to have the most effect on the members episode of our patients at the time so I've gone straight into leadership in my nursing career so going from director of case management director of quality risk management director of operations I'm a CEO at a hospital at one point in time and currently I'm an operations manager with oversight for care teams in four states my passion is looking at regulatory guidelines which is a little strange I love regulations and in the hospital environment there's not just one overarching regulatory body there are several so you have your federal regulations you have your credit money regulations your state regulations it's it's a Harmony in all the regulations and bringing it all together said I've served on various policy and procedure committees in my career currently I'm one of my current employer as well [Music] you know it's taking a look and how can we best serve what are the best practices what are life organizations doing to best serve their members I want to be able to do that for the city of Butler Beach I have served on boards in the past San Antonio I served on the Alamo chapter of the case management Society for several years as a reporting secretary most recently I've been nominated as president-elect for the Florida Chapter Waste Management Society of America have a strong passion for doing what's right for those that will serve thank you very much Council let's start with Mr broker the other day so you've been on the citizens advisory committee which is wonderful so what's what's one of the bigger things um you guys on that committee have had to tackle since you've been involved so with all due respect I've only been to one meeting and that's this last meeting we were talking about something that we're going to put forward probably in January so nothing to me at this point in time well thank you for volunteering and then your husband's name is Graham right that's correct okay so when I was campaigning he took the time and don't tell me that he didn't like me so he was very well but I had to take some points off okay thank you you're welcome yeah in the United States you can serve like today is a little bit different here I mean I found out too is you have at least two meetings a month you try aluminum to a relatively sane hours but that also means the time involved for prep work try to understand the issues dropping by I just want to make sure that you understand that you don't have anything that would interfere with making this your priority with you no I do not as a matter of fact I work from home so I am remote so I'm very flexible as far as my work schedule is concerned it's Monday for Friday but I do have the flexibility to to move around the hours as far as doing the lab work in the research that's definitely something that's a passion of mine and I completely understand that I've been willing to take that out because I'm having conflicts everybody's been talking about you if you're running or what what's your number one idea what do you want to accomplish oh okay you see me done here you know a lot can change in a year so it definitely lead by example do what's best show up in the community be it community events but you know a lot can change in a year as far as what the needs are for the community and what can be solved in that year what do you see right now I mean maybe one item that you want to look here as far as the need is concerned so yeah as far as the city you know they talk about you know the traffic issues yeah that's a huge issue but you know how can that be resolved I would not know without looking at the regulations without being familiar with them as far as that's concerned there was an accident in front of you know we were crossing Gulf Boulevard um we hit the button to go across and there was a big accident and we had to call 9-1-1 and my amazing husband you know helped care for that man until you know EMS arrived and I was trying to deal with traffic and you know it's a it's a it's a big problem I just think that you know we get more involved traffic is an issue but how do you resolve that I don't know okay the topic was brought up earlier about the easements there's a lot of controversy right now so I'm going to ask you to put yourself out there what would you do with it not everybody is affected by the easements you know walking around and doing the drop-offs it was very clear to see I think with it having the easements um taken care of and engaged and whatnot I think there's a lot of people with that I also think that there's a lot of resource that will have to go to providing extra security around that you know as far as the police force are concerned Etc so I don't I don't necessarily agree with with that per se but it depends on what everybody you know what the community wants but I don't believe that everybody's affected by those because it's not in on every every supporter thank you very much for your questions thank you very much I appreciate it okay now it's time for citizen Commons please remember that you are addressing the council not the candidates maybe you will be limited to three minutes not everyone speak at once okay so now we're back to the council the council will vote to determine who the council would like to appoint to be appointed an applicant Must Believe or receive no less than four votes from the council with no African proceeds for those we will take the top two applicants and vote again in the event of the time but less than a majority the council and outcomes may use an alternate method to decide the winner a good example is flipping a coin I'm hoping that this Council will do that too before we decide I'd like to thank each of you who apply for this position the volunteering shows that you truly hear about your city and I encourage each of you to seek other ways to serve if you are not already any other discussion from the council before we go um I guess this was I guess this was where Mr Moore um since ethics training and refreshing you have these trainings per calendar year we any candidate elected tonight have to go through that since we're down the lake the last four or five weeks off-handed on I don't believe so but I have to look at that if they did there's a devilishly handsome related attorney offering some online in about two weeks speak um but I I don't believe that to be the case but if it is required there are channels to do so a relatively painless approach given that it's still ethics treatment I just wanted to thank all four candidates when this opportunity of nailed itself I was curious to who and how many would actually you know want to want to jump in here and do this and I find myself now in a scenario where we have four very very good candidates I'm actually thinking about setting down myself um yeah I don't think there's uh there's not a loser here so obviously we have to select one person and this is very similar to months ago when we had to select between two uh legal firms and I felt at that time that neither one of each others was going to be a wonderful job for our city as I feel for you candidates we'll do one of the job for our city so thanks again for stepping up any other comments all right uh we have ballots are in our possession as for you to vote for one okay foreign to get them sorted um council member bankard voted for Ms Livingstone council member Notaro voted for Mr Chester councilmember Roberts voted for Ms Livingstone council members Abel voted for Mr Harper vice mayor Shirley voted for Mr Chester mayor Gaddis voted for Miss Livingston all right so we did not reach a majority of four for any candidate but the top two are Eastern Chester and Mr Livingstone so you should have a second ballot and uh that has the council to do is back off Mr Greer Mr Harper and a vote for Mr Chester or Mr Livingstone foreign foreign voted for Miss Livingstone council member Notaro voted for Mr Chester [Music] councilmember Roberts voted for Ms Livingstone council members Abel voted for
