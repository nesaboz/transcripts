[Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] um thank you Kyle Patty would you please call the roll council member Frank Banker council member Belinda Livingstone president council member Leslie Notaro council member Lloyd Roberts sure vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gattis here city manager Kyle riefler here so the attorney Randy Mora president and council member Mike Fable was unable to attend thank you Patty we'll just move right on to item number one which is discussion of the citizens advisory committee's recommendation for the storm water project bond issue this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefler thank you man so I'm happy to be bringing this to the meeting tonight uh citizens advisory committee has been working on her for months now um primarily the chair Ron saganic and me of and as well as Heather our Financial Consultant have been putting numbers together and working with uh some small Banks and Chris Rowe um who you know kind of organized the financials of of the loan that we're going to talk about tonight I'm going to start off by um talking about this first page which is a spreadsheet it's a you know you're gonna unfold it but it's uh hopefully you're able to see the numbers on there or try to make them big enough um and if you go to start on the left the projects you'll see this is the uh the next five years of well I should say two of the years work we're on the second year here but it's the Five Stone water storm water projects that are remaining in the master plan and if you look um it talks about the uh the project what streets it's on says the the year that it was funded so right now we're funded up to 17th and 18th 19th 20th and 9th um stormwater projects um that leaves the remaining starting next budget year would be 22nd 23rd the following uh Morgan and 25th and then uh fiscal year 2526 would be 14 through 16th um it breaks down as you can see the it has the BMP it has the uh 2022 estimated cost of the projects um the products have gone up with the estimated cost because uh we found out when the 12th and 13th Street project that it came out a little higher than estimated so there's uh you can see notes all the way over on the right uh assumptions notes and it talks about increase budget by 30 fiscal year 22-23 so all these numbers over here they had 2022 estimated costs that is a a multiplier of 1.3 times the last estimated cost which was done in uh 2019. so if you follow the budgeted for the BMP again if you get up to this year fiscal year 2223 where budgeted you know for the 17th 18th 19th 20th and 9th Street projects um we have money that's uh on a savings plan that it was projected for the next three projects but we don't have it in the budget yet the the resurfacing portion of the project so BMP is the actual stormwater you know digging up changing inlets uh replacing pipe uh injury from our Mass band what the engineer recommended the resurfacing portion the next one over is the coinciding streets to be re to be resurfaced while the Project's taking place so it lists per project the streets in the area what I tried to do is our street index um you'll see just below that where it says condition 100 point scale um and then ranked uh you know by total score of 100 um the worst streets is obviously the red zero to twenty and I tried to color code those were all having the index in front of us um the street listing with how the condition it's actually in so you'll see that a lot of these streets that coincide with the projects are you know covered from red to Yellow which is you know um pretty much the worst streets that are remaining in the city all these projects the streets that are Incorporated with them will um take us to resurfacing all the streets on the index that are um up to like the yellow condition the next one um on the index was a green condition which is fairly new it's in good shape for our scale so the resurfacing section is calculated out I ran it through a calculator that um has been very accurate um which I created about three years ago and it um it's been holding true to the to the estimated cost of what the research thing would cost um as part of the project so what I did is I calculated out the streets that are remaining to be resurfaced and did an estimated resurfacing cost for each one of those project years and then same thing for curbs when we were surface the streets we also change out the valley curb and I ran the numbers on estimations for the curve for those projects um bringing us all the way over to the total budget which kind of lays out everything with the uh the accumulated reserves um in the total project so um total project shortfall and that's basically because um even now when like when we look at like 17th 18th 19th 20th and 9th Street um the resurfacing cost of the project we actually do not do not have the total budget for so some of these are even falling short and you'll also notice that the 17th and 18th project that was saved for 336 before we increased the estimated Budget on each of the projects so we fall a little bit short there as well um so what we did is um ran all these numbers so this is the this is the total cost which I broke down on the bottom here you'll see you know still on a portion the resurfacing portion the curb portion and that gives you the total project costs minus what's already accumulated in the budget so it shows our current deficit of the total projects is about 2.8 million and um on the bottom here you have a table laid it out uh per fund so um show motor projects and the valley curb is part of the stormwater fund the street resurfacing is actually part of the capital project fund just to show the fun breakdown what's important to know here is that we still have the arpa money which was injected into the storm water fund but um it was brought up earlier I want to make clear that the uh when we talked about doing the underground project we talked about um the you know that money could make up that deficit that we had in the underground project so if that's how we how we applied it um I just want to make a note that I said the reserves to the reserves to Capital project fund for underground project will show in the CPS projections and that that's uh the next couple pages of how they're put together but um just the money is in the stormwater fund but just to be clear um if we're saying that money is going to the remainder what was left on the Underground project then um that eight eight hundred and two thousand will uh be transferred from the uh from reserves um to cover that part of the cost but either way that money will be spent um and in this case it'll be technically expand and uh and reimbursed from storm water but the budget all balances is what I'm trying to say so just want to make that clear um and then if you go to the next pages this is the projections that Heather ran for us um she kind of just broke down on the front here is sort of what I did in the table which shows the amounts in stormwater fund versus the capital project fund of our proposed uh loan that we're looking to acquire and then this is probably the furthest we've come um definitely in the most recent years of of laying out uh a projection of where where we're going um and it the general fund projections if you look at the top it shows us the um pretty much the reserves which sitting that's sitting there outside of the budget that we that we have accumulated and we broke it down into some separate buckets um to show um you have the unassigned which is is money that is just you know we've accumulated it's in accounts it's collecting interests but it is not assigned into anything in the budget so it's completely um outside of the budget the assigned capital projects we wanted to show what for the last budget what we allocated for uh future capital projects and that's what that represents um assigned for transfers that is you know what would have to transfer into another fund that current year and then the 20 Charter requirement that we just wanted to illustrate the number per Charter that is uh 20 of the operating expenses of the city and then through these projections you also see that we've kept the hurricane preparedness per resolution at a million dollars so that is actually that's not included in the unassigned reserves that is that is separate in these projections um and then you'll see this is a general fund um it's important to note that due to the undergrounding project you'll see our if you're looking at this current year we came up quite a bit and we're at about four million dollars we jump we fall back down a little bit because the injection into the undergrounding project but then you'll see after that um our unassigned funds continue to grow and a lot of this was done at a very conservative measures where um you know only predicted of one percent growth in revenues you can kind of see in a very small the percentages of what she projected and the expenses she did about three percent across the board except for a personnel which was the five percent um but using these projections you can see that we're pretty financially healthy as a city I'm gonna let uh chairperson Ron saganic go into the loan numbers a little bit great thanks Kyle and uh just to back up this all started when we were tasked back in October to see if we could do something with the billion dollar hurricane Reserve uh just to let you know when we talked to the banks the banks wanted a one and a half percent fee uh to put a 500 000 line together at a one and a half percent annual renewal fee and the legal was about 12 Grand so it just it didn't make sense to touch that cash and since part of the spirit was you could we take that maybe a half a million dollars of that cash and it accelerates some of these storm water projects um so I've been talking about the bank I asked where the rates at today this is back in October they're like four and a half percent and so we started working on this idea and uh today what I'll present to you is we've got two proposals from uh one from Valley Bank and one from South State so South state has done the last two Bond issues for the city the one for the Bellevue Estates undergrounding and the one for the storm water project uh if I'll uh I've retired for Bali so uh Valley did not have a municipal division when I worked there but they do now and so just so I give you that disclosure I don't work for them I don't get paid by them but um I honestly think the South state is a better deal as you'll look so there's an analysis that I prepared it's called city of Bel-Air Beach bod comparison that you should have where I side by side put the two loads so from what Kyle had talked about we're looking at a little over 2.1 million dollar shortfall in funding and so these are a 10-year facility uh cell state is it four point three six percent values at 4.5 percent uh they both have uh no prepay as well because it's paid off through cash flow uh South state would have a one percent penalty this has kind of been important to me because of the existing prepayment penalty on this particular facility uh the 2006 bond issue we did look at potentially to roll the balance of this load in and just consolidate everything but Chris Rowe who's our bond Council noted that we would lose the tax free uh status if we refinance it already Finance tax-free loan balance so that's why we've got three years left of payments that is detailed in the budget that Heather did and uh so this is just strictly for the storm water and the Kirby and the the roads resurfacing legal fees was a pretty big difference uh South state was a 3000 versus 7 500. an anti-dilution test that is basically a debt service coverage ratio and we have that on the existing truest on of 1.25 times and if you if you want to skip to the what's the back of this presentation there is a anti-dilution test that was prepared by Chris Rowe we we test out it four types 4.03 percent so what does that mean that means uh it so what we are pledging is our Dodd at velor of Revenue it's that ad form it's the non-advolar revenue so we generated last year almost 1.8 million to not at the lower revenue and so when you take our 445 000 in debt service that's four times so we're very strong uh to give some perspective at the interest rates we're talking the city could borrow 11.5 billion would still be compliant just to give you some scope uh what was interesting is the banks started throwing out deposit requirements and I I failed to change uh by sheet the deposit required by South state was initially five hundred thousand dollars after the citizens advisory Council got together the term sheet that you have I requested them to lower to 250 000 which they agreed to do uh the good news is we can put that the depository account we could take the Hurricane fund or just any kind of Buddy uh that is in the uh Reserves at Target therefore there's no Branch nearby the closest branches that Eden and so from a day-to-day operating it doesn't make any sense uh but if you you'll see the deposit rates that they're paid uh it's the opposite of deposit rates versus the loan rates so South States at 408. and what company is effective fed funds so effective fed funds today is 4.58 minus 50 basis points so 408 is what they pay Valley is paying Target fed funds which is 475 minus 50. so Valley's paying for a quarter and just so you know there's a lot of turmoil about Banks uh this last week in the State of Florida banks are required to collateralize these uh deposits public funds are required to be collateralized so they're super safe it doesn't matter to the bank and both of these banks are very conservative uh so so interesting point is if we could put the load with South State move the deposit relationship from truest to Valley and and basically If the Fed raises rates a half a point or a quarter point this week we're going to be earning an interest on our deposits which are almost two and a half times what we're borrowing equal the interest rate to what we're paying just from a perspective I did some other costs of the bot so the interest expense uh if you ran it to maturity the legal fees and the the uh the final bobbed about so you know what we projected was the 2 billion 73 354 that we have broad Council fees that uh you know part of issuing a bond is that we are required to have our city uh attorney his form to provide a legal opinion and so uh that legal opinion fee is what was uh calculated in the original contract uh that we have at the bank legal fee so you get the total that you bought needed the fund to close these two billion 107 479 or 2 billion what what nine seventy nine but really the difference is the bank's legal fees in that so what what does this do for the city of bower Beach first of all the residents uh benefit from getting their store module water projects accelerated you will participate at least a 250 000 it's savings on the uh mobilization fees we estimate there'll be about a half a billion dollars of mobilization fees if we're doing these in annual chunks so that 250 would be a pretty dramatic savings combined with the interest on the cash reserves uh to be equal or higher than the bond interest expense uh you making interest expense you're negligible if any and then also you know Heather did a great job with the projections and if you look out where on the general fund we'll be back to over six billion dollars yeah the uh 2526 uh at 26 27 fiscal years you know I ran some math that if we go ahead and prepaid a billion dollars and it just kept the payments going this load would be paid off in five and a half years with the total interest expense of 342 623. and what we didn't calculate in here is the savings on materials and labor by getting it all done today uh versus spreading it out over the next three to four years so it puts more uh you guys have copies of the actual term sheets uh I did adversation schedules so I'll be open to questions Council yes yeah I think that was great I think they'll there'll be an added benefit as well my guess would be that because this is a larger project and I know we can't really necessarily put a number to that but we'll probably have larger firms bid on these projects uh that will probably bid better pricing more competition I think that's going to be in addition but I realize we can't really put a number to that but I think we're going to see that benefit as well others are we going to be doing uh multiple streets at one time because we're saving on mobilization you said so we still figure this project is going to take place in about 120 days maybe 150 for based on the size but uh we still imagine that they're gonna work from one section to the next so it'll be over multiple streets because when they do the paving and things they're going to want to bring them in and do it all at once how much money did we get for pennies for Pinellas for undergrounding for underground I don't know it's like 902 uh if I remember right it was like 902 000 two years so a million eight million eight no yeah that's what's remaining but we uh I'd have to actually and we had money still coming to it uh let me pull it up for you so with the budget that has a prepared what it's all said and done about three years from now we get a final you okay what we thought it so this current budget um the total we got for penny four is a four million 123. 4 million total yeah so this um prior year funding up to um before this budget it was 1.3 million we got another 9 30 930 000 this year and then we have another 930 000 next year in the following year where what am I missing here if we would have took two million of that and put it into our infrastructure why would we need a bond yeah the penny money yeah any money has to be used towards underground yes well it that's that's the way we allocated but not the way the blueprint for the uh pennies for Pinellas County yeah penny for Pinellas County emphasized stormwater projects that's the first thing they really pushed for this Council before I sat on it started using that money for underground so I think part of it is um just to be clear as as a good portion of that I'm not going to say half of it but probably 40 percent comes from Bel Air Shores a portion of that company what I'm saying is we're collecting four million dollars total and we're having a deficit and what really really scares me is our deficit right now is 2.8 and there's been talk that we're going to use this art money which is 802 thousand dollars pull that out so now we're going to be at a 3.6 million or 3.7 million dollar deficit no we didn't say we were pulling that out I don't think that's ever well that's been talked so so the penny for money that um that four million um that's dedicated completely for undergrounding but each year we get um Capital revenue for um paying for Pinellas money so that that comes in each year um this past year was 170 000. so it's not as much so I understand but what you're saying if I wasn't on Council I've objected to this undergrounding I think stormwater projects are essential to the city it's right in our strategic plan it's a it's one of our goals [Applause] um and to put this city in Hawk which I'm going to vote for because it needs to be done but I this is how big government starts taking over when he just said where it can go with 11 million dollars and still would be in the good I just hope we have a little bit of foresight in the future when we have money given to us we use it for what it's supposed to be used now correct me if I'm wrong but the uh there there's just a small portion of the pennies for Pinellas money that was allocated specifically for Gulf Boulevard beautification is that right so like I said last year we got 170 000 Revenue but if you look at the penny 4 project reimbursement program um each year we're getting 930 000. that specifically has to be beautification yeah because that's how the agreement was signed which would have paid for this project we could not before all of our time I mean it was something that was agreed to years ago this is not something any of us had any and this is every Community up and down the beach it isn't just us yeah yeah it was agreed yeah anyone that fronts Golf Boulevard basically um so just I have a question because I can't quite put my finger on it what are we collecting in the stormwater fee what's the revenues of that currently it's I believe 175. annually 175 000. yes and um that was from what I would call this yeah 175. the uh you know starting assessment we wanted to look at it um in the future to reassess I'm just looking at that compared to The Debt Service on this no I think when Heather did the projections she did a one percent increase on that um which is not very significant but I'm just so you know let's see so I went from stormwater went from uh 175 this year and she put a 176 750 178 so there's a small increase that she built in one percent um in I guess a projection of like in the next four years we're probably going to raise it somewhat slightly yeah so when I'm looking at that I mean we nearly you know it's about 50 of debt Debt Service annually we're collecting stormwater fees but historically the city's funded storm water projects out of the general fund yeah I know and I'm just going and compared to when we started this stormwater project the entire budget was 4.5 million dollars here we are how many streets have we gotten done and we're still at 3.8 million because of the increase in costs right so it just makes complete sense I mean I I don't it's kind of a no-brainer and and that's one of the reasons we're here today because we we were afraid that this would happen if we didn't do something um I uh I think you did a great job of researching this and providing us with all these numbers and we have other questions from the council has all the engineering been done for all these streets so they're it's shuttle ready so the master plan was preliminary engineering so we'll still have design have we ever addressed doing this thing the right way because people in Council have said well people see their streets ripped up and then we get a heavy rain and there's flooding right after the stormwater the new stormwater pipes have been installed so have we ever addressed putting catch basins pumps in with the engineers because I would like to bring them in and see what the total cost of that would be to get because if you do it right you probably would get rid of a cat 2 storm here so to my knowledge nothing has been uh put together as a proposal from an engineer for that idea I do remember with after the seventh and 8th Street project you bring it up yeah so you know we could get some numbers and we still have flooding down on Third Street and that when high tides in it there I'm gonna ever fix some of this stuff but it certainly would make sense that when you talk to Engineers maybe Mr Banker can get involved and ask his questions in every street is going to be a case-by-case situation but uh there's certainly nothing wrong with asking uh while they're while they're doing their surveys and and planning if it's feasible to look into some type of a collection or a pump system thank you yes Mr Roberts I think another benefit that's that's been identified here is that you know Frank so if we have some extra monies available at the end you know we can accelerate the repayment five and a half years so we don't have to wait the full 10-year term which I think is great that that's in there because that's not always in bonds or loans so it's great that that's there so that if we have some money available we can say okay we're paying this baby off and there's a substantial amount of money that can be saved from an interest standpoint for the city which is great well this building gets paid off when next year no three years three years yeah other questions or comments just one quick question so the Ninth Street BMP does that include the the lack of a better term the tree streets the Cedar and the palm s it's resurfacing and uh the ballet curb would be the only Stillwater component of those three streets okay where they're initially identified storm water issues with those streets I'd have to look back at the report those in 2017 but um we did do the dredging of the retention Pond right that did assist with uh the water that comes off of spruce and Cedar okay so that's probably something I think we want to take a look at and just not address their issues because I have talked with some people there there are issues with the Retention Ponds and the fact that we don't have a a storm water pipe there where we can actually put the valve system to prevent backflow things like that but maybe there is something we can do there to actually put a storm water pipe there to prevent the backflow from the bay coming coming into those areas something like that so we can identify that like we talked about earlier when we talk with the engineers okay what's next [Music] my my goal if I were on board I was going to bring it to the next council meeting let's do it yeah it's just a sidebar Chris Rowe will be ready to be here on the April 3rd meeting he'll have the documents ready this rate is good till April 7th sorry that it seems like there's a a fire drill but I'm sure rates have pulled back a little bit so I'm sure this rate would still be the same if we wanted to but come away we're fast tracking this it's fast track to you all uh it's been over six months that we've been working on it just it's taking time to get things done but you know the chain of events will be Chris would be here uh there'd be a uh approval of the in uh city council meeting the first meeting in April and then they'll have the documents already for uh the you all decide and then uh the bank can fund it later in the week all right well let's find out then uh let's uh let's see what the general consensus is I'll start with vice mayor Shirley I say we move forward I'm in complete support this Livingstone I'm in agreement Mr Banker move forward Mr Roberts move forward as well Miss Montero yes and I also agree so uh let's go ahead and get it on the agenda and uh put it up for a vote at the next council meeting okay thank you can everyone hear me I feel like I'm not speaking very loud but the uh the pollen has gotten to my voice right we are on to item number two discussion on Triton diesel generator for the community center this is placed on the agenda by council member Roberts yes um city manager uh riefler and I had a couple conversations and we came to the conclusion so I'd be a good thing to go ahead and put this on the workshop agenda I think Kyle has done a great job in evaluating other opportunities out there I know initially we had funded how much was it called 250 000.50 yes for a new generator so I know he's done a lot of due diligence out there taking a look at other available options this particular one is a used diesel generator So currently this time I know you've looked into it a lot you've how do you feel about this particular option from what you've looked into so far I I think after the discussion we were kind of um caught up on the fact that we wanted natural gas but when we were looking for a more economical option we and we realized that you know we can get a fueling company to fuel a diesel generator um and also save on costs with a portable option I feel like we've kind of worked about as best it's going to get a bit but I think it's much better than what we were looking at because the uh we budgeted the 250 which at the time a generator was um you know somewhere like about 220 and then uh we got that recent Source well quote that was I think putting up like 280 it was it climbed quite a bit and this particular used option is the the number we received so far as well yeah this is uh this is off of a I believe a source well cooler as well um and we're at the 97 thousand price point and that would be that includes the you know the tank and the trailer but this is this this option would be to hook directly into the connection points that uh preview previously exists was the transfer switch there was um one other option that we kind of just got um discussed um at least I did with the sales um and I I believe it was about 132 and that was if you were going to put additional um connection points over in the parking lot um the benefits of that would it would get you a couple feet of elevation as opposed to being over here but you know get if we're looking at that kind of flooding I don't know I mean if we just got way out the situation if it really makes up much of a difference because we're we're gonna We're not gonna be here for the time period right and we'll tow the generator over the blower Beller Bluffs to keep it operable until you know the water is down if we're worried about flooding coming up on the building okay so this particular generator will provide us complete power to the entire building or portions of the building um so it was a the original design was the 100 kilowatt generator to to run basically what we calculated the power demands for the building that was with some cushion this is 88 which is on the three phase so [Music] um I mean I can have a our engineer kind of look at it but this is this was enough to do the whole building um because you know at the height at the highest demand summer time AC is running and everything you know we we were able to calculate that it would be conservative to have a 100 kilowatt would run it perfect and so if the diesel tank is completely full I know you had uh got an answer for me on that how long would that last so the tank itself is 680 liters of diesel and the you know in the features this is sub base tank up to 45 hours but if you calculate the um the consumption of liters per hour um if you're running a full load which would be that 88 kilo kilowatts yeah you're going to get about 38.5 hours if you're running a 75 you're going to get closer to 49.27 hours so okay depending on what you're running at you're going to get longer so uh you know if we're in a state where we're just running you know we're using this as an EOC and we're running you know the AC on that side and um you know internet connection Communications is not going to be as much as if we had this you know all the units for this room running for using it as some kind of uh shelter or pods After the Storm one thing we may want to pursue and maybe we've already addressed this is that the diesel providers out there I know from past experience we can make contracts with them because if we have a catastrophe in the area oftentimes you could be on the short list and if we run out of diesel fuel nobody's able to provide because there are contracts you can put in place so that we're at the top and so when we say hey we need some fuel we'll be able to get it sometimes you pay a little bit of an additional fee up front for that but obviously in an emergency situation it's it's worth that sure so there may be something to take a look at just so we're we're basically guaranteeing so you pay a premium for a guarantee right that if we need diesel fuel we're at the top of the list or close to the top so we're going to get that percent of a deal so that's something we can look into just to make sure because obviously the worst case scenario we have a catastrophic Storm come through our our initial allowance in our tank runs out and then we say hey we need some more diesel and they're like sorry and it's of no value at that point right but uh there are contracts we can put in place to assist us in that area I think so great job on this because I think this this saved the city a lot of money and I think it's going to provide the solution we need there's obviously exercising of the diesel generators that we need to do on a weekly basis or a bi-weekly basis to make sure it continues to run so that we do need it it's ready to roll Kyle um is there an option for a larger tank I haven't asked uh I can check because I I don't believe 45 hours is of enough protection um whenever Irma came through there were places that were down for 10 days without power obviously we're on a we're on the main line but um still something I would like for you to look into you can get a breeder tank on there above ground tank are you gonna I mean it's right on the basis and so and then the entire apparatus is on a trailer correct there is there you didn't find out first of all how many hours are on this one you know about 40 running full bar no I mean how many hours um it's uh there you know it's got a one-year warranty on it you can do a warranty extensions which isn't too bad it's a used generators or two thousand hours a thousand hours 500. I can find out I'm not sure um I'll find out the only other problem I have is John Deere is a good piece of equipment when you use diesel fuel and you store diesel fuel especially in this climate you get a lot of algae in that tank and bang when they get into the filters you're not going to get nothing but problems um I might have a supply of them I might have a supply of those but anyway yeah well you can put all the items you want but absolutely I've seen tanks just totally can get contaminated um but you're you've got a maintenance contract on this right yeah there's uh maintenance contract options you can send them up to five years which should be really and a lot of these maintenance contracts don't test for algae and that should be one of our sources because there's nothing worse than starting a generator up running it for five hours and it goes the whole time but good job any other questions or comments on this you answered my question about the um you know it has a one year warranty on and I'm assuming it's tied into the quarterly maintenance agreement that lasts for a year and you said that there's an option to purchase additional maintenance on that yes so um maybe looking at the cost associated with that additional maintenance as well I don't see it on here I just see the general for the one year I believe it was like a two-year Edition uh was about 3 000 and then you could get up to five additional years and I think that was around five of the six thousand so it was reasonable okay all right perfect thank you that's what I'm saying that's about a couple of questions too if this is uh mobile I'm going to assume that it will be it will sit in place and have a continuous connection to our system and we'll have a schedule where it starts on its own and and well I'm part of the maintenance contract don't come and they'll start it okay and uh you know make sure it runs and test it um and then that's really up to us if we want to keep it it would be back in that corner over there um I think the last one they might have kept there most of the time before um but we also could trailer it behind the building you know if we didn't want it out there all the time but I think she's wondering is it going to be an automatic start because this thing will have a pigtail that you're gonna have to plug in most of them do like most of the commercial ones I see they will come on every whatever Monday morning at 10 o'clock and they run for an hour and shut off okay I don't let me check on that I don't know I don't think because you'd have to have a whole integrated circuit for that well and I think it has to be permanently connected yes uh for it to run through which it's normal charge cycle and all of that horse comes on I want to say ours starts uh we have one similar to this at uh at the office and I believe it comes on about three times a week yeah it fires up annoys people for a few minutes and then shuts back down but I get uh notifications every time it happens and uh so it it may be something worth looking into but the question is is how do you connect it from this building to wherever you want to put it [Music] hook them up all right well let's let's find out what that that uh are we on any uh sort of a deadline right now a timeline on this offer I want to say like uh 30 days so we're pretty much coming up on it again I can check on where we're at it says quote expires 15 days from issue date and the date being January 26th so okay through this page oh labor prices and quotes okay that's just affordable is what is that what we're comparing to is that what your other quote was for a portable generator like this or was that a generator installed on it on a stand yeah permanently mounted and attached and that was natural gas also correct yes so we can kind of think about what we're comparing to you know that's something to think about and we have natural gas here at the building right we do uh it's it's a an expensive price for convenience it's a big night and day difference in in cost so that's something else that we should consider also um there's always a possibility that something could happen to it while it's being transported I thought it's moving this thing to Higher Grounds or would it make sense to have a you know kind of like you would a truck well uh RAM a truck ramp ramp it up and just you know keep it elevated on site and then you start adding costs like that then does it make sense to have a portable one I don't know I'm just just thinking it through and just some of the thoughts that I'm having so I don't I it's and this quote is expired now is that correct is that what I just what I heard yes okay so we'd have to do a Rec a re-quote anyway um and whenever you're you consider portable the only option is diesel oh okay I do have one more question um so this building is running on generator power and people are returning back uh will the doors be open to the public to come in here and get some relief from the heat during the day yes will we would we provide uh drinking water uh things like that we'd have to stockpile water but if we could get it um transported in as part of uh from the county and from the state yeah we could we can have it in here but Our intention was to when we opened this back up to to run AC and have a cooling pod for residents well we're providing information on inspections permitting um loans all that stuff after a storm right okay and that's the only only uh it's the only way that I would vote to approve something like this would be that uh it didn't just benefit the office it actually benefited everyone Mr Roberts we had asked about a time frame so obviously June 1st is rapidly approaching with the hurricane season so it would be nice if it's even possible do you think it's possible at this point Kyle that we could actually have the generator sitting out there prior to June 1st then I gotta verify because when we saw what happened with the playground I mean annual supply issues I'd have to check I haven't gotten to that point because it would be something that would be nice if in fact we could absent out there prior to June 1st and say okay we've done our due diligence we've got a generator there and of course you know June 1st is the official date for the hurricane season that doesn't mean a hurricane doesn't come through on May the 15th but um that that might be a good thing to have in place if we had that there and let's say June the 15th we had a major hurricane come through and we lost power for 10 days and we had a generator in place to power this building that would look good and be effective well considering that this quote is is already expired you're going to have to get a recruit anywhere and we don't know what the actual cost will be I'm I'm assuming that the way things are going it's probably five percent more at least than what this quote currently States um I I would also I I still would like the council to have both options to look at uh permanently mounted whatever that is versus this portable generator I know that this is much cheaper and I'm not in the mood to spend a whole lot of money but at the same time we want what's best for this building this city and on our citizens um you're going to have to get a re-quote anyway I would like to ask you to get both types of quotes that we can look at one one last time because whether you're getting one or getting two I'm assuming it'll be about the same time frame yeah Council I agree I'd like to see it side by side and I know it's unusual to have that at a council meeting but could we just maybe have it for the council meeting if you have if you get it in by then I'll try to yeah not that we can really discuss much but at least we have the information and but we can uh certainly discuss whatever you'd like during the city manager's comments sure okay what would the process be if he comes back with a quote next month we had to run this through the public twice the purchases or can we just purchase that right off I don't think it requires doing anything but just uh approval voting on it yeah during a regular council meeting good the two reading requirement is with ordinances there'd be no ordinance associated with this as long as it's within the purchasing guidelines of the of the city um as long as I didn't know if there was a threshold of the money value I would of course look to Kyle and work with Kyle and make sure that we've checked that but ordinarily there's no statutory requirement of thankful earrings now if you're able to get quotes before the meeting that would be even better and that way we would have them in our hands and we could look at as soon as I kind of way around that way uh any other questions or comments on this topic there may be somebody Kyle with the state of Florida I don't know what that title would be but somebody has to be in charge for the State of Florida with regards to all the assets and and there are times where they will actually make things like generators available where they've replaced them and they'll look upon a smaller City like Belair Beach and say would you guys like to have this that's a possibility um so the first step obviously would be to find out who that contact person is for the state and they have obviously a tremendous amount of generators out there that they use for their buildings permanent installations as well as portable generators so there may be something available out there for somebody like our city that we could actually get get I don't know about this state but most States like where I'm from Jersey Pennsylvania Delaware they're they're mostly at least a lot like Caterpillar or whatever like that so when they're removed cat takes them back John Deere takes them back Cummins takes them back and then they go in the market for sale are you saying this state has an allocation that they purchased the whole generator outright yeah I know if it's Swift Mud we had quite a few and they were purchased yeah yeah so what did they do with them they just gave them away or sold it sometimes if they were going to upgrade they would trade in just like you would a car but other times they may just make them available to somebody who may be interested in them good anything else nope all right well let's move on to item number three discussion to increase fines for parking violations placed on the agenda by city manager reefer thank you mayor um our community services administrator put together this uh local listing of the fines in the area so we focused on what the initial parking violation for uh overtime parking would be which is you know if you don't pay the meter um and then what the uh if there's any additional charges after so many days a late charge or whatever so we compiled it together um and uh just wanted to lay it out so you guys could have a good look at um just kind of what the surrounding cities are doing um you know one thing that jumped out at me is uh like like Indian Shores you know they got a 50 um initial fine and then if you can see most of these most of these municipalities they double um Their fines after 15 days some don't but most do um and it's also interesting to note like um some of the the cities that have their own police department they use the district court that's established um in court if there's any additional fees okay so what are you looking for there Mr reefer um so we we did a resolution to raise the rates on the meters um I'm looking uh because if we if we raise our meter rates and keep a 35 ticket we might you know we may not get people paying the rates not when it's cheaper than paying the meter all day so if something was brought up to consider raising the parking tickets and I wanted uh to present just kind of what what we're looking at oh yeah before we did so well let me ask you this um who's going to enforce this yeah who's who's going to I mean to right now it's my understanding that we rarely ever tickets are rarely ever written for parking is that true or most tickets are written uh on a night shift by one of the deputies because the majority of the tickets but we don't um maybe two to three a shift that's every day most days yeah all right and that's the weekends a little bit the weekend gives you a little bit more tickets because you adjusted the volume is that partly just in this area or you're talking about Morgan Park and everything that would be Morgan mainly Morgan but Morgan Marina City Hall in Bayside okay and uh what about parking illegally on the street how often are tickets written for that um I'd have to check that okay okay and the reason why I ask is because it happens all the time and uh if we're going to um if we're going to raise the rates and we're going to try to enforce this um we don't want to make it cheaper to park in the street illegally and uh and so whatever we do we probably need to do it Citywide I would think well that does bring a good question though do we ticket do we mostly if it's ticketed on the street it's for someone fishing or something like that like I know for instance someone that got a ticket fishing off of one of the piers that wasn't a city resident you know they not for fishing on the pier but for parking their car in the street right next to the sign that says no parking city-wide right so it's a young guy you know but uh um so you know do residents I guess my question is is it often that residents have guests and they get uh the guest get ticketed or because I don't know if we're opening a can of worms I agree we need to jack these rates up because clearly someone's gonna I'd rather pay the 35 fine and worry about feeding the meter I mean cheaper than parking down about down at Clearwater Beach made the 35 fine right exactly what are you going to do you're going to pay ten dollars for three hours or 35 dollars for all day right right yeah I am thinking that we're the hundred dollar we're the hundred dollar fine yeah I just don't want a resident's guest to get a hundred dollar fine you know that's what I'm I I'm concerned about I guess would you say the hundred dollars straight up first for for meter uh not feeding the meter not paying your uh parking fee and uh while we can certainly have that discussion I would just like the opportunity to research our ability to do so um as you look at the um the hot the highest on that chart is 75 dollars the mean median and mode tend to track closer to 30 to 35 there is some statutory Authority as you look at Florida statute um 318.18 and and others that might suggest that number needs to track closer to 30. um I would of course um you know I would look at that I think that looking at that number um the the fact that there is no outlier there in this community suggests most of the communities track towards that statutory language I'm not telling you you won't find a community in Florida that finds that I I don't know if they've been you know if they've had legal analysis done it or challenged it but I don't I I owe it to you as my client to raise that if we go as high as 100 if there is a challenge to be had your invite it I'm not saying that there certainly is I'd like an opportunity to analyze that a little more closely it's been the last I looked at that meaningfully was about uh three years ago obviously a lot happened session to session I'd like to make sure that that Authority is current would you also um make a recommendation whenever you come back with those answers absolutely sir um I I won't recommend a precise amount but I'll always recommend what I think is maybe a suitable range yeah a range that you may wish to consider but well IRB 75 right but they see you see they have no late charges yeah but every other Beach Community is at least 50. is that is that the caveat here if you don't have any late charges well I don't know I see 60 at Madeira right with an additional 30 if they're 14 days late is that the thing if you have it well I'm not saying that at all and please understand that when I give advice advice may not always bind action um I I would give you advice and you folks can decide for yourselves what you what your willing to to move forward and do but I I owe it to you as you work shopping this to raise there's a reason there's likely a reason why you're not seeing that because I'm sure you as legislators and community members are not the only ones who you know I I've said somewhat ingest to some of you in other contexts that anything that's punishable by a fine is legal for a price right um and so there's that that notion um and so I understand what you're trying to address um but I I owe it to you to just make sure that that issue is discussed so um uh going back to vice mayor Shirley's questions about okay I have guessed and now they're getting a hundred dollar ticket for parking in front of my home um I think that that situation is is a little hard to address and the reason why is because you've never really know what what situation is going to crop up I've never seen it an issue but I'm asking do we know how many tickets have been issued in that circumstance typically a deputy will do a warning um they will take it for on-three parking if it's a repeat offense but most deputies are they air to the side of Education versus okay I think there's also a provision that you know if you're having a party or something you can call and say I'm going to have six people parked on right you know 22nd Street in front of my house you know they stay on one side of the street because I know we've done that from the condos if there's going to be a huge group call and say tell everybody to park on this street so it can't you can do it without a ticket you just have to shall I say plan ahead I know there's a lot of on-street parking on my street and no one gets ticketed but I'm just asking because I don't want it to be to bite us later as being a problem you know so I and I've never had an issue I'm just want to make sure that we're not creating a future problems I've never had that problem either but however I will add that I uh have driven down 22nd Street many times and there's a car parked illegally right next to the bridge and you can lower your window and even warn them go in the house for a few minutes turn around and come back they don't care they don't care they're still doing the same thing these are these this is what I would like to address because it is a problem you go to other communities around us even over in Bel Air and because they allow parking in the street two cars one on each side you can barely get through and I moved away from that I moved away from Seminole for that very reason well then because I like water but uh um I that's the last thing I want to see is just more and more cars coming into the community and just parking all over the place um I think maybe if the council agrees with me maybe what we should do rather than having Randy reply back to us first off are we all in agreement that we would like a much higher uh much higher fine and do we have some sort of a cap or am I just uh do I sound awful by saying a hundred dollars I was going to say 250. and there's no additional flying that would appease well and and the reason why I'm saying this is because uh what I'd like to do is is Task Randy to uh to work with uh city manager reefler and then he just gave us something to vote on whenever we come back but I want to know if there's if there's a specific tab that we do not want him to go hire that I'm going to say if we use this guide no lower than 50 and no higher than 75 and then you can add some penalties you know after 15 days like they've done you know but but I think to be to say hey we've done our research and this is what all the surrounding communities are doing and if you look at the beach communities they're all in that range okay that sounds good I'm fine with that and and I think that we can see how it impacts uh the problem uh go ahead Mr Roberts yeah Kyle just a couple quick questions so let's just take the marina for example or Morgan Street how how do we identify with the current parking system that we have that somebody has not put enough money in currently expired currently have to walk around to the front of the vehicle look in the on the dash and see a ticket this is the time that they can park till okay so I'm sorry to tell them right then that at 1 15 PM it's done and it's now two o'clock so they'll do a ticket right okay how much of that whatever we decide on how much of that ticket money goes to the city all of it all of it the way the current system works which is our own tickets okay yes and if with the new system that we're getting ready to implement do we know how easily that's visible to a deputy that they've expired their time the new system is going to be a lot easier for the deputy because they're going to be able to pull listing of paid plates as they enter the parking lot so they'll be able to just cross check a plate perfect so they'll have access to the automated system yes to say Okay small seven and nine have expired perfect it's great okay and so then they could write them a ticket at that point for for x amount and and we're good okay and we did agree to 100 pull the old meters out right okay yes and the one thing I'll just add for context um and I'm not saying this is across the board in my limited experience from an administrative standpoint where you see that change in rate past day 15 is the if you come and pay it in house in date within day 15 fine we don't really have a lot of administrative costs added to that after day 15 we're sending it to local ordinance violation court now there's administrative charges they're processing it and you're you're one you're getting less capture on that um but two there are additional administrative charges associated with that being prosecuted pursued otherwise or just simply processed is this why they have the uh after 15 days that's yeah that's what I'm gonna that's why some communities have after 15 days it's and that depends on that Community their ability to manage such a process administratively bureaucratically however you wish to describe it but it's if you even get to our Clerk or somebody or our system if you have it online by day 15 fine pay the 50 bucks but then day 15 now we're sending it over to the court they're going to charge us a filing fee and all these things and so you know the rate changes and so that's my experience that has been my experience in other communities I can't say unequivocally everyone does well it's interesting because Clearwater says 23 added to the total ticket including the late fee so that's the administrative fee probably we currently don't send it to court we send it to a collection a collection it's agency yeah I didn't mean to speak to everyone some cities give you a discount if you actually come and pay the dis the clerk for example Kansas City 50 bucks you come in directly and pay the city clerk give us 23 we're good give anything shorts yeah as we're parking the street so that's interesting Readington Shore same thing yeah exactly the same thing they copied them so Monday morning pay the clerk twenty three dollars and you'll see some of these cities don't actually have metered so if that's their parking ticket for other violations okay so yeah I would think that just to simplify things the fine would double after so many days and then stop and in that way it covers all of the Pia that goes along with having to administer this Randy thoughts no none further mayor I mean okay doubling at after 15 days um and then just halting does that sound reasonable uh that's typically how it operates there's no it's not it doesn't accumulate thereafter it's not like a daily code enforcement fine that compounds typically it's flat amount at this point flat amount at that point and then and then I know and then it's just handled either it's ignored or it's paid but it's handled yeah all right uh if everyone agrees uh please um add something make it an agenda item and give us something to vote on and we'll determine then if we're moving forward with it okay just a follow-up for the uh Park Mobile um the contract's been signed they're supposed to assign a project team to install you know the signage and get us up and running I'm going to follow back up with them to find what the timeline is for that um So currently um we just um finished that finalize that resolution I'm not sure if you signed it tonight for the actual uh the meter ink the rate increase but depending on the timeline uh just because if we're going to uh raise the rates on the current machines there's a program programming fee charge um that if if it's a matter of weeks and you know don't want to pay I understand um okay and did you put it in my packet do we have the resolution for the mayor to sign I thought it was already signed bid I missed it I I okay okay for some reason someone was Randy that didn't sign them we revised it ah okay that's because the addition of the effective date in the three hours versus no hours limitations was revised okay to incorporate that and so we need signed as passed all right um whenever we take a break which will be in about 20 minutes uh if you don't mind would you get it and I'll go ahead and sign it okay all right thank you all right any other discussion on this before we move on to item number four right item four discussion of the 12th Street beach access I do not know who placed this on the agenda so I put that on the agenda and it was my recollection of the council meeting but um after going back to the audio and listening to what it exactly was said um I believe you said that um it may be you know the discussion of uh you know non-residents being on the beach maybe a discussion at a work session in the future but it wasn't actually um an item that was supposed to be put the work session um I know I imagine something about the bike rack um I just wanted to update we ordered a couple new of the recycled plastic benches um given that there's three benches already at uh 12th Street I'd like to start with just one additional bench because I had no other Park actually has six benches so you know and I did bring it up in the Parks and Recreation board meeting just you know because we're doing assessments of the parks that I wanted them to look at what the amenities were at each Park and you know make recommendations as a city-wide basis of where we need additional benches and such as I recall there was someone asking if we could put bike racks in there and but they were also the same residents that were complaining about non-residents using the beach access so I think if you put bike racks in it will create the ability for those non-residents to come and park all day at the beach and use up their beach access so I don't know there's a conflict in what they're asking for in my opinion I think they were talking they weren't asking for bike racks they were complaining people were chaining their bikes to the benches and you couldn't sit down and could we have a bike rack so they could change their bikes I think somebody in Council brought up to it was there bike racks there and there was no bike racks there and that's and I brought up that you know or all the cars have to have a sticker on it but what you just said is you can stand there on that bridge at 10 o'clock in the morning just watch all the electric bikes come over and they filter the 6th Street and 12th Street and they parked there I got pictures where they've actually set up tents like canopies two bikes pin the pin the blanket up and I took this to Mayor Schmidt and he goes that's the least of our problems it has a sense of humor when they actually were camping out underneath their uh see the sea wall they put like two bricks on the Seawall with the cover and drape it over the bikes and uh looks like hobo Village but um it's a tough one I wouldn't want to see any bike racks there and I think if you park your bike there you have to you should have to have a sticker on it well and yeah that's almost where we're where we're ready to go to because it's another vehicle and um you know I don't really know what the uh solution is we we've discussed this back whenever it hit the fan Over The Umbrellas and covet was going on and the only reasonable solution that we could come up with at the time was to issue some sort of a tag that you put on whatever it was you were taking they said hey I live here and and that was about all we could come up with um and the bicycles unfortunately they're getting more and more powerful they have longer battery life and they go fast and that's why there's a big push not to allow the e-bikes on the beach at all uh and it could it could be that I mean we have control over that lot we can pretty much say whatever we want to on that lot and we could just say no e-bikes allowed or anything and then that way if you come onto the beach at least you you've worked up a sweat to get there instead of flying over but um it's a problem even on the sidewalks I mean they're riding on the sidewalks yeah I I agree it's a real issue and um uh all of the the uh the beach communities they're having to address this in one way or another and uh many of them are are seriously considering just Banning e-bikes all out um I don't know I don't know what the solution is for Bel Air Beach uh I suspect that it won't be long before we start getting those scooters that are all over and St Petersburg in Tampa the stand-ups where they just litter everywhere because they have a homing mechanism on them and the crews just ride around and collect them every so often but they just drop them off wherever and there's they don't even have to be responsible for them they just let them go and walk away and that's that is one of those companies to show up in Indian Rocks Beach and we will have them we'll have them on our sidewalks we'll have them on our beach foreign we just have to decide if there's really anything we can do and if if it is do we want to go to that extreme uh to where we require stickers for your bike to identify the residents you know and and non-residents and then once they get there what can you do about them I mean if there's a bicycle on that lot what can you do about it and I'm not I don't want to carry a tag to the beach I'm I mean we're not New Jersey we're not doing that right I'm just sorry no but you can tag to the beach you know like a lanyard saying I'm a resident yeah yeah I know I know and that's why we didn't move forward because it just uh nobody wanted it it's too it becomes too much you could put a sticker on the handlebar or someplace on the bike on the Mainframe I mean yeah in charge of residents a few bucks a year Randy sir what what's your thoughts on uh tagging our bicycles I can't say that I've specifically analyzed the issue of tagging um bicycles or other multimodal transportation to the beach um you know I think my bigger my bigger charge or reminder to each of you is that the beaches are public parks um in in general in a general sense and where communities have implemented measures that were designed to limit public access to Parks they ended up getting sued they ended up entering into consent judgments with the ACLU or some other entity where where you've made it clear you know and I'm not suggesting that's what you folks are specifically doing you're trying to address you know nuisance and detritus in your beaches but um where that dialogue starts to push from we want to do it in a way that we make sure only residents are there that's where you're going to start to see challenges okay so but that that's not really um we're at a disadvantage and an advantage with three lots where there's three lots that are dated access for Bel Air Beach and my question is is um because we're already regulating and saying you can't park here because you're not a resident yes and we do the same thing with bicycles you can't bring your bicycle in here unless you're a resident um I've not specifically analyzed it as the short answer the longer answer is I I can see the analogy there I think from I think the bigger issue is um as the vice mayor has alluded to the the Practical elements of that you know cars are registered to to you know with the DMV you know who they go to um if somebody if I just ride my Schwinn and leave it on the side of the road and you have to hope that you find me at the same time I'm going back to my bike to know it's mine versus you know anywhere from John anyone else in John Q public I think that there's from an administrative standpoint a hard and more difficult enforcement element all right and then what about uh nuisance bicycle parking so they come up to the bench and they chain their bike to where people should be sitting do we have any repercussion on that I mean I think we can make it a violation of the code to you know adhere your bike to any structure not specifically designed for byte structure to include but not limited you know benches signposts Etc again the issue is going to be to whom does that citation issue if if your Deputy is walking the beach and sees one on a bench and I'm not saying you shouldn't regulate it for this reason just understand if your Deputy goes there and you know Belinda says Hey Deputy the bench right over here at the 19th Street access it's it's got three bikes on it okay I'm gonna go over I mean do they do they leave it on on a sticky how do we know that it gets there you know put it on its own laminated lanyard in hopes that the people find it and don't allege that it was you know discarded or lost in the weather um I I would have to I would also like the opportunity if we do go down that road to talk to to whether it's pcso or other other units and see what if anything other just we wouldn't be the first one who've had this problem what Solutions have other communities devised and can we Implement them how about just a sign on the bench please don't chain your bike yeah yeah certainly and the same before most communities and even those communities who have chosen not to regulate smoking on beaches for example because of the carve out for cigars it it really relying on a thank you for not smoking yeah we're not going to issue you a violation but yeah you know it will get some people or at least people who just weren't sure um somebody's still going to be like what do I care I mean I was 17 once I know how that works um you know what are you gonna say to me uh but I think by and large you get most of the of the general public captured through that rather than creating a bureaucracy around enforcement plus we have enough signs out there they could chain it to the sign right if they really wrote a bike down there and wanted to chain it up you know typically I would think if you're riding your bike you're watching the sunset your bike's going to be leaning against something and you're watching the sunset you leave I can't imagine someone just leaving their bike there and I I don't know not all actors are rational actors and I I go to the beach often but I have not witnessed the bikes being chained to the I know I might lean mine against the bench but I'm not leaving it right all right so uh clarification though um we're talking about the beach accesses so do we have can we put regulations in those Beach accesses with our ordinance I would have to I'd have to specifically see what documents we have about that again that was kind of my point on the front end of if this is intended for public parks and public park access less likely the mayor suggested there are some Lots where maybe the analysis is slightly different uh regardless once we get to the point where we're if we get to the point where we're talking about real policy I would want to make sure that we've made those distinctions and and that's and those kinds of questions are answered um you know obviously a different analysis right you know going on on the edge of City Hall versus in the sand on the way up to you know in the Sandy areas or edge of the page pavement as you get to where people access beaches you know that's where you're likely to see bigger problems for sure I think your point is though they're Bella Shores yeah oh if it's their property that's straight up a different it's not but it's not ours to regulate I'm I'm operating on the Assumption we're discussing city property whether we have deeded access to property it's not our property to regulate just as I may give my neighbor an easement to go over to get to their the lake if I ultimately decide to you know they can't come over and say I wanted to mow the lawn this way and put these pavers because I'm using your walkway and it's still my walkway yep okay so at this point I don't think that we have any action items or any follow-up on this item are we in agreement yes okay all right uh let's see here now we're on the item number five uh this is discussion to move Council comments immediately following the citizens comments it was placed on the agenda by council member Banker Mr Banker yes well this actually goes back to number 12 because the same Resident was wondering why he can't get an answer from Council and has to wait until Council comments at the end of the meeting this has been brought up a couple times since I've been on Council because we don't interject with the community or we don't interject with the residents so if the residents are really the integral part of this city then I say submitted two resolutions about being able to address citizens during citizens comments I never got a second out of either one of them but some of the arguments were well we could get into a heated debate and everything like that since we don't debate cancel comments why can't we just move this to right after citizens comments the council person wants to comment on whatever the citizens said we can do that if not it just it dies but rather than having citizens staying here all night long which a lot of them don't do and even that citizen left I think it should be moved because I believe before I was on Council citizens comments were either the second or last item on the agenda they were moved I believe they were moved to the end of the agenda uh by um uh mayor Manzo and uh and that was uh I I don't know why he did that uh and then um I did a resolution that passed to where we moved the citizen comments to the beginning and the reason why I did that was because whenever you make the citizens wait till the very end there's no one here so so you were able to pretty much control who spoke because if you had an agenda if you were pushing an agenda you would get your your people to wait around to the end or show up towards the end of the meeting and then keep us here all night long with a back and forth dialogue and so um I asked to move them back to the beginning but I was not able to uh I didn't because I wasn't the chair I was not able to stop the back and forth and so the show that was uh that was happening at almost every meeting instead of us um sticking around for another hour or two and almost killing each other uh it all happened at the beginning of the meeting before we got to the regular agenda so uh so I made some notes on on this item if it's okay I'll go ahead and and let you uh hear my my thoughts on it uh for the sake of meeting efficiency agenda items take first priority because each council member has taken the time for careful consideration and preparation they know what's going to be on the agenda so they put a lot of thought into it and because we approved the agenda that's the very first thing that happens we run through the agenda and the order that it's um uh that is presented uh citizen comments were moved to the beginning of the meeting so they could be heard without uh being required to stay late however these comments are not on the agenda therefore if a council member would like to respond they may do so after the approved agenda we only moved we only move I only moved the uh citizen comments to the beginning to give us time to consider what they said and then towards the end of the meeting if we decide that we want to have differing opinions on whatever the citizen comment was and we wanted to have a discussion it would come after after the after the meeting as it stands the way that Mr bankert is asking we would have not back and forth conversation with the resident but uh it could turn into where we're having a heated debate before we actually get through with our general business and our regular agenda that we've worked so hard to prepare and it was sort of derails the meeting um uh also uh let's see here I just wrote down uh Council comments are at the end of the agenda um uh let's see if specifically to address the the the direction the meeting went uh the various agenda items we went over citizen comments and items they would like to discuss in the future uh however they do not come before our approved agenda and the reason why is because a council member may want to respond to a way that a certain vote went okay uh Mr Banker a great example we do the council comments immediately following the citizen comments and then later we have uh we vote on something that you feel very strongly against but it passed uh well now you have no you have no voice to speak on that topic and so that that was kind of my general thinking was uh I want to get through our general business first and then I I appreciate the citizen speaking and I respect each and every one of them however I do not want to put their personal their a personal agendas ahead of ours until we have time to think about it possibly put it on a work session and bring it up for a formal vote if it's something that we feel strongly about uh and that's where I stand I'll take comments from other council members yes I agree with you totally I can't move the council comments up to the citizen comments I can just address some of your points true okay the approved agenda has you know layout format blueprint of what or what we need to get discuss what two things are on that agenda citizens comments Council comments so it's always been to my understanding and for two years that I make a comment other council members can't really comment on my my console comments or it dies after I get done true Council can say I didn't like what happened during an ordinance uh any type of agenda item the council has the luxury of always debating that before it goes to a vote so even if it goes to council comments or even if Council comments or first and they're not last it still dies anyway so my comments or her comments or anybody's comments whether you get them outdoor in the debate is up to you um again if the citizens are the most integral part of this city let's answer their questions while they're here if they're not then this this part will die I appreciate your comments um I'll take more yes I don't think it's gonna and gonna be a perfect solution to this issue um because you know Frank so let's say some people come up for the citizen comments and so they want an immediate response I get that if we move that up forward because we want to make it more time effective for them there may be people here that are waiting for item number seven on the approved agenda so now they're delayed so they're thinking man I'm listening to this stuff for 30 minutes now and uh dinner's cooking or whatever so that it's it's being less time effective for those people that are waiting for a specific agenda item you know I think there may be a way and I hate to even bring this up that if we had a special line item in the agenda that wasn't exactly titled um council members comments something else that was right after the citizen comments and we still had the council comments at the end but something that would be available to just address the citizens said but I think we could potentially lose a lot of time there because it would be uncontrollable potentially although there wouldn't be a back and forth each of us would have an opportunity to address What specifically was mentioned in the citizens comments and we may say nothing if we had an item there they say okay is there anything for whatever we want to call that and we could just say look at each other and nothing and mayor would say nothing we move on um and you have that right to under cities of course okay you don't have to address what they bring up but what I'm saying is um there was a woman here who was concerned about her handicapped child so someone from Council could say I'm going to address that with the city manager there was a time about wire the bench is loose okay 12th Street but we'll address that I hate to keep throwing you under the bus but we'll address that with the city marriage but I don't she's not going to debate me I'm not going to debate my comments all we're going to do is address the most important people the taxpayer you're given consideration to the people that like this building up actually I think what you're doing is you're picking and choosing um which person uh you you are setting the agenda whenever you uh you force a response on a citizen but what I'm saying is the Free Will of addressing it or not addressing it you know I'm not saying you have to address not anybody from Council has my my position is not forcing counsel to address City comments citizens comments it's giving counsel the opportunity right after citizens Commons but it would never be a back and forth just like just like just like Council comments no there's not I would like to hear other opinions I've I've served um under three Mayors and and one mayor in particular allowed comments and it turned into back and forth the way we're doing things now is a very efficient there are times I have to say where I want to respond to someone I get that I mean it's very difficult the way we do it now it's hard to move on when there's a question asked and we can't answer especially whenever they're demanding an answer but the truth is is that there is a process it's very efficient there is a process that um you know you could ask the question you can pick up the phone and call any council member absolutely anytime you want to you can email them you can whatever and if you don't get a response you can really become pesky about it and get a response eventually but uh there we work very hard to make these meetings run well and as much as I uh respect your opinion I I respectfully also disagree I appreciate it and uh and it it's not really the way that I want to run the meetings other comments before we take a informal vote on this I appreciate where council member Banker wants to acknowledge their comments and I do appreciate that more to what you stated about it's hard sometimes when they say something um however at the end of the day um we have to think of everybody's time that's spent so I'm in agreement with keeping it as we are in if there's something that we feel we need to address at the end if they have to leave for whatever reason the minutes are always available the videos available they can always come to us and find out what happened after the fact so if if they bring something to the table and they're not willing to wait until the end how big of an issue was it really or you know in the interest of time if I had something that I really really heartfelt about I'm going to stick around to the end to see if somebody addresses it well I I'm gonna I'm gonna add something to that that uh I uh I thought of uh and I didn't put it in my notes but um many times a red is a resident a citizen will come to speak to address the council and only one council member knows that it's coming okay so that one council member is prepared already has an answer ready to go to give this person however it may not necessarily represent the views of the majority and that's been one of my biggest fears and that's what happened to us in the past was that there were a few people that were getting attention over and over and over and and it it would be um they were able to steer and control the meeting and that's the last thing that I want is for uh any citizen to come in and and hijack the meeting I do 100 believe that we should um at least listen to them and and then selectively determine whether it's a uh a a some sort of an issue that needs to be addressed uh or if it's um not one way or the other anyone else yes and I think Dave you brought up a very good point earlier which was the citizens make their comments which is great and I hear it for the first time when she just brought up again I may um want to respond immediately and not really think it through so I'll be honest with you sometimes if somebody asks me something like that and I'm ready immediately after that to respond to it as opposed to by the time it gets to the end of the meeting I may have thought it through a little bit more and chosen to not actually say anything at all at that point or hopefully what I say at the end of the meeting is a little bit more thought out based on the comments that the citizen made so sometimes it is a benefit I know with me personally to calm down a little bit based on what somebody may have said and wait later to talk about it that's just me uh one of the things that I do uh the way that I conduct my meetings are is I use other municipalities and the county as an example we we do that in not just the meetings but we do that with a little bit of everything Kyle I'm sure that you've reached out to other municipalities and hey what are you guys doing it's always a good practice to I mean we're we're actually watching what's happening with uh with Indian Rocks Beach right now to find out what their future holds and so um whenever I look at all the municipalities and I surveyed the Mayors on The Big C because I I knew that this was coming up I asked them hey how do you do it what do you do and pretty much everybody runs it the way that that I'm doing this um if if the majority of the council would like for me to change it I will I will uh absolutely do that but I uh I ask each and every one of you too please allow me to continue because I think we're doing a great job yeah this isn't any reflection on your job that you're doing and I think everyone's starting to go off the what I proposed here the thing again is you have the prerogative to address or Not address I mean if you're a little bit hot-headed to a dressing why would you address it okay you would wait or maybe address it the following ones um I I don't think everyone's grasping what I'm trying to pull in here all I'm asking is the council wants to address it right after citizens Commons it should be addressed thank you would it would that also include if one council member comments on the Citizen's comment then can another council member comment on that other council members comments you know I mean are we opening up well not directly that's what it turns into yeah well and that's and historically that's what's happened yes is that whether you know you're opening up a debate the possibility for a debate and I can assure you right now if anybody here says something to a citizen that I strongly disagree with I'm going to interrupt you and say that I disagree so um I don't I don't want that and uh and I just don't think that it's healthy so let's do a quick informal vote if if there are no more comments about this you okay with that yeah all right uh Frank I'm for it all right Belinda I'd like to leave it as we have it as we have it leave it as we have it all right it is okay and uh and I feel the same way so uh I appreciate everyone's comments and now let's move on to item number six uh also uh on uh the agenda by uh council member bankert a discussion of the Norfolk pine tree at 804 Harbor Drive yes um going back to the prime Escape services that we did about 10 months ago 11 months ago the Arbors that came out clearly says in their reinspection is recommended in one year to mire any changes I know there was some follow-up on this have we reached any type of resolution with the Atlanta owner of that because it's I think it's under an LLC from what I've researched about the removal of that tree or anything so the prime escape the one that the city solicited I have a date of November 5th November that was done okay I thought it was done in June no I'm sorry that was the other Lance uh the other guy had it done privately are we going to be doing another survey on that my thoughts at the time were given the attention that's brought to the tree that that in a year we would reassess [Music] any movement from the owner on that property the owner was agreeable to letting anyone else remove the tree he just didn't feel like he needed to be responsible for that truth that he considers is not a danger how about the nuisance my uh ordinances we have because I went to the county I guess it was November or October of last year and uh the county more or less said well if you guys can't afford it we could probably come out and remove it because their their Council actually looked up our ordinances and said I think I emailed you that I think I emailed or Council that um and then they found out was belar beaches as well I don't think he's got money problems but um so we're not coming up doing anything for you but they said there we believe you're nuisance laws clearly show that trees possibly in harm of falling into an easement into a house then it should be removed so I know this you're saying that the owner says if you want to cut it down we'll cut it go get it cut down but have we ever thought about citing him for it my opinion was given the report that I was given that the city solicited um that it was a slippery slope to enforce this tree as a dangerous tree because I I feel you could go around the city and planted a lot of trees and then we'd be in a different situation all right so we're going to go through another hurricane season with a standing I I know me personally I own a lot of properties and someone's tree grows on my property I have to cut it myself they're not and I have one right here in Largo it's an adjacent property to an attorney and she is not cutting the tree back I have to do it and I spend about five thousand dollars a year keeping this tree trimmed back so you know I well it's not the trimming voice mayor it's the possible falling on the houses same that's the reason I trim it that's the reason I choose to trim it is to save my property so if they usually if you go in their property to trim it or yes because I know she's not going to that's not true but if he's giving permission then it would just be a simple phone call to whoever's house it might you know they're whoever's concerned about it they could take make a phone call to the owner and say hey we'd like to remove the tree do you mind get him get a written letter from him he did say that he would sign a document that we prepared now let me let's go back a little bit I thought that the last time we had a discussion about this that you were going to reach out to neighboring uh the the people that surrounded that property and see if they would be interested in funding removal of the tree I thought that's what we were does that sound familiar uh I I remember saying that I would find out if if I think Professor we were going to try to get them to pay for it and then you were going to expedite it if it if it could happen if if he would allow it and that they would I recommended that to some of the neighbors what you just said that I believe we're at the status what you just said and I think that they whenever I you know did a just a brief would you be willing to I thought that they said that they would um because they all want it gone and so I think the question is is if they do agree with that you said that the homeowner is not uh he's not against you removing the tree is that right so so what's the difference not to interrupt you so could we just top it you know what I'm saying cut half of it off I I don't I don't think it would you know what they did on my street what a neighbor had a really tall one I think it might snap I just want to be really clear about the pronouns and antecedents we're using here about like we and us and they and them what the manager has discussed is if the neighbors privately wish to amass some money and arrange for somebody to do it the property owner has indicated that I would assume provided they coordinate with them that they can do as they well pleased but he has no intention to do it the we us them is not the city at this stage yes we're basically we're looking for a liaison somebody to say or do you guys want to do this and it's about 75 feet let's say so we knock it down to 35 feet I don't think that violates it well I would say you're still going to have a dead tree though yeah but if it falls it falls in the vacant lot then you still just need to get a letter I think and whatever you guys whatever that that group of residents decide I'm sure you could give them the phone number to reach out to the owner and well I think that okay it's a little more complicated I think that the the the the the property owner does not like those neighbors and I think that if the city was doing it he was okay with it but does that ring a bell yeah he's been much more agreeable when I've communicated with him than when the neighbors directly right I think you I think your term not like I think it might resonate to hate is there a neighbor he likes I wasn't gonna go that far but um uh is there a neighbor that he likes that he could that could reach out to him I mean well if because I hate to put I don't think the city should be in the middle of this right I think that's what Randy's saying right right Randy Randy did he mediate a letter though to get this done he can do as he wishes I just my my concern here is I don't want to compromise the city it's what I'm saying yeah I mean my advice is unless we have a code enforcement action which at this point the manager has clearly communicated is not the direction the city's moving in the city can facilitate by saying the residents you know residents are interested in you know your neighbors are interested here's you know do you have any objection to me sharing their contact information or is there a you know a person I can put you in touch with to coordinate or put them in touch with on your behalf maybe if he feels that way and he says hey I have a property manager or I have a lawyer they can call my lawyer and figure out a time I don't want to talk to those people and I'm not putting words in that resident's mouth I know nothing about that property owner or any of these people I'm not characterizing anybody um but if he doesn't wish you much in the same way the residents are somewhat suggesting they would like for the city manager to facilitate it perhaps he has his own agent or author or somebody he can put them in touch with and they can have their you know third parties talk to one another right so um Frank you can as the neighbor make that phone call right yes if I can get can I I'm a little leery of our commissioner being a council member being a neighbor I just can't my my my feeling my feet that's just a not not a full legal thing it's more of an Optics thing the idea is oh yeah it's a neighbor but they're the council member the council member who's been very vocal on this issue and it's going to feel it may be characterized as more heavy-handed than just like oh my neighbor I recognize you wear both hats I just I I do want to sensitize you to those Optics so um find someone else on your street Frank you um are you a chainsaw you added this onto the agenda so um you know I obviously you you have a uh uh you already have an open dialogue with a residents surrounding this tree um and there's only one I think he dislikes I think I think better I think there's two well harshly dislikes the other one he just doesn't like but um I'm looking for guides on you know what I'm saying right uh well this is one of those uh we had a situation um in fact it was at the end of vice mayor Street uh with a cul-de-sac and just went down there and said hey you guys come out here and just work it out and they did and they they you know they're not 100 happy but they're at least they were able to work something out this guy's in Vegas you know what I'm saying it's was it hard for you to get in touch with them I got him with an email he changes his number a lot yeah I can imagine um I'm going to run it by the citizens again and see where they want to go I might be asking you for the email if that's okay this is what I would do if I were you I would go to those those residents that are concerned with the tree and first ask them if they would be willing to work together to to pay for the the tree removal and then I would find a non um uh non-associated resident someone else to make the phone call and then you step away from it because it's not a it's just really not a city um is maybe it's stated it's not something we want to get too involved in because we don't want to appear to be pushing someone around and I'll just withdraw this part but I'm just going to withdraw this part from the this agenda then I mean it doesn't need a vote or anything like that well we weren't voting on it whether you were just it's a discussion there's a problem and this is a work session we can talk about anything if the neighbors who are complaining about it have been told that they can take it down and that the owner says that's okay and maybe this is a question for Randy or it's the lawyer and me can they not complain if the tree falls on there house you know if they were told they could cut it down but they don't and then it falls on their house I'm not going to opine on private properties private property owners rights or defenses um you know much in the same way that the commentary has thus far been the the absent code enforcement action the city doesn't have a role in this um in a lot of these instances in the mayor has offered other examples where we've asked people to either be good neighbors or work it out themselves if they have private causes of action they wish to bring or can render and I'm not suggesting there are or not but that's for them to decide and in the same vein if they feel that they are you know waving some right defensive power that's for them to analyze I won't open on it okay okay um before we end this uh does anyone have any uh comments on this agenda item yeah okay because what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use this as a Segway only for the Henry's that came in earlier um I know that they're not here but they may uh look at the video and uh uh what I'm going to ask from City attorney Mora is just an update on the situation uh that you're working on with the tower is is there anything that you can share with us at this time or are we still where we were uh the last time we received an email about it so for the benefit of all and to make sure we're all on on the same page um last Monday I believe it was I transmitted a um or maybe it was Sunday night I transmitted a memorandum that was Monday because I needed to talk to Kyle um I transmitted a memorandum last Monday night to you uh I want to say it was in the neighborhood of I know it was more than 10 pages I can't remember if it was 20. but it was a lengthy memorandum analyzing providing the chronology of events um as they as best understood based on staff records and otherwise providing an analysis of the federal regulatory landscape the case law interpreting it the state landscape case law or absence thereof interpreting it in our local ordinances and then how does that all align with where we stand and and the The Cliff Notes version of that for for all was um private property owners have rights and we have to reconcile those rights and this is a two things can be true and and since we seem to be very comfortable invoking Indian Rocks Beach uh tonight I I will invoke Indian Rocks Beach and it's it's debate and discussion on short-term rentals as an example where certain Property Owners say well what about my rights I I invested in a quiet home on a cul-de-sac now I live next to a hotel or a motel and there are some property owners that feel that way and other property owners say this is this home has been in my family for years or I recently acquired it and why I acquired it doesn't matter it's my property and I wish to use it in this way that state law allows me to use and those feel mutually exclusive but the law supports both um and we have to find a way to balance those interests as best we can as regulators uh and so where the landscape stands presently is while I certainly recognize sympathize with and understand the articulated concerns about safety Aesthetics uh consistency Etc as it relates to the antenna structure um operated or that exists at 105 8th for amateur antenna radio operation the law also provides a property owner who wishes to engage in that hobby or operation as long as it is an amateur basis which there's every evidence thus far that that's what's going on that zoning alone just simply saying well this is a residential area you can't do it is not adequate and the memorandum spoke extensively about the specific fact-finding that needs to go into that the effort to negotiate and reach a reasonable accommodation which is terminology you usually see associated with Adas and and then those other type actions but taking that same uh Paradigm and applying it here a reasonable accommodation requires you to actually delve into the very fact specific scenario area being proposed here and understand that and so what was done that the memo concluded with a bulleted list of of the kinds of questions that we would seek in the um restatement that the property owner's lawyer and the City attorney me both agree that a permit is required for this structure regardless obviously this is not the kind of structure you permit on a regular basis the usual paradigms may not fully apply as to how the former what the form requires Etc and so while there are certain elements that will be required we need to know where it's going to be in its Dimensions there are some added questions that we've we've articulated by um I want to say it was by Thursday of last week I emailed his attorney with communicating those questions and some more indicating that his administrative contact was manager refler I haven't had a chance yet to see if he's contacted Mr Riesling but uh thus far not I was going to ask him tonight and then follow up with his attorney and a call tomorrow if that had not happened I had indicated in that email that it would be preferable if they are submitting a permit to do so post haste and preferably in the next 14 days or at least explain why that may not be a feasible time based on what they need to compile or otherwise you know so either do it in this time or at least let us know what what time we can reasonably expect and why um so that there is some motion forward and I'd communicated uh that's you Mr remember bankert on that day and so um I I do know that Henry's came in and introduced themselves briefly to me and spoke with the mayor um from what I've overheard there was some concern is there is there any possibility that this could exist in in that an antenna structure could exist in this neighborhood from a legal standpoint I'm not saying that it is a done deal is there any version of this where this is possible yes there is does it have to look like what's there presently I don't know um because that's part of what this process is is designed to determine for example if his amateur operation requires him to go to x feet and his roof is X feet minus three is there a reason help me to understand why it's not reasonable to say affix this to the roof or fix this to some other element on the property um and again those questions have been posed we're waiting for those answers and that's where we stand working through it I I understand the um just because this is now being addressed in a public meeting and there are public records that have circulated in the form of communications with you I know I've addressed this with some of you who I have the opportunity to speak with individually um I also want to address the point that this posture is not because of some fear of litigation my practice regularly involves litigation frankly I prefer it to late night meetings but uh litigation all because of what I do here I also know and because I am a litigator I know what this looks like on both sides and I know what it is to litigate on an undeveloped record or on knowing what the case law is and saying well you know pardon the language Damn the Torpedoes were forging ahead regardless if I can set you up for a better defensive position if we even get to a defensive position that's in Better service of the client on a risk management standpoint and as just a general litigator um you know the the other idea that their legal counsel has bullied us I I want to make it clear in the record as I said in the memo their legal counsel while he does have a position that may differ from some in the community has been a a consummate professional and is dealings with me we've had candid exchanges he sent me case law I sent in case law and we've discussed our our varying points and by and large have reached agreements at least on what the general overarching legal principles are what that looks like in execution it may be different and again we're navigating that thus far there has not been in our exchanges a bunch of posturing or you know Guerrilla chess beating on I'm gonna you know I'm gonna Crush you and you will see it's can we find a solution here I think we can bring person for landing my client needs to make better permitting submissions absolutely more prepared to do that we just need to know what the city wants so we're not so the goal post doesn't keep moving I'm not alleging and they haven't accused us of moving goal post just let's have shared expectations and get to a Finish Line um and and then determine if something can be reached or not um so that's I know I've kind of uh rambled at this point so I'll stop but that's where we stand I'm happy to answer any more targeted questions if you have them well nine years ago when I moved here he had a antenna probably about two widths of those doors there up on the side of this house yes sir and but it was very a very flimsy antenna so if it took off in the wind you know what I'm saying but do minimal damage okay where this is a tower understood um which has got the neighbors upset because that's that's going to come that's going to projectile and and both of you and I said this before both of you guys did a marvelous fabulous job at the hearing in front of the match yes sir and even Mr pinholster noted that his Tower was couldn't stand 100 mile an hour which I got up and I said well I think Pinellas County wants it at 140 so they're they're in itself it should be removed but um I understand your whole process your dot in the eyes you're crossing the t's because if this does go in front of the federal or whatever you're gonna have to make sure that we gave him every possible Doorway to come in and when we shut them we shot them because of this if we do yes sir yes um and and I would submit to you again that while I'm suggesting that there is a possibility and not necessarily a definite probability and I just don't know because I I it's I know it's cliche but I don't know what I don't know yet I'm waiting for particulars before I could render any opinion but just because something may be allowed doesn't mean it needs to be allowed in the same manner that it is now I will say that as a testament to the um civil dealings between the parties his attorney has represented to me and at this point I have no evidence to the contrary um that that antenna has not been vertical in 2023 and likely really the last two months of 2022 as well and would not be going up until we could resolve this so that not so as not to antagonize the situation or create additional enforcement issues um mayor I couldn't help but over here though I was working on another matter that the Henry's had suggested that the precise location of the tower may have moved recently possibly closer to the home though perhaps still on the side that may be in direct response to my communication to his attorney which was consistent with the memorandum saying you know one of the questions he had was while we develop a proposal what is permitted as of right generally and I said again I'm not a building official I'm not the manager I can't say if you do this it's fine but looking at our code one of the elements is the side setback and it would need to be x amount of feet from the side step back and so perhaps want that move and I don't know this I've not spoken to his attorney this is pure speculation but it seems consistent with the fact that I make this transmission on Thursday we are here Monday and it seems to have moved away from the fence and towards the structure I don't know about footings and concretes and how how it was moved and what was moved but it seems that it's moving away from the setback again consistent with the direction we're moving in of achieving compliance which is what his what his Council stated um to be clear that the it is presently on a cranking mechanism I I've heard that the the residents uh concerns um I I don't like to qualify them as complaints so their concerns that you know it seems that when he is operating this he needs the assistance needs or employees for whether he needs it or not the assistance of Youth you know as teenage grandson friends people he hires I don't know it's it's sort of besides the point and there's a concern of are those people always going to be around when it needs to come down if there's some kind of exigent circumstance and unexpected storm or something that that requires it's coming down when that time comes um and those are all things that we can address but presently it is it is more Akin in its current um configuration it's really more akin to a utility Tower that's sort of attached to a shed or something not a tower sorry utility ladder or something of the sort that it's a large aluminum structure for sure that is slightly maybe incrementally above the fence line if you're driving in the front but it's not teetering over a home or a property line at this stage and that's what I've asked the neighbors is uh it's just notify me if you see the tower go up and then uh I will notify city manager and I do plan to contact his Council tomorrow again I was waiting to see if there have been some contact I just didn't have an opportunity to talk to Kyle today because of my other caseload but um given that I have not yet received an email and I also have to check my SPAM because he has a an orthodox email address that sometimes gets routed there but um by tomorrow I'll confirm whether there's just just confirming the receipt of my email for nothing else but the actions seem to be consistent so you don't know if he's going to submit one within two weeks or not because you're not at that point I just haven't heard back from him I I again the to the extent I have any confirmation of the receipt of my email it appears to be that action but that's speculation I would like to talk to him and see where they're at and if they take issue with anything that we I didn't send him the full memo though of course it's a public record I distilled his concerns and addressed those in the email at that time uh Council I would like to apologize I let us run long during this before the break uh we're up to General business but what I'd like to do is take five minutes comment about that or can we still comment on this on this week all right just to owe everyone a break and then we'll uh we'll we'll come right back you okay with that yeah number seven and that was going to lead into what he was talking about foreign oh uh we're still waiting on Patty six seconds whatever makes you happy honey yes exactly that was your hostile Decor okay so we were uh we were back to vice mayor Shirley she had questions or comments Oh no just a couple of comments um regarding the tower and that is um first Randy thank you so much for all the information it was a lot to digest but very helpful we I was receiving several emails and um your email helped clear up some things and I appreciate that I I want to be aware of property owners rights and um very cautious not to overreact with the residents reaching out to us oftentimes we want to please the resident that's complaining or reaching out to us with their concerns and not um not really take a step back and look at the overall picture so I just want to caution everyone on that and what I was thinking about some of the concerns I received from adjacent residents I also got some comments from other residents that are adjacent to this property that had no concerns at all so there's both sides but it brought me to think about the sign ordinance that we just approved to place a 35-foot flagpole in people's front yards and I want to be certain that we have thought that through and we have a permitting process for those flagpoles and what our expectations are of them because this to me is no different than that flagpole just food for thought don't need to discuss it right now but first thing that came to my mind when I looked at this antenna so um that was all okay thank you very much all right uh any other discussion on the item six before we move to item seven not General business oh all right item seven modify city code section 2-335 appeal regarding an appeal of the city managers decisions to add must be done in writing and served by certified mail this was added by council member bankard uh Mr Banker yeah this actually goes back to uh number six or not number six uh the tower discussion and um when I was talking to our City attorney I was saying well how did he appeal this and he said well he sent some email to the city clerk and I think the City attorney just gave me more ammo because he says he has to check his spam tonight because of certain emails this poor soul works hard enough I mean whether she has to check her spam every day or whatever I don't I don't check my SPAM I don't know about you guys or whatever but I can't believe we don't have a better system of serving for an appeal when the city manager denies something overboard so I'm not at exactly 100 sure it should be under Section 2-335 um what I'm saying is there's there should be a system that we have if the board or the city of a board or the city manager denies something there should be a way that it gets appealed in a fashion that we know about it not that oh I sent an email you know a month ago or whatever and then now you're searching your email and some spam accounts actually delete on their own after 15 30 days or whatever so um I just think it would be a proper way of doing business so um I understand the the how there was a slight mishap recently and and uh something was overlooked or it wasn't picked up in a timely basis uh and I agree with you um that we need a better way of doing it um I think uh I I don't know if it's if really uh certified mail is a requirement because some people just never go to the Post Office and don't want to deal with that but I think that we could certainly have just like we have a permitting process where you have specific forms that you you have to complete we should have an appeal form that you complete and you submit and you have uh the the city clerk sign off that hey I received this and then you give that person a copy and then therefore now you've got a tracking mechanism and it's something that um just like every other form we do I think it's just something that was missing from our collection of documents um total agreeing with you what you said there is is that is that sound acceptable rather than changing a changing uh well I think we would still I just said I was wrong anyway where the code was so yeah yeah so so um the reason I shook my head in regards to this appeals appear in your code in in a lot of different places and in different uh forms um I do want to be very clear um especially because you've expressed some concern about this in the past council member Banker as it relates to appeal of a code Code Enforcement magistrate Code Compliance from a special magistrate order there is a very there's a very distinct process for that right um you know set forth by Statute and otherwise so notices of appeal for a special Master's decision are already dealt with the appeal as it related to the manager's denial of a permit in this particular context really is is comes from your board of adjustment um code Provisions where it sets their powers and duties and one of them is is uh under 94.62 sub uh B and C one of their part um their powers is to hear and decide and appeal from an administrative decision or order made by a city official where there is alleged to be an error in the order or decision in the enforcement of this article and that's what was really being invoked here I found an error or what I believe to be an error in the denial of this permit and then the next provision in C is the city manager shall receive and process each appeal to the board and then it goes on to say you know within I'm not not talking about days but just disposition and blah blah blah blah um I think the mayor's has touched on something that that could be a solution here without the need to go on a first and second reading of Child by by registered mail the only thing that I would suggest is and and Kyle and I can work on this is to the extent there are you know whether it's part of a permitting package or other things where we regularly communicate a decision having writer language you know any appeal of this decision shall be submitted on a form to be produced by city hall or made available at City Hall and you know adding some language to the city website on if you wish to file an appeal please use this form disseminating that form in that kind of way so people are aware of its existence and not I I would hate for us to be in a position and I certainly wouldn't um you know find it problematic if we say oh you didn't find our special secret form um without necessarily making people aware that it exists and and how to access it um if if you know and I I'm speaking without the manager having added some input on this I was shaking my head about that you know that was the provision that got them here there's various appeals referenced in your code and that was you know when we talked about a code review one of those things that we would want to harmonize if we did get to that point um and I know the manager's got some some Future Vision on how what that might look like but and that's what I wanted to add as far as why I was shaking hit in my head and also what potential Solutions might exist subject of course to administration's input well I like the way the mayor put it and I don't I don't know why we couldn't just attach it to a denial you know when you the form this this form must be filled out yeah it's just part of the process is keep it as simple as possible but have it noted you know this is needs to be the proper way yeah um being that you know there's some parts of the administrative appeals discussing the code would that hold up though if we just present it in that way with a denial um and we prefer we provide that means yeah I mean it certainly goes beyond what we're we're doing presently I I don't know and in as much as we're sort of now signaling to people Beyond here's your denial and if you want to appeal it figure it out because we don't give legal advice I don't give legal advice what do I do if I want to challenge it the code addresses appeals of managers decisions do with it what you wish um and so in that regard I think would be sufficient again I would want to make sure that we're checking the the notice box of letting people know and that's what we're talking about doing um again I wouldn't reinvent the wheel I would look to other communities and say hey do any of you have especially because we serve about a dozen saying seeing if anybody has a sample that they use in their communities to to trigger that if not we can develop one it's not that difficult um I would still submit that you know I want to be clear what we're really talking about here is the notice of the appeal the it's it's not necessarily you know they may thereafter have additional items they wish to supplement with and you know in that what we really want to address is give me the notice what was the what was you know fields we would want for example by whom was the decision issued because it's not necessarily only the manager uh what was the decision date what was the content of it attach a copy of the decision you seek to to appeal if it is in writing etc etc I'm a bit confused is the appeal of a decision on a permit request is that I'm I'm confused because if the uh there's a standard permitting process it's just the process right so they didn't like the answer they got from you on something you denied on their permit so they resubmit I I'm not in theory yes I mean you can revise and I don't know I'm not not understanding why there's so much conversation about this appeal and why they're appealing when they just would resubmit and come in and talk to you well that is that is a preferred solution at first but if if you reach a terminal point where but I want X and the city manager saying I've read our code you're not allowed to have X and say well I read your code and I think you can I think you're reading it wrong um and we had that situation not just in the context of that data structure but another property where we were talking about sorry um another property where there was an interpretation relative to what could be built over grade or over the first floor and we you know staff was reading it one way and the applicant and their agent were reading it another and said it take it to the board and said I think your manager's reading your code wrong I think I think your code is being administered and so you know and so and and again those issues certainly sensitize us to those instances as with the more recent change on the variance um not variance but the setback and Bellevue Estates that's an example of where like oh we've discovered an issue and we need to address it but until that issue is addressed sometimes their only recourse is not to revise no matter how many times they revise they're not going to be if the interpretation is you can't have this well I think I can and then you know so that's why you get appeal it's not frequent I mean maybe I just am a magnet for them you've had two in my tenure but outside of that it's not common but you do want to make sure if you're having the process that it's administered consistently and this is this is uh dealing with just the city manager saying no the only way you'd ever get this is through a variance or the code changing or code changing uh and then and then they want to challenge it without going through the variance process and and that's the appeal we're referring to is that right Yes except to say that again the scope of the upheaval is they allege that there's an error in the order or decision in the enforcement of the article um so the basis for the appeal is not just like I don't like the answer in guys I think he's doing it wrong I think they did the wrong thing if Kyle opinion tomorrow that the only kind of pool somebody could have is an above ground kiddie pool um somebody's like well that doesn't seem right he's like well that's just how I'm reading it but you know somebody would go through that kind of process to pick an absurd thing that could get you to a real result okay um any more comments or questions on this topic because we're talking about the code um just in my you know four months of being city manager there's a lot of issues um well I wouldn't say issues but just questions with the code and um I think it would be beneficial to to form another Review Committee at least with our residents um because I know we talked about like a major overhaul but um that that had a monetary like a price to it but you know in the past five years since I've been here um code review boards have been formed in different areas of code work I'm selected to be discussed and uh there's some points I'd like to bring up and look at it we've done it once on the council and once you know you are on the Council of the first go-round I I was a sideliner and then the second time we did it together but uh it's probably has it been how long has it been I don't know I thought that I thought Lynn Reeves had it done but what's happening is they're focusing on bushes and grass and no one has any construction experience they're reaching out to Residents to read line by line through this code if we're going to do it we need to hire a professional who can help us with construction code and talk about are we going to put in some architectural design parameters and things like that you know we ended up with this your pool couldn't be higher than the grade of the road just stupid things that keep getting changed by having the residents do it and that's makes absolutely no sense when you have a you know your finished floors at 14 feet and your pool's at zero you know it's just makes absolutely no sense why those codes have been changed and modified like that and I think that if we're going to do it we need to do it right and spend a little money I would suggest too is as you talk about that you may wish to consider the the Paradigm of having your code of ordinances reviewed one way right in your Land Development code reviewed another when you treat them as as similar you're right there's a very big distinction between do we want to limit the skate park hours from 8 to 12 or only allow these only rollerblades and like these are the kinds of legislative I'm not trying to trivialize all the legislative but those are very distinct from you know what grade is and how you're defining where whether you're measuring from the crown of the road or you know from BFE and all those kinds that's hyper technical where your Land Development code goes and also Land Development code May because it's land use may come with attendant issues of legal impacts of oh we're down zoning this or and I'm not suggesting anybody's trying to propose that but you know Land Development codes can have more collateral impacts than changing purely legislative regulations on how other parts of the city are administered so when you talk about a code review there's most codes are subpart a is your you here are the laws you can break and stuff are B is and here's how you get to use your land um and so that that is where communities have endeavored to do a code review sometimes they bifurcate those too okay um which I highly recommend what's that I highly recommend separating the two and we've discussed this I think that we uh we kicked it down the road a little bit just because we wanted um these two settle in and deal with the immediate problems and then we go back and we focus on that and what I recommend is uh is pretty much in alignment with Randy is that uh we we tackle sections not the whole thing we we just focus on a couple of areas and knock it out perfect it make sure that it doesn't impact other areas and then uh just a little along instead of all at once I think that it's probably too much to digest if we do it all at one time um but file do you want me to start looking at um through the county if there's any consultation or you know assistance they can provide or rather than going private with when we're talking land use codes and construction codes and we're just making some options um because yeah she does bring up with the point that uh you know the average resident does not have very much experience in the language of those code you're right about that work right it's changing rules about shrubs and hedges and that's the entire code review was every meeting about is it a bush or is it grass or is it a tree or is it and I'm like oh my gosh so um how about the league of cities to see if they have um you know someone who can assist us with the the construction Land Development code right there and then if not then I might have some resources there are some uh I do have some um just from my experience being the flood plain and managed administrator for the city um some parts of the flood code I'd like to have considered so there are other parts okay so I'm kind of looked at I I believe in that fashion that the the CAC could operate in that way as a code review board um because it's not Land Development or am I incorrect in that flip flood code flood code is in Your Land Development code I believe yeah and you would have to you know on top of any consistency determination with your comp plan you know we definitely would want the planner reviewing for consistency with County elements and all that okay and I'd love to add some feedback too on the flood when you're if you're looking at flood I you know there's some things we could do on the lots that front water their Waterfront add some Code Compliance that's not there that new development is not doing that they could manage the runoff from their property and their roof line at right out to the you know intercoastal rather than onto our streets that we're still managing it on the streets and we're in your pool yeah and no one I mean it's a very easy thing to do during construction but it's not our code and so we're not no one does it because it costs a few bucks right and uh I I think Mike Kelly had mentioned that there were there was definitely something uh with a pool code I didn't quite understand it but uh uh the 18 inches above the elevation of the crown of the road oh so um yeah so right now where we're at we're doing the comprehensive plan with the Planning and Zoning Board so we have to get through that all right after that it would be the sign ordinance so then I guess after that all right any other comments on uh vice mayor Shirley's comment no what's the plan of attack on this obviously we're waiting uh for this one phase to finish and then what's what's up next after that foreign yes okay so um right now we're working on the advertisement do we have the dates that I cannot remember no yeah so no so we're uh we're drafting the the advertisement and the ordinance yep okay so as soon as that is done then it'll serve as our public hearing for the recommend or the approval from the Land Development board okay and then it'll come to you guys all right and then uh uh uh well any other questions or on that at all or can we move on General business everybody good with that okay um before I start does anyone have any general business they would like to discuss no I know okay so I I've been um thinking about many things um and uh first I want to say I don't want this I don't use it I I can't make myself learn an iPad I just I'm great with computers but this is not what I want to do for the next two years so I'm I'm uh gratefully returning it and uh I I don't know what we're gonna do with them but I look and I don't see anyone else I use mine are you using yours yeah because I don't allow any City business on any of my devices it goes right here okay all right well I um I just use mine for email and I'll I'll you know construct a document or something but uh everything's being archived and Paddock and retrieve it if we ever get any records requests but I just I I have no use for it and uh I like the fact that we have all of these uh documents uh in fact I purposely did not pick up my packet and I wanted to see how I could do on my laptop and I had actually worked out well I write notes on this and I viewed the document here and and I'm I'm okay with that um that being said how many of these have been turned in already I think you'll be the third okay uh do we should we liquidate them does the staff have a use for them I I don't know the the good news is is they were paid for from the uh Department of Justice grant for coven so it was the the idea as I sold it um we we could use them if we ever were in a situation again that we had to be mobile or at home and we could hold meetings using devices okay uh well is it all right if I store mine here then sure okay great weren't we supposed to go paperless and was it Windows 95 when that came out yeah yeah I hear you okay um so the next thing that I wanted to bring I'm trying not to keep everybody too late um I still owe um I still owe you guys a marina plan and we haven't done it uh I've I've I have a told Kyle that I was going to get with him I just have not had time uh and then of course we had the situation in the family and I appreciate everyone reaching out and uh uh sending their condolences I'll get there okay and we will have this conversation and then we'll give you something to look at and and debate over uh the next thing is as you know I'm on The Big C and uh what what I I also attend the mayor's Council of Pinellas County meetings and uh there's other other councils and committee uh committees and and whatever that I could be involved in what I have discovered and this is probably on me was whenever times were hard and and we weren't very happy um we we voted to do term limits and I and before I go any further I am not asking for term limits to be changed for me but I am asking this Council to consider adding a third term to whoever is next and the reason why is because all of the mayor's Council Pinellas County uh The Big C uh Suncoast League of cities I believe there's in the same shape is that I can't serve as an officer and the and they want they want me to be more involved and I can't do it and so what what happens is I really don't have as much influence on other communities and the county as I would if I were able to serve as an officer and unfortunately whenever you're a two-termer I think this city is has probably learned that um there's probably not going to be many surprises this community is probably going to watch and and watch somebody serve on the council before they elect a mayor unless it's somebody that's already served and then they come back in but in my case I served on the council now I'm the mayor but I'm not eligible for anything outside of right here because they all know that I'm terming out at the end of this term and so um I'm not asking for any action items or anything tonight but I'm I'm asking for all of you to kind of consider this situation and are we doing the very best for our community that we can because what I see is that other communities are having more influence over over the whole area whereas we're not really considered anything because of our size and also because I can't serve on as an officer and that's how you make changes so something to consider I know that it would have to be on uh on you know it would have to be on a ballot during an election to change our Charter again enough that something else that that speaking of uh elections and our Charter and the way that we handle things I know that we're on this three-year thing and I'm beginning to wonder if it's too expensive if we would save money if we just ran our elections with the general elections rather than this Oddball you know in March and uh one year and then like maybe if we had four-year terms instead of three-year terms and we we had an election every two years one during the regular uh general election and then we had one during the midterms and we just piggybacked off of uh to save money uh just again things that I've been thinking about now that I know what I know um and and that's really about it uh yes I have always thought personally that term limits were a good thing and I always was thinking that on a federal government level when you see people that are in those positions for eternity it appears and for some reason they keep being reelected and it almost looks like they're not sure what they're doing anymore just just saying I think at a city level and I heard this guy on the radio just driving home one day and he said I used to be for term limits now it doesn't make any sense to me because clearly if somebody's not doing the job properly you vote them out it's not difficult to do that so my I just pay go over to the other side I am 100 against term limits I've had more than a few citizens talk to me specifically about this issue so I should have brought it up I forgot um I think my guess my first question is when do we if we want to change the charter how ahead of time do we have to submit whatever we need to submit to make it go before a vote does anybody know that answer I can't tell you a precise deadline as it varies by election um it's usually a good my recollection the last time I did so it was like for a March election it was like December 15th you know in terms of getting information out and and before that December 15th we have to have had a vote on the ordinance it's been the form of ordinance and resolution on do we have this and then if we do have it what does the ballot language read um so it there's definitely lead time right um it's not something you decide you know a month or two before the election but okay um you do it's also not a year out either right so I just want to make that comment I agree with you 100 I think it uh I think it just makes sense and I think clearly at a city level if um somebody's not doing the job that the citizens feel that person is doing and they run again they're not going to win it's just that simple I disagree with that well as Nancy Pelosi who's one of my least favorite women said when AOC was elected if you put a glass of water on the ballot in that District it would get elected and is the the populace isn't in tune they don't look at the numbers that come to the polls less than 40 percent sometimes 20 percent um there's enough people to serve and I think there should be a refreshing of a cabinet of a council of Congress of a senate every few years I was a totally against terminals I I felt exactly you did 20 years ago but how the hell can a person like Nancy Pelosi stay in offices how can people like Joe Biden who's never done anything what I'm saying it's Federal but it's the same thing it government starts at the local lowest level okay and then it resonates up that's why I was so concerned about going into a bond issue are we getting into the big government by now you know going in debt um I think there's I think everybody in Bellaire Beach you have to serve on Council for one term it should be like it should be like Purgatory uh it's like Purgatory okay those Catholics they understand what I'm talking about my understanding is historically there was a time when this city could hardly even get anybody right to fill a position so somebody would be in that position and they wanted out and they were told somebody tapped them on the shoulders said you know nobody's signing up for this would you do it another term so I don't think there's enough people here that really want to do it well that's but that's my point and there's not enough people that go to the polls so you have to get people involved I think the last time there were a lot of people that went to them yeah and look at the time before that and the time before that the time before that right yeah there was a lot of influx of money last time too I see I see both sides I mean I I definitely do because when you're new on Council it probably takes you a year to gear up right so there's a big learning curve and sure and so I I so you lose a lot of time in the beginning um I also I just have this conversation with my son-in-law today we're talking about term limits and I'm in support of it but not I think we've limited it too short I think with this last review we did we did you know it was when we voted in term limits and um um the last Charter review and I think two terms seemed like a good idea but I think if you've served on Council and then you're in a mayor's position then that changes things I the learning curve is not accounted for just some things that you know maybe we should take a look at it is all I'm saying I I'm not uh I'm not sure how I feel about it but I see both sides right because what happens in six years you know you're on Council for six years Leslie and no one steps up to take your spot and we can't get that chair filled I mean I don't know what's I really don't know what's gonna happen in that election when we can't fill the chair but how many when Mr Gunn left how many people applied to sit on Council we had what four they didn't have to run an election that was a little different yeah they still stepped up to Surf you know and and I think you I don't know so this is kind of my take on it is that all right if let's just say you're serving on the council all right and it's your first time you're you're going to be on the council with some people that have already been on there for at least a year or two all right and so you have to start building a relationship with them uh well then you run for mayor later and it starts all over again you don't know what you're doing whenever you are now going out because you you understand how this Council works but you don't understand how everything else works and so you go out there and Leslie can testify to this because she's done it you start building relationships and you start figuring out how people work and how they operate and and once you establish those relationships you have more power to to to benefit your community than you do just by yourself and so um it's something I would seriously like everyone to consider what I will say is that if we decide to do this I would like to make sure that I am not eligible that it would be this new the charter would go into effect as I left and because it's only it's the right thing to do wouldn't that impact everybody right now City attorney since they were all elected under so ongoing Charter um short answer I'd have to look at the language I I wasn't sensitized that we'd be having this discussion that way um we would have to look at that language of course when you're drafting Charter amendments you're legislating and we can write it how we want to write it um based on and ultimately what you know if you seek to have an approved what you think would be more favorable that way as well but not necessarily we would just it would in part be how we structure it and what we're looking at um I'm not intimately familiar with beyond the third term limitation what your term limit language president looks like okay but I didn't even think of what you brought up earlier which was um the inability of somebody who's in their final term is highly unlikely to be elected for a position within the county an officer position don't say within a county just say as an officer within because I don't want anyone to think that you know what I'm saying yeah so but there's some limitations there or just human nature you know when people are making a recommendation for somebody to take normally you're a Treasurer than your secretary and you're the chair or the or the president and it one or two year terms I would not be eligible at all right and so uh and not only that but they didn't know who I was when everybody first started so really a second term would be the only way to uh for Bel Air Beach to be fairly represented out uh throughout the county on these uh various committees would you agree with that Leslie yeah yeah I know that the mayor's luncheon I went to there were some County Commissioners there and they they're a good contact for us I mean but again you've gotta if you're just a year in and you don't know what you don't know you know it takes time to figure out your footing and what you're doing yeah yeah and and I will add that uh that the extra year uh because if you remember I I was put on The Big C the year before right this term began um it actually did give me uh a leg up uh whereas someone new coming in a new mayor they don't know anyone and so it actually bought me an extra year and we've made quite a bit of progress so uh it's just something to think about and uh I I know that the uh the the the size of the term also uh could possibly be impacted if you wanted to run elections during a regular election rather than yeah I don't know what the implications would be for poor Patty but uh not not bad then and mayor I I haven't looked at all the bills filed this session I know that the last two sessions the legislature has tried to compel all municipalities to conform that way so and again I'm not suggesting that will happen this session but we always have that added fun element of how we'll reconcile that if that Fiat should come down from Tallahassee and these are the same people that are wanting to bring in partisan uh partisanship and which is totally right enhanced Financial disclosures oh yeah this is going to be a very interesting session for municipalities and you'll be getting memoranda from me shortly on where the bills are standing now that we're about two and three weeks in the session yeah uh okay I think that that was all I had other than Kyle uh when do we begin the official budget season the end of this month I turn into uh to Heather or uh what the budget that I prepared and she kind of puts it all together um I believe I'll have to check the calendar I don't have it on me right now but I believe uh the start of May okay that I'm gonna issue that to you and start holding meetings individually okay great uh and um this is it and then everybody can go home uh I keep promising you updates on the beach nourishment and what's going on with it uh I met with Kelly Levy who is uh in uh in charge of a public works director okay so I spoke to her I had a had a long meeting with her and uh and I had uh Pat and uh bill with me and uh um is this Pinellas County yes okay yeah uh she is on board with the county funding the fully funding the project if we don't get a positive answer from uh from the Army Corps of Engineers and and uh various people in in DC um when is that deadline because isn't that approaching or hasn't that rich there's no deadline because they start moving that equipment in there's that we're we're not even fighting for a deadline right now we're fighting just to ever get it again okay and so we're already two years out because there's been no plans all right so we're gonna have to go through at least two more storm Seasons before we see so you're saying there's nothing going on there's nothing going on on Sand Key island not this year because people keep saying is it going to happen it's not going to happen I keep saying slim to no it's not going to happen so um because again they've not even they've not even begun planning for the project so um I've I have been meeting with all of the um the County Commissioners and you know one by one in fact tomorrow we're taking uh Chris labala to lunch and meeting with him and showing him how little beach there is uh down in North Readington Beach and uh trying to make sure that one by one that they're all they're all buying in and so whenever we're finally told they'll know you're not getting any of our money in the Army Corps of Engineers is not going to help I'm working diligently to get a firm commitment from the county from Pinellas County that they will 100 fund this project because we have the money they have 35 million dollars right now waiting to do something with it concerning Beach nourishment and um and that's our money we whether we like it or not these airbnbs and and all this traffic and everything that's going on we we sacrifice for that money and uh if we get that 35 million or whatever percentage if the state always kicked in another 20 percent I don't think that they will I don't believe that they will uh commit to anything unless the uh Army Corps has approved it so this is going to be all private this will be all Pinellas County doing it but we do have the money and the way that I'm approaching this and when I say we it not us the way that I'm approaching this is you're reinvesting and you're getting ready to spend millions and millions on these baseball complexes and new stadiums and all this uh you know hundreds of millions of dollars well what do you think got it all here it surely wasn't the middle of the uh of our Peninsula it was the beaches and so reinvest and put it back and uh and let's keep doing it and uh and so I'll let you know after at our next meeting I'll let you know how it goes or I'll contact you and send you an email that says hey you can share this with the council you can take them down to Sixth Street tomorrow I'll make a peanut butter jelly sandwiches for lunch and you'll see how there's no beach left there yeah yeah I know I know all right that's all I've got uh uh last chance to uh say anything else for this meeting otherwise uh I'm going to request some motion motion for German second anyone have a second back in all right all in favor all right thanks for being so patient and uh great meeting everyone"
