    "transcript": "let's get started it is now 602 and this is the city council budget workshop from the city of del air beach on june 20th at 6 02 pm let's do the pledge of allegiance [Music] indivisible [Music] councilmember frank banker council member leslie notaro here councilmember lloyd roberts here council member jody shirley council member mike zabal your vice mayor glenn gunn your mayor dave gattis city manager lynn reeves city attorney randy mora president all right thank you patty we have one item on our agenda tonight which is to discuss and review the fiscal year 2022 to 2023 budget everyone should have brought their draft budget that were distributed at the june 6 meeting and let's get started mr mayor yesterday in the roll call we've got to take you out of your position manager all right so we we have two packets here and what i'm proposing is a week we start off with city manager reeves giving us some instruction on what he has presented us thank you mayor council it's june 6 meeting we gave you this document which is the what the budget uh that's really what we'll be highlighting tonight uh we also gave you the high expense high revenue to low spreadsheet and then we gave you the details which for the most part i went over it with everyone told you that if you have any questions you can call me i didn't get any questions to speak up and this is just detail if you're when we're going through the budget you want to look back and say okay well what did we spend just paper one city council's budget what is uh contributions and donations well there's a listing there that talks about mayor's content and stuff like that so it's giving you more detail on what that line is in the budget under 511.52 so that's what this is so we'll start with page three and i'm not going to go through every single page page three i just wanted to highlight the organizational chart we've got one new physician in there an office assistant part-time to bring in to city hall that's to help out with the administrative functions in the offices a lot of times if you come in you see me patty laura or others taking care of the window and then administrative portion so we're asking for a part-time person to come in and help with that so that's the only new position everything else is the current budget is the same code enforcement is still shown with the sheriff i will tell you that sheriff's contract has not been updated into this yet but when we get the code of portion on this plane that it's going to go over a thousand so the funding for that office assistant that's that starts in one yes non-department when can we link in the city began advertising for that well you could you could advertise for it early and but then it wouldn't be effective a hiring date would be until october 1st okay perfect mr reeves can i ask you to get closer to your microphone or speak up struggling to hear you yeah when they're down here yes yes they're better when they're up there i understand it's how it's set up anyway okay okay the next page is page seven and i just want to highlight a couple things and as i said i went over a lot of this with all of you uh the next critical date for the city is july 1st the property appraiser will get the final taxable value i think everyone's aware that the taxable value went up 12.85 so next friday or july 1st a week from friday the property appraiser will give the final certification and then on the 18th of july city council will have a second budget workshop and special meeting to set the tentative millage rate and when you talk about setting the tenant of village rate it's not the final military but what we've done over the past few years we've recommended that you use 2.0394 keep the current village rate the same and this budget's built on the current military because you you could raise it higher but you know you can say like 2.13 is an example but whatever that village rate is set at you can't raise it higher later like in september when we have the final budget hearings so uh but over the last couple years we've left it at the 2.0394 so you can lower it but you can't raise the  i know what's the right now no no oh you're talking about the role that we have we're talking about two different things so what will happen after the county does the thing on july 1st there will be some numbers put into the trim forum which is with the department of revenue and that will give us those rollback numbers and rollback rate at that time so you'll see that but i would recommend that you keep the 2.0394 setting your tentative footage rate if later on you decide to lower it that's to a rollback rate or somewhere in between that's up to you but i wouldn't make it lower than the current military the initial the initial increase of those rate is astronomical right for our community yeah um i i am all for doing a tentative military and keeping it the same but i would like for us to beat this up i've already seen several things that are questionable not i think that they're seeping i'm just say they're questionable and i think that this council should be able to to correct some of the the overspending that is proposed and we would be very close uh with with the tax increases and going to a rollback rate we may actually be able to do it but it's going to take a lot of hard work on this budget to actually make that happen so that i just wanted to throw that out there because i really i think it's doable it just looks like it's uh it's very costly but we'll see where the chips fall okay so then in in september you'll have two meetings and that's where you really that's where you make the official village raid at those two meetings you'll have a first reading on the 7th of september of the proposed military and then the final one is on the 19th so those dates are those are really the critical dates there's some other things that have to be done uh submitting to the state when you do your final village if you'll move to page nine it's got the millage rates over the last few years and as you can see the dollar amount changed to 82 82 million increase over the prior year 12.85 and on we'll go to page 17. this budget is showing that increase in the millage rate will be 162 520 that's that's that's what the current taxable value millage rate leaving is is would produce 162 000 more than operating revenue uh everything else is pretty as far as revenue goes it's pretty statistical not much of that has changed as an example the utility service taxes there there's a little increase there but overall most of most of the items in revenue were stabilized uh rental registration that's something we talked about earlier that's that's what we've been running pretty much i think the other thing that we've got to look at is there's going to probably be a cost increase in the trash which i'll talk about a little later he has not given us that number yet uh the contract has four percent but waste management is going to ask for more than that because of the gas and stuff so they are going to come in with the propulsion as i said earlier we did have an increase in the sheriff of 5.1 so that that's a that's a cost that's going to be absorbed into this budget just a quick quick question um just attended a class last weekend and it came up in a particular conversation briefly on waste management and right now we have a truck that comes around they do a great job and we have two or three gentlemen or ladies that working on the truck i'm just curious which is more expensive for waste management that option or the option where the drug comes around and it's got the arm and they provide the garbage cans is that even an option well our current contract doesn't have that option okay so this contract is up in 23 so you'll be going out actually think next year to bid the trash again for volume years did they tell you what are the increases before because if they run on natural gas there's trucks he uh mr gresham who's the contact has contacted me and told me that he would be getting back with me because he was warning me that their contract which he currently says you get a four percent increase he was warning me that they are going to ask for more than the four percent because how it's set up in the contract is the cpi maximum of four percent that they were going to ask for additional uh monies because of the fuel and we actually put that out to uh like republic to see if uh they could match or do that well you're in a contract right now yeah i'm talking about if the contract what exactly like eight percent or something well you're you're you have a binding contract with with them the only thing i i guess you could probably do is say i'm gonna hold you in four percent uh i i would imagine you could do that that's more of a legal question that i would just kind of just as a reminder though the residents pay for that under a water bill it's not a direct charge it's just kind of a provider it does reconcile back to the resident and the city so well i understand because when it first checks i was afraid i didn't understand anything and you took the time but it is when the residents get the input the residents always pay okay okay so if we're getting a four percent increase it's fine all right can we hold it to four percent well legally the that would be a question for the city but that's what the contract says i have to see what the contract says concerning the ability to hold i can tell you that as a general matter of solid waste procurement is a time intensive process it's not something that's done easily and steadily done a year and a year and a half out i imagine that whomever maybe your next manager will probably begin that process regardless i understand that doesn't address this fiscal year the charges you're discussing but i'd have to look at the contract to answer your question regarding those payments i mean i've signed the checks too but when we're in the class last week some municipalities have went to charge cards where they can get the cash back and specifically they talked about using the charge card to pay their garbage fees in full is there any way that we can do that or is that allowed under the contract well the current contract we the it's built on the water sewer bill as is a stormwater fee so i don't really understand what with the credit where yeah right now i mean we're signing the checks correct we sign a check um getting rid of the check is going by credit card municipalities are you actually using charge card with cash back oh so that they're earning fees and those are a large cost you could recoup you know 10 20 000 in the large cases you wouldn't waste medical charges a fee use a credit card some news some don't that's why i asked about it it's in the contract we need to make sure we it's not in there for us are you serious at your own personal residence no no these cities actually will have a uh charge card specifically for all of the city expenses and as they use it for whatever services they're applying they're receiving cash back on that and that cash can be now that's generated into the general fund for use the city never pays the waste management bill that all comes from the resident personally that's what we said we paid bill it's the giveaway because i signed one of those chats [Music] yeah city city signs in chester just uh ron seganick donato i think what you guys are referring to in a commercial banker it's called a purchasing car so um a lot of municipalities will have a purchasing card and with that purchasing card based on volume there's a rebate to do that we made kicks in after about a million dollar annual spend but just to clarify that's that's what what you guys are doing while you're here can i ask you a question so many of these expensive services are charging a fee if you want to use a credit card so what's happening with these utilities such as garbage service you should all depends on how the contract is negotiated so um the attorney can probably review the contract to see what happens i know like with a lot of corporations that all we wanted to switch to maybe paying their cellular bill and att said no based on what most large companies att negotiates a rate that they won't allow a credit card or if you do allow a credit card you got to pay the fee the two percent or whatever the fee is so that's the you know that's what you have to look at differently is it gonna cost us two percent to run it through a mastercard and you're going to make about i don't know 50 basis points back so you'd be in a losing proposition if you actually paid the credit card fee but i think it just go it goes into part of your negotiation so when you go to negotiate next year with waste management and any other vendors in the city you can look at asia cities has that information they've had cities that do that that you currently need to contact and they may have a bank with a statewide program they do a great job of bringing bank solutions otherwise i can you know i'll get my citizen advisory committee together we'll run a process for you excellent yes vice mayor i mean it's a good idea and not to be lost even if it's not looking for large utility purchases but the government uses credit cards a lot we're doing supplies travel we get a lot of money a lot of money comes back to the government through credit cards and it makes transactions very easy the county becomes very easy because all you get is a monthly statement for office supplies okay so we'll go to page 18 if there's no questions this is more the revenue at the top more of the revenues such as the rentals within the community center those have increased over the past couple years i think aurora's done a great job of that following up and speaking to these people we've had the facility this year it's even increasing more we had some months that we had those weekend dates so it's it's it's a positive thing she's doing a great job with that the other things such as assessment searches that's just stuff on the house sales site plan review fees last year or in 2021 during the coven the review fees went bananas because everybody was remodeling or doing something but that faucet has slowed down a little bit now so the budget number there is about 15 000. miscellaneous revenue could be in anything realistically revenue for like the sale of the shirt or things of that nature then you go down to the next section that's a listing of the uh expenses uh by department which we'll go through those in somewhat of a detail the thing that you might want to look at and look at 380 which is just above those departments 380 dot 200 and the proposed budget would be taking 332 672 dollars out of the reserve fund to balance the budget so that's just under the current budget so if you went to the rollback rate just as an example you'd be taking 400 and almost five hundred thousand now so just just so you understand how that works okay uh going to age pages after that those are the city court budget on page 20. as i said you can look in the detail if there's any questions there or any things that you think we need to adjust as it went up you know in any great amount of money i am recommending the five percent pay increase for all employees and this is the first employee though so uh but pretty much it's uh her expenses are pretty close to what they they were this year but that's because we're not having an election this year right yeah if we had an election they would it would have gone up probably last year uh i want to say it was 3500. approximately yes yeah so there's no election plan this year so the uh the salary is really the only increase yes from the most part yes salary you're going to have a little bit of increase in that's that's pretty much standard every year and i'm a little confused about insurance insurance is going in like crazy everywhere why why isn't it going up for you well we we have minimal employees and it's pretty stabilized but there's actually right now there's only three arrivals yeah yeah because you've got a new employee probably worse but there's traditionally been four employees on the city's insurance and i'm just giving example if you paid my insurance you'd be paying similar to what addie says nineteen thousand dollars a year you're you're paying seven hundred about sixteen hundred dollars which is great well you're single yeah yeah but you're giving me 600 to take care of my insurance and things so that's been a benefit all of them in my term kyle's doing the same thing his wife has a policy so that's a benefit to the city that's 10 000 bucks that how's getting back to the city and uh or will be well he is already so that kind of gives you uh it brought up one question and it goes really hard in the discussion about the future city mayor of future city manager page 22 that showing us a cap of 106 000 we cannot exceed that i thought we were talking about potentially increasing that which we call for changes in the budget you wanted to know about how high can we go with a new city manager what's the upper end of our budget and this is showing me our upper end is no more we can't pay a new city manager any more than 106k we we're in the middle of going through this budget and we will have hired someone before we actually set the final budget that's going to say that's also a proposed budget number i mean i don't think you'll also find two hundred thousand dollars in here for a stormwater bid increase even if it's projected established in the budget it's based on what when i get paid in the i will tell you if you're looking at page 22 your insurance cost is probably going to go up once you hire a city manager it's unproportional yeah but it's some proportion we're gonna say that's a key point though when you write it down hey you know we need to review right hold up see if we want to watch it this is equitable and obviously that's going to be situational with who you hire and what his credentials are right well we'll have to come back to it but if you hired kyle and gave the five percent raise which we just gave the pay raise today we're still saving what five thousand dollars off of this nice nice pitch i think that's kind of early since we are advised to do a thorough due diligence approach to hiring the city manager right we'll have that conversation on thursday don't forget thursday so just one quick question i know in my previous life when we were going through budgets if i had for example this on page 21 where we have the operating expenses there so if i had an adopted budget in 2122 of 27 000 but i only spent 16 but summarize actual adopted budget yeah so i would be asked why am i increasing that line item you know by another percentile this budget's based on council members attending you know paddy makes this budget and it's if you go back to the detail it's based on uh projections as an example you just went to emo right it's projecting three attendees go to ema okay okay uh it's projecting two attendees go to emo advanced all of that is built into here uh the only thing that really majorly increased in this was the video taping because that that number has increased but we are going to be talking to victor actually following i'm trying to get a meeting with him before i leave to resolve since the zoom seems to be working pretty good do we need to videotape plus the zoom um you're spending you know depending on the hours of the meeting that's how he's paid so it may be better now that we've got a more robust system to say well we'll just use this as the videotape and maybe hire victor as the moderator of that which kyle is doing right now so that's that's a discussion so how it's built is it's based on what the city clerk is projecting uh mostly things that you go do like emo or the florida cities or the suncoast league of cities there's some flooding in here for that [Music] there's some expenses in here for the league of mayors sometimes the mayor is one to be a member of it other times the mayor said no i i don't so don't pay the news okay uh the florida beaches and uh shores that is something that was very important for victory nourishment and you know i know that some of the previous council members went to that because it's a kind of a coalition to promote to promote the beach republic so that's that's kind of how it's uh okay and like you had said earlier mr mayor that you know we can look at all these different fly items um again i know in one of my previous slides the governor would just say i want everything about five percent um and that's tasking sometimes like in kyle's world when you're talking about cutting maintenance five percent everything's getting older the maintenance doesn't go down that's right so to be asked to cut maintenance 50 is often very challenging some of these things you know we may be able to get creative you know look at some of these things like you know travel to the um like the classes we just went to right but i think and there is value in going in those in person where she'll meet other people there and make contacts all that neat stuff but some of these things we may be able to see what's available online in lieu of possible travel and working on the will have the same classes that are closer they generally have a tamper class that may happen orlando also you went to the first one which was in jack jackson and but they do have others and sometimes they come around okay just south of sarasota right yes sir he raised a valuable point and i'll make an observation here we're going through a multi-million dollar budget right now and we're still getting lip service to reviewing the strategic plan you don't know what the priorities are you don't know what the assumptions are that would have been very clear and would help us go through the budget process if we had to sit down and spend some time saying these priorities still match what we want to do and then how do these budget line items align with strategic priorities what are the assumptions what's going to happen to the economy what's going to happen to property values the cost of infrastructure and stuff like that so we're kind of going through a budget right now kind of like feeling our way through this thing i think the the goal of tonight is to go through this and go through the uh the fine details and then pick on things that we want to debate further and see where they do alive but this is pretty much the introduction it takes a while to get through just this to see what what the city manager is proposing once we go through this we can certainly start debating all right what do we need to change and what do we like what do we dislike and what does not work within the strategic plan that's my two cents on it i just think that process is backwards i think you do that before you go to a budget rather than come back and say okay well let's make the strategic plan the the city budget is always proposed by the city manager and then it's up to us to go through it and decide whether we like something about it or not okay 23 page 23 that's the finance department there is an increase to uh buy some accounting software that's proposed uh we're still we've put a budget number of 20 000 in there we're still reviewing different software programs and it could be that after we go down the road a little further maybe we keep what we got with the uh quickbooks but we're looking for a more related government software program as opposed to a business program like quickbooks so that's there's a there's a twenty thousand dollar stipulation other than that the department really is negligible other than the three three percent increase for the accountant that is in his agreement i did notice that uh you also had quickbooks listed in the budget uh whenever you drill down into the departmental detail so yeah so both pieces of software are in there and that's something i'm sure we'll discuss as well yeah as we get down to the yeah we've talked to a couple vendors already but we haven't got drilled them down to what is this really going to cost us because i can tell you for the one guy that gave us the budget number a few months ago [Music] which is the twenty thousand dollars when we've talked to a couple other vendors it's been significantly more than that and at this point we may need to put a savings account together is there any reason we cannot work with other communities in sharing resources this might be one of those things where the economies of scale is definitely affect us but we can cooperate with the other beach communities using the same system just increase the number of users i don't know how they would relate that really because it's it's licensed by address i don't know how that knowing licensed by the organization and if we have an organization maybe it will currently license under that and have a lower user cost that's possible i mean we do that we do large my organizations are hundreds of visitors so there's no reason we can't with other communities that are not the same size they're using the same functions receivable account generation well unfortunately around here every one of them's got something different some of them are outdated at this time maybe it's not yeah so and i don't know how the software companies would handle that so that's a question maybe we could ask one of the vendors i can tell you for the size of this organization twenty thousand dollars sounded like a lot of money yeah yeah way over the top yeah well we've got some numbers of fifty thousand dollars for the size of this organization that software guys were debating like they're way more stable okay i'm i'm liking quickbooks more and more everything [Music] are there are there like one or two or three things off the top of your hand that we're not able to get well it's it's it it's more a user program to build stuff and that's what the accounting people that we have are doing they're building [Music] it's it's not like a what do i say i'll use it as budgeting it's it's not a government budgeting software do they have a cost for how much they're charging you for that i mean this may be an affordable house compared to a new software program what having whatever they're doing to quickbooks maybe more affordable than buying and training well we believe we are talking to quickbooks about the possibility of upgrading to a cloud-based uh and hopefully it's it's a better system but those are things that we're in the process of doing so it's going to get adjusted one way or the other anything else on page 23 you'd like these guys because everything else is pretty stable the i.t most of that is computer software hardware the things that we have to do like the internet we pay for that contractual services we have a gentleman dave pallett that's kind of our i.t guru if we have a problem he helps us with that there is some money set aside to update computers and we rotate that within the city so that's pretty much what that is and as you see it's it's pretty much stabilized would you refresh my memory mr reeves what made us a job i can't remember why we jumped so high on contractual services between 20 fiscal year ending 2021 and 20 and then [Music] uh i don't know what happened from 20 to 21. i don't have it in front of me unfortunately because he must jump and i thought maybe that was a temporary increase and it's continuing to grow but this time it's slower so whatever happened i'll have to get back to you that was on page 24. yeah it's 24 and it's in technology the domain name registrations that's an annual fee that we pay the internet right now we pay a little over a hundred dollars a month per investment yeah domain costs are hurry yeah uh constant contact uh we pay a fee to the web hosting the people that host our website uh the consultant that's david we could spend that we could not spend it just depends uh if there's anything now when you get down to 5 17 05 21 those things are the microsoft licenses the norton trend micro china micro and the we've had put a thousand dollars in there for cloud storage to take some of our stuff and put in the cloud as opposed to trying to keep it here on a server it brings up i mean just looking ahead quickly the printing and binding i thought the whole purpose of the ipad initiative was basically that the slash the protein binding costs eventually that's what the plan is you won't you'll get your agenda online and you won't get a paper copy that's that's what the intent was but uh we're transitioning to that slowly so the 3800 assumed it would be still going to transition all of next year or say halfway through or finishing that transition i would think you know i understand there could be a potential happening on that cost yeah okay the next one is not departmental page 25. you're already ahead of me in printing and binding you're on the next page okay the salaries are here uh this is includes the part-time position that's why it went up uh about twenty thousand dollars uh lynn i have a question who is the mileage or the car allowance for uh it is for laura and she does the bank deposits 1200 worth yeah she goes every day to the bank works out you know it's 100 a month it works out if you think about it it's one gallon in case about that are we handling that much cash if you need daily deposits i mean thousand dollars a day i didn't see it but five it depends on the day some days it's ten months and the next day it's two thousand some days it's twenty thousand data bank who is getting uh who's actually doing that job right now since in this current year there is no budget for her mileage reimbursement i was doing it most of the time and and uh because i've been gone in and out i've given her a car allowance to you know i've adjusted her thing so she's got something this year for a few months but well it'll be like the last four months of the year let me talk about maybe reducing the frequency of those so and she does other she goes other places that she uses her car for she goes and gets duplicate copies of prints things of that nature out of the office let's see [Music] we did increase the legal services but in this budget but we may want to adjust that backwards a little bit we haven't had only a couple months of the new situation and that's really going to depend on you know keeping the money what it is professional services other and that's if we want to hire a consultant to do something outside of our normal engineering things as an example we put that as a placeholder a year ago we spent a thousand bucks it could be something like one year we we hired a lady to do the personnel policy and rewrite the job descriptions and we paid for that so we've just kept that as a placeholder typically it's never [Music] how many other placeholders do we have this is kind of like a um you had placeholder money well you know you're not really going to use it so guess what i got money in the budget and i can move over here for something else so well why don't you contingency rather than a placeholder to say something comes up you bring it before the council and we authorize you to take contingency money out of it you could do that you could do that you could say no we're not going to put any money in okay so the question is is there how many places do we have all the money and i mean what's the bottom line for the most part there is no other placeholder in here this is based on expenses that we have and you know as an example an estimate of the insurance increase the preparers of maintenance things of that nature the things that that are happening so there aren't that's only a placeholder because at various times during the year the consulate said and it happened with i'm going to use the personnel the council that here said i want this person to to look at this one time the council said uh i want to what was that oh the grants the council asked for an outside consultant to come in and tell us if we were eligible for grants so i mean you could reduce it so i get that so i guess i understand we're going hey this is the trend the previous year we spent a thousand dollars and then we have a uh propose of 10 10 times that so if you had a footnote down here explain what you projected the increased cost is going to be that's fine i can understand it otherwise you go with something come out every day so stuff going on 10 15 20 percent we could we can adjust it find that that's what i was referring to earlier about the challenges that i was exposed to yeah where someone would say hey you only spent a thousand now you're asking for 10 we're not giving it to you so anyway yeah like you said we can review it sure uh that two questions at the bottom by 1905.30 parking meter expenses i thought those were all purchased or was this a uh those are maintenance maintenance contracts with them and uh there are some costs that that you know as a part breaks we have to pay for something okay and then the uh the library services this is the reimbursement of citizens yeah we budgeted that how much have we actually spent well uh i can't tell you where we're at this year you can see two years ago it used to be we paid 100 right and the console three years ago said no we're going to pay 50 well i can tell you that upset a lot of residents and i guess some people decided because previously we were spending twelve thirteen thousand dollars a year when we were given the whole hundred dollar reversal but we cut it as you can see we cut it in half sixty five hundred last two years ago we spent three thousand dollars in that so are we reimbursing fifty percent or a hundred percent fifty percent numbers we were reimbursing about 130 residents and so right now we're i mean at 50 we're pushing a year and a half ago during the pandemic we put out uh basically 58 residents that's who came in and wanted reimbursed for their dollar amount 2 900 bucks and then forecasted 65 so i mean it's a potential area to look at yeah 15 the same percentage but i mean right now it didn't tail off we had a lot we we did take a lot of uh adding to tell you too we took a lot of indigestion from residents about the council reducing it but now the change has been made for a couple years right now you still well knowing you still get complaints i think it was a good move though because how many people obviously 50 again would come in and say no it's free money i'll get a library card and never ever use it i think people are doing that and i'm scared i would like to to see an audit from the library to see how many of our residents are actually using it can that be done i don't know if that's a good idea i don't know if you could you'd have to have some kind of i don't know how they handled the library cards did they assign it to bellar beach or because what we require is you as a person going individually pay your hundred dollars bring us the receipt we'll give you fifty dollars whether there's a stand there yeah and they just go by zip codes and we'll punia zip code give me the numbers okay you got 20 active cards and then and they can go to two or three different libraries they can go to clearwater they can go to largo uh where's another library they could go to semicolon so they're paying the money up front yes and then we we're reimbursing send them a check for that they're definitely doing something at the library yeah okay yeah and that that may be my smear is talking about it dropped from 130 to 58. you know while i'm not doing this i'm not that might be because of kobe didn't want to go again that could be we don't really we're this will be this year once we get through it will be the first and they what they do is they renew them throughout the year so the number one number i mean not that much the schema but just to see where we're at right now okay we can find that out library reimbursement let's find out uh nothing else really on that page to unless there's a question then we go to age 27 this is the code enforcement budget and we we set it up for a four percent increase it's 5.1 percent uh this is for a thousand forty hours a year which is twenty hours per week uh i don't know where the console's at with this i think twenty hours a week is is a little excessive i've said that before and if you look at your reports recently the activity is not you know there's not 20 items happening every day i think he's proven that there's a new sheriff in town and he's become very efficient and while others have wise enough i did speak with lynn about something he had proposed about a year ago or maybe regarding moving it back to laura so from a cost-cutting standpoint especially considering that we're hiring the halftime person to come in and help with the administrative tasks i did briefly talk to her to see what her thoughts were and it sounded like she would be amenable to that as long as we were able to bring an additional office and person on board and again lyndon told me that he had proposed that before and the current leadership at that time um didn't want to go in that direction although it was a cost savings yes so we're looking for cost savings uh and again when i was talking to some of the citizens around here unsolicited more than several people voiced to me that they would prefer um the previous individual than being laura as opposed to the sheriff disturbing me well i was on that council when we voted to keep the sheriff's department in there a couple of reasons the lawyer doesn't have a badge she can't enforce the wall by when the sheriff goes up and starts questioning a resident he's not getting the truth he says i'm going to re-question you but now you may be under a felony of law if you remind this the truth comes out um i think the best i think we get a big bang for our quality questions and the sheriff's department i've talked to a lot of residents too they love seeing the sheriff yeah different opinions i yeah i don't think sheriff should be pushing at all he has no right authority to question any citizen period unless suspected of a crime not a violation of uh progress well because if they're in violation of the ordinance it is a crime not rising to the level that would hold up important all right i will tell you i would tell the sheriff the vaccine well you can and then you'll go to the next proper procedure but what happens when you just have a regular city employee doing it back and forth yeah you know i'm in total support of looking at alternatives to the sheriff and uh you know doing code enforcement i think the current deputies do a great job but in the past i've never been in support of having the sheriff knocking on someone's door because their grass is too high and i'm a big proponent of code enforcement but i think there's a way to handle it with residents and i don't think the sheriff is necessarily the most effective way mr goodwin i've been a proponent of a sheriff showing up in uniform and i'm not sure it's a necessary effective way to do it i think there are other ways the city manager proposed reorganizing it and what the vote came down to the pushback had nothing to do with the badge it had everything to do with personalities and the person who was involved in the job at the time that's where the pushback was and arguments were made about hey you know let's have a law enforcement guy there let's have the city uh code enforcement person do it which is more cost beneficial we thought we could do the job the city managers watched it both ways and he proposed a reorganization that was going to save the sacred and involved [Music] topic and the main reason the only reason why i did not vote to bring it back in-house was because the only option we were given was laura to be the the code enforcement officer and i will stand behind this i don't believe that she's the right person for that job i don't have anything against her i just think that that someone if we're going to do this i would like to see someone else other than lauren do it because she was doing that in the past and there was obviously a reason why we even considered changing and outsourcing those services so for whatever reason if it was a management issue or if it was the person or or just something was the combination was not correct so i i would be more than happy to to bring it back in the house but it's going to have to be someone else before i know it that way mr mayor uh the laura was doing it was she doing it seven days a week like we have the deputy now he called an hsc i don't remember the details because we've had uh we've outsourced for oh she wasn't doing it well he's not doing seven days ago well no he what i'm saying you'll see him on a saturday you'll see him on a sunday occasion she was doing some saturdays and sundays okay but i i mean he's not here every saturday no i didn't say that i mean he rotates it uh which is good yeah you have to look at the you know the cost next year is going to be 50 and 49 cents an hour which translates into about 54 000 because when i got the number right so i guess we had a i guess with a four percent upgrade we covered the cost in this budget but i'm not proposing doing either or what i'm saying is i don't think you need code enforcement 20 hours a week didn't our deputy save a way to be using a cpr training not that i'm aware of i thought they did not so real quick so what is mars involvement because i know she is still like the code divorcing person goes out there and shares something up [Music] 22nd street i'm in favor of retaining the contract for code enforcement you may want to adjust the hours i want to give you a personal experience about a one-on-one with the current code enforcement officer earlier in the spring i had my flat roof replaced with a sloped flat roof had to prove it there was a dump trailer in my driveway had the contractor's name on it but the gentlemen who were doing the work used their personal vehicles didn't have any signage to include the name of the company and the license of the company the officer stopped he knew maybe from delivering cac packets and so forth we had a chat and he said you got a permit i kind of left and i said yes sir i do took it over to him and anyway his demeanor towards the contractors was polite it was professional i'm going to emphasize non-confrontational it's all about how you approach people his predecessor was the same way and i've been observing since we've been getting the monthly reports on code enforcement the increase in red tag permits of unauthorized unpermitted work in this community i'm standing here telling you if you want to cut the hours fine don't stop using the deputy thank you thank you all right back to you mr roberts was asking about when the baton is handed off from the code enforcement officer okay currently laura she has several things she does yes yeah the sheriff does not provide administration for code enforcement okay they basically bring in the is an example of i'll pick up frank i'm going to send him a letter and tell him his palm tree the front needs trimming then all the code guy does is telling the address and where it's at and then laura writes up the letter with the types that prepares it mails it out magistrate hearings same situation she does all that she does the uh cold liens every month she does the you know the opening on that stuff okay so she does all the administrative work and maintains the files that's what she does mr goodwin code enforcement's made some strides and improvements and some things but only twice in recent history have we really ever gone in to reduce the data how long tickets are staying open what are the major areas that are being affected by code enforcement we don't know if we're getting better reverse recovery of course i mean it's time we need to sit down and come up with a focus group or something and say what is it we want out of code enforcement and how do you know if you're getting better or worse because that may drive the ability for some hybrid any for short term we try reducing the number of hours of a badge working increasing the hours for larger and see if what happens there something in between some hybrid thing but until you know whether you're getting better or worse with the code anyone else on this topic the next one we are already really talked about the garbage and trash uh there again is a four percent increase that's in here uh with the we haven't got those final costs that they're going to recommend and i will give with the city attorney and give him a copy of the contract and let him take a look and see what he his thoughts are what our limitations are waste management and i think everyone here would say it does a great job they pretty much take anything and everything and when we went through the contractual cycle uh 2018 [Music] they were the higher bidder but the city maintained them because they were very happy with them so that's just and i'm going to make a comment on the uh the automated grabber arm that lit our arms that lift the waistband up i think that would require us to rent similar events we would have to obtain a standard uh and also that luxury of being able to just put anything on the curb and suddenly magically disappears at 10 o'clock on a monday or thursday that would go away also yeah we would require everyone to take things physically to the dunk where today we don't have yeah so these are things to consider and that's a good point because we all have shrubbery and we've got any stream there's piles you know when when it's the controller type of situation they may have they'll have a bin for trash and they'll have a bid for recycling if you want an extra bin for trash you're going to pay an extra fee for that and i i don't think you're going to get like look at my friend yeah well even when i lived next door to break you know i threw my trees and i'd have a pile out here like this and guess what it's coming monday morning who my father was bigger believe roberts you had a company um i was just thinking back where the previously we had the truck come by with the arm and i'm pretty confident we did put um debris out there it just had to be no bigger than four feet what will what do you expect to hear back from police services i i left a message for him today because i hadn't heard from because he talked to me before i left and said he was going to be getting back with me with the numbers that's why i'm trying to push that number situation well mr mayor when you're talking about the bike occur this is about seven years ago because i was only here i've been hearing waste management told the citizens of this town that they had to bundle their tom branches and everything like that i think that lasted three weeks because no one responded no it doesn't it does not happen right right that's what i'm saying so i mean they are an excellent service and the guys on those trucks are excellent and whenever they come around at christmas time i hope everyone remembers yeah absolutely they're great they know you raised a good point about you later yeah they may not be so great if they jacked the right way up but let's just wait and see what happens right any any other discussion on this page okay page 29 this is public works and there again i propose the five percent uh the car allowance is in there for uh whoever the public works person uh is for next year it's piled then his this car allowance is in there uh going down let me wait hold on one second you said the car allowance and what is the flex pay that's you said that was for insurance yeah okay and so we really don't have a maybe it's in the detail but we don't do we have a break out of that in the final on the flex pay the flex pay versus car allowance all right flex pay is uh 600 a month okay that's when when you're looking at this this isn't just kyle this is everybody every public works so you're not just looking at kyle's and the other thing you have to look at is part of this we take 15 of this of the public works salaries and things that have moved them to the stormwater fund because they do stormwater things so you can't take that as a delicious public works so in this budget the community service administrator part of his salary as i said is in stormwater so if you look on the detail it breaks each of those things car allowance is 3 300 for next year and where's the flex pay flex pay is an well insurance showing up in uh account 541.0161 [Music] with car allowance why they would be on the same line it's not third line that's a typo that needs the flex pay needs to come out of there should not be there yeah okay and uh my spear gun you have a question i'm not quite sure how many car amounts is in there but at what point does it become more cost effective to lease or own another city that was that was the question i was going to ask well that's you mean to purchase a car for every leasing [Music] all the time another another question are all of these recipients of carl outs are they maintaining the proper insurance that will keep us from being sued say if they get an accident well we have our our personal insurance identify the city of them yeah i think it's it's uh it's different whenever you're in their vehicle and they have to maintain their own insurance at a higher level than what standard insurance policy would be we require a certain a higher level i think it's 300 000. and then there's something else i was going to add to that if it was another stipulation i can't remember what it was now but that was the main thing was that uh we insurance stipulation yeah we we just try to make sure that it can't come back on us if they get an accident in their own vehicle while doing something for us and our insurance company actually requires that the other thing was to make sure that if they are driving their own vehicle they also have to have a clean product record otherwise they're at risk and your insurance company will come back only for the house so these are just things to consider because we always want to reduce risk as much as possible whenever we're dealing with these cars possibly the rental car or the lease would change a lot of that but not all of it but we would still have to make sure that everyone's driving right now that brought up that following one of the rentals and leases that jumped 42.9 percent uh rentals and visas since we're talking about vehicles jumped up 42.9 that's 541.04 [Music] why not in there that is 541-4444 so we do these vehicles no this is just special no this is rental of mainly equipment like we we have to change a good example is changing the batteries for the street lights and we have an outage on in bdi we have to rent something because we don't have the equipment to get up there  well no it's a lift usually shrimp trees trim trees things of that nature yeah that's just rental equipment just kind of threw me into a 50 increase over a year it seems higher but at least it's not a place that's not much no it's a rental equipment just to rent the lift for a week or per day it's like seven hundred dollars i think about two to three hundred dollars plus the delivery oh yeah you get a 150 each wave yeah so these funds are actually pre-assigned disaster response so these are pre-fema uh i mean are we getting any are there any funds available from the state or local counties that may be able to assist themselves like the disaster supplies emergency response if those are used wouldn't they be built against an emergency and the females later on faces back okay where are you at now i just went down through five just for the sake of organization can we continue moving downward not not jumping to the bottom because if there there's other things ahead of it and you know kind of excellent okay what's the question now we'll just go back to whether the mayor said where we should be at i was out of line we're still on public works okay yeah we're at public works and i think we just discussed rental releases and uh and the only reason why i stopped was because i had something about fuel but someone else may have something higher up on the list i'm just trying to go down the list rather than jumping all around go ahead mike no no i did go back to you okay fuel check uh treat me all right i'm sorry not fuel check but operating let's see where we're going here operating supplies operating supplies is 541 520 and that includes fuel and tools herbicides irrigation okay so how can with the recent cost increases in fuel how can the budget be almost exactly the same are we not spending that money this year no we're spending it but what we've got estimated in the next year's budget is about 3500 it's just we didn't see this coming whenever this budget was set and it was set at 21 000 and now you're only asking for 250 more dollars right at this point that's all right [Music] and we're not even well we're almost okay yeah i see where you're going with this you know we just just so you're aware a lot of these things we don't just go out and spend the money because you give it to us i understand that's we've never done that at all and i mean [Music] there are increases in fuel there are increases in the could be in the fertilizer program and that's the product area for credit card use you're the price that's the number one person yep that's right uh mr disabled you were discussing emergency response supplies oh yeah the emergency response applies normally items like that uh conceivables during an emergency fema can you know repay some of the expenditures like they do so is that counting the reimbursement or is that totally outnumbered to be seen again what we have to do is we have to as an example that money's out there for sandbags and sand and we we budget for that now if there's no hurricanes we don't spend it but fema doesn't reimburse for sand and they don't reimburse for sandbags they what we do as an example i'll use the hurricane in 2017. the city that year spent about 125 000 overall we got reimbursed about 120 000 of that money that was for debris removal we lost the roof on the house back here we lost all our signs in the city and pretty much they were popped in half if you lived here and you remember that uh let's see i'll put money back for senator sanders right no they didn't they didn't give us anything but you've not increased the budget no we're not increasing the budget that's not a name storm and there's no damage you're not getting you're not getting anything that's a load of sand costs now look at that [Music] [Music] yeah we can give you actual versus budgeting i'll call it an income expense statement i'm going to show you it's going to be a busy week for you isn't it at all and they don't give us anything mid-year anymore like they used to give us reports all yeah well she's with the budget and the audit i will tell you i was very frustrated with the audit this year because every other year that audit has been finished by march that auditing salt marsh had a lot of problems with personnel so they asked for a 60-day extension that was may and you didn't we didn't get the audit until june well like it's very that's the problem that you can't really you can't really gauge where you're at without all the evidence that's right that's the problem yeah so we're uh but staffing's a problem everywhere yeah it wasn't so cautious it wasn't salt marshes it was the issue that the girl that used to come to our meeting janine she left decided oh i'm leaving and that was in uh i want to say like two weeks before it was supposed to be ready she left the company they had a lot of problems this it would be cool if every time a service or a company wasn't able to deliver that we got to break our cost there because it seems like everyone is charging you the full price regardless right maybe we should adjust our contracts to match performance-based contracting right here right mr gun okay the next uh wait i have a question about capital outlay are these savings plans the 8 000 and the 14 000. yeah you're going to see the capital outlay on page 31. okay thank you okay uh parks and rec there's a little bit there but not any thing of any consequence really uh recording stopped all right we're back and uh i appreciate everyone uh giving me a break and uh uh i i would like to add what mr hamburg said we're not seeing financial data published on the way of any work it's very little of it and all of these documents should be online even though they're large we should be able to go and download because it doesn't take long and and they're already electronic so let's let's get them let's get them drawn online and uh if you go if you go to the website right now and go to finance and look at the documents that are available for download there's so much stuff they say that really it should be part of our public record so we're not having the scrounge to find it because i don't want to keep up with tons of paper for the rest of my life well i was on this website today would be the thursday is it at 11 p.m [Music] during a special announcement where yes all meetings every single meeting no matter what kind of meetings goes to 11 8 p.m because if i put six o'clock anticipate at a time that's when it will drop off the website as long as the start time is correct yes yes sir and i notice that the calendar invites they spill on top of each other like today yes there's a conflict but that's right as long as the start time is so it's at six pm thursday or yes oh uh yes thursdays at six pm what's thursday night it's not it's not been published yet because we're waiting for some detail uh some feedback from the council but everyone has the calendar and it shows that day as where we're meeting so it's just not not being sent out on for our electronic calendars yet okay uh where are we at mr reeves 31. okay on 31 these are proposed capital program expenditures uh there's basically savings accounts until we get to a point where we need to replace something or as an example the exterior painting of city hall we put money aside every year instead of having a big budget number in one year i did have a question with that which is relatively large um looking at that item beyond one yet beyond fy 2027 for 9 000. yet over here we just said fy 2027 3 000 i mean no that's the collection right now we don't anticipate having to paint the exterior city at all for over another five years so that that's accumulating beyond is accumulation when the next budget comes out that number will drop to thirty thousand it just what that beyond number is what the final cost will cost us as an example if you go down to the see more it's it's got 9000 saved in prior year it's got six more thousand the final number is 15 000. okay on the same page uh the the only thing that's really is like the beach uh beach access improvements we have a savings account last year we spent fifty thousand dollars on the doing long borders we got 50 000 from pinellas county okay no i understand that then i am confused um your total 42 000 on the detail page should match that total on exterior painting with city hall they should be the same 33 000. on what page okay i'm looking at page 32 and 31. 32 is the detail about the painting of the community so yeah and you're saying a total of forty two thousand dollars yet you're saying total of thirty three thousand on the previous page yeah the okay that's a good fine we'll get that corrected okay i saved some money so which one is correct the top one is correct 31 page 31 or 32 31 because it's about 50 000 to paint this building it says beyond 2027 that's why it goes up to 42 000. it it shouldn't he's using the totals the total shouldn't be no they should match as an example the next the carpet you go to the next one it matches the next bank yeah every sheet should match the total number together so we'll go back through those and verify that they're making sure they're matching uh going down uh some of the other pieces of equipment like the john deere tractor we just bought that probably three years ago so it's got a 20-year life cycle so it's it's broken for 20 years right now or probably 17 now uh the community the truck and the small truck and the large truck that money is to replace them and they're 10 plus years old for me too some of yous were on console when we had the little uh that truck was ranging from rangers and it was shape and it was probably 14 or 15 years old when we finally got rid of them i'm starting to go through these you got quite a few errors i mean the budget on the police same thing did it drop okay thanks thanks for the catch we'll get yeah okay the summary page is missing the beyond yeah whole column is that beyond numbers it looks like a compilation of multiple [Music] so that we don't have to sit here and try to do nothing well now that of course we expect this but knowing that changes are coming i think we discussed this last year there is no date or rev number on these pages so if this gets near one of the other ones it will contaminate it with the original so yeah any corrections the new documents we receive a light seed base put on the bottom on every page in red if possible okay the next page we'll go to is the capital projects fund expenditure which is on page 46. and that those things we've got money set aside for things like we had money a couple years ago for tennis courts the bow ramp that's currently being done so it's going to drop off it'll it will go away there's nothing in next year's budget we've got a savings account for morgan park for the resurfacing of the parking lot there and there behind that there is a sheet with the out years and we'll go back through those to make sure they're all okay i talked to you earlier about uh adding small kayak uh floating peers that i don't seem to see these anywhere we we didn't that we of course put that money in docks 100 knocks yeah because that's what it would be located in the city single and uh yeah so at this point uh something that i really want to talk to you about is boulevard beautification at your seat tonight you'll remember a couple months ago duke gave us new numbers and i went back to them arguing that i thought they were too much and did we get the credits and they've given us an updated number for the two phases they as an example phase one which is through causeway it went down 206 thousand dollars so i know at bei we got some credits back it was like i don't say a hundred thousand and that's absolutely spent to run it all the way to the 22nd street at the time so at this point in time uh the city let's see is under here right now uh through this current year we've got 3.3 million 1.3 we're going to get a another 900 000. be clear these are the two letters of the energy reference yeah i gave you a copy of the old letter to show you that hey that's the owner i collected there and gave me some credit so that's a positive thing so um what was the second number you said 930 426 will get in the next fiscal year which totals about 2.2 million total 1.3 is that include the stormwater that we moved over stormwater money that we were going to put towards no no no no this is just for underground she's doing great yeah that's what the fed do no we're not talking about the cave i'm talking about right just built boulevard underground you said you were short in the budget and we're going to move somebody over oh okay okay we were going to take some what the cac recommended was take some of the storm water money in future budgets and move that over to do the whole project uh we're still about nine hundred thousand to a million dollars short how can you use storm water fines no no we're not going to touch the store storm what i'm saying is the what they recommended was to take the 800 000 that we're getting from the american rescue and feed that into the stormwater fund and not take money from the reserves and put in the stormwater fund to use that for the environment so i understand tomorrow but we're still 900 000 sure now how much of okay we're 900 000. and you know we had this discussion we're only a hundred thousand do that move of stormwater 8000 american rescue right we're getting eight hundred thousand yeah okay i see what you're saying from american restaurant we're gonna pull 800 000 out of the money that's in reserve for storm water and replace it with the 800 000 here from american question and that and they were another short another hundred yes we're only sure a hundred thousand dollars and american rescue money is that the covet money that was available okay because my question was again back to that conference that people were going hey we got loads of money from all these pro haven't you applied for it yet so we have applied no we don't you didn't apply it was like it's kind of like that child tax credit he didn't ask for the child that did it it was uh [Laughter] so just to clarify though health boulevard undergrounding between the money we're getting from baylor shore and our money we've got about 4 million at the time our original number it was about nine hundred thousand dollars short based on the cost they went up a little bit but not as bad as the second initiative duke gave us and said well you know for burst through causeway it's going to cost you one point 335 000. now they're down to 1 million 129 000. now that's providing the supplies and that's not providing the person that does the instagram board we would sub that out separately which is another 700 000 roughly for the first phase i haven't got a number for the second phase since we got these new numbers uh what i would suggest that we will be able to jump off the to my understanding of branding problems indian rocks each did a rfp for underground services and it was awarded to utility consultants and speaking to them you should be able to use that contract and jump off that and be up you know use use the same contract so the numbers stay the same these dupe numbers based on this or good until december 11. okay for now i haven't got the final total numbers during utility consultants but i've got report for the first phase which is about seven hundred thousand two she believed that we can have the entire package if anything the final numbers prior to certain dates that we'll get this into this budget cycle that money's budgeted in there regardless the 900 deals from the county because it's kind of a you pay the bill and send the invoice in and they give it back to you so it's like a short-term loan to pay for the bill the county is real good about reimbursing that i mean everything that we've ever got reimbursed is usually within a month after we've spent money so that's a decision that's going to have to be made pretty soon if you want to start phase one and like i said if the city wants to do the whole project to complete it then the city's gonna have to take some of the reserve money out because there's only four million dollars from the county so that's what i want to bring you up today and we've got a report that we have to give to the county what i recommended to the county is i want to roll over 1.3 million to next year so in october you could start phase one council member shirley i took a question but how did we go from 2.2 when they're available to own them and the next year you're going to get another night so the five year program so they would reimburse us over those out years that we went ahead and deployed it out well that's a that's a question we probably would want in writing that they would say yes if we went ahead and paid for all who did it but if not i know what some of the other cities are doing they're doing it in phases and that's why i had it broke out in two phases it would be substantially cheaper to do it all at once but we would have to dip into the kitty yeah you'd have to have uh through next year you'd probably have to take 75 percent of your reserves to do it by snare gun well we've talked about ideas on reprogramming where hurricane disaster we're [Applause] the question i had was what's the decision where is the decision point if this is good till december 11th let's back it up where is the decision going through and we need to make a decision well i think i think as soon as you come up the sooner the better because as an example if uh if i i'm talking to mark porter in the morning actually to get some updated numbers if he gives me a number today his number may only be guaranteed for two or three months you know part of me says i would probably commit to phase one because we have the money already and work on the issue with mark because realistically the project wouldn't start to next fiscal year anyway because of the timeline that duke took i mean you're really familiar with the dave's familiar with it the timeline that duke took from the time we committed to them to the time that the supplies arrived to the time that we were able to get the conduit and everything because they were providing all that we just have to bury it is there a grace period for that december what grace period so for all intents purposes it's july now yeah you need to think about you know do you want to tell dude bring us a contract for the first phase which they would do and of course based on the last time around it took them a few weeks to get that back to us and then at the same time be working on the situation with utility consultants about uh drilling the their board now who's the corporate memory and expertise in the house that's going to kind of develop a project plan and out behind it for this this body to make an informed decision based on we need some assumptions and stuff like that but i mean where are they going to come from in the next four months yeah i'm getting that reserve salute here yeah the what's your salute well whoever your city manager is the person that's going to have to deal with this let's let's get realistic was that the sort of thing maybe let's do she want me to move back down here for a period and take care of it or you can just hang on and see there sorry approved already does mark porter had the expert change to take our project it is to come up with a project plan give us a information oh he no i'm comfortable very comfortable when we did the undergrounding you know now whoever the city manager is is going to have to be involved in this because there's numerous things that have to be done first of all we'll just take phase one there's some easements it's got to be obtained from some property owners because that means there's going to be some equipment because there isn't the right of way on both boulevard like there was with bellevue state's either and we did that on the west side already you know we went down talked to the property owners whoever it was whether there was a condo or a homeowner we even talked to the people in bellaire about and they gave us easements to put equipment on their property so it's the same process and duke will once we get a contract with them they will provide those easements now they used to have a person that helped us do that i don't know that they have that anymore because they've kind of changed how they do it but they'll give us these ones and i have talked to mark about it because the girl that helped leanne and haley that helped with the easements on the other side she doesn't work for duke anymore she works for mark so that's a benefit for mark to help out with that so in in a sense this is where we may have backed ourselves into a corner with electing to do it ourselves is that we may not necessarily have all the expertise unless you are unless you're here with us or at least guiding us in the right direction there's there's no it's it's the owner of this project well no the city manager is the owner that's the fact of life well as it stands right now that's that's the way it's supposed to be but whoever it is is going to be walking in mid-term of the project that we're trying to make happen well any city manager is going to walk into projects that's just that's a fact of life whether you want to or not if you're going to be the city manager you're you're going to end up especially in this community because we're so small you're going to end up in in those projects whether you started them or you got to finish it that's that's just the way it is so with four to five months to mobilize on this commit what's the level of confidence in two different scenarios one we just do a phase one that's kind of a no-brainer we can very with everyone pretty quickly if we try to do the entire thing the the money that's available from the county is only given to us in year increments it's not given to us as a big lump sum you know we we did try to go that route with the county went to duke energy and everybody and said hey i want to i want you to give me a price to do it all well unfortunately the county only came up with 35 million dollars and that's pretty much the same amount that was given in any three and we used a good amount of our penny three money getting rid of cross wires getting cable wires down things of that which unfortunately is still in progress at this other end with the cable company but i this is just you know me looking at crystal ball and i'm going to tell you there's no city that's going to complete everything underground with the money that was given money there it's not going to happen and i would expect the beach mayors would do what they did last night they went back to the county and said hey and that's how we ended up with another 35 and it was split up because i know for a fact indian rock speech is only going i want to say like maybe half the city you know coming north because that's all they may not be willing to give any extra considering that we're about to ask them for beach person well this comes out of the penny money beach renourishment money is a tdc thing that's right completely different yeah but at the end of the day the same people were voting on that yeah but but the other thing that i look at is the residence or the population in the community throughout the county is the one that votes for the pen and so when they update the penny which will be let's see if this is probably in 23 they'll they'll try to adopt what i call penny five this is maybe four they also should rather than making it the same every year they should be adjusting the inflation because they're collecting on inflation i understand that but that's you know that's how it's they they put it a penny is one thing two pennies might mean a novo you know kind of mentality so that's how i mean having lived here for 20 plus years that's i'm not proposing a penny raised what i'm saying is they're collecting more pennies because more dollars are based oh yeah yeah yeah i'm not debating that i'm not debating that but the beach renourishment money is in the tdc really unless the the county decides hey we got a little excess penny here so let's use it for something else but right now that's not the stipulation so uh you know i like i said moving forward after we get the numbers tomorrow or have that discussion with mark and get a little better feel for the phase one and i'm asking for you know to project out phase two i would suggest the console moves forward with phase one and start the process vice mayor i'm going to i'd like to ask kyle because he's going to be the resident expert in this and obviously be up his eyeballs in this project you got any thoughts on this or recommendations i mean i believe i could handle it um filled in with with what information he's given me and i i believe that definitely starting with phase one would be the one to go with but also give it i mean we could analyze if you know you're going to try to pay it all up front and then see where you end up is how much reserves you have left and you can probably grab you know draft it out so you can look at the numbers consider it in the time period but then on top of everything else we're trying to accomplish where does phase one begin and where does it end it ends of causeway starts at 28th street basically the entrance to the city and the west side is done so it's the east side that we're doing that we're doing the west side the electric is all done the only thing that's left on the west side is spectrum unfortunately we're at the uh [Music] we need a way to adequately address this to the citizens so they understand right now i'm having problems that'd be just trying to put it all together and i know i'm sitting here a citizen is not uh we need something put up on our website going here's the current status if this contract gets placed if it does go into place it would do the following and here's the map from x to y on the side of the street they get physical they need they need visuals yeah it but this money could only be spent foreign this is the perfect place where we ask kyle to undertake this and give us a briefing and a recommendation and scope about this project and say okay this is what's doable this is a this isn't doable this is the level of confidence we can do this phase and this is how we fund it this is how far we begin you know project deadline for [Music] it's also known as from the last meeting that the next budget meeting you will be the interim city manager so you will be sitting at this table right okay not quite yet so i just want to give you those updates on the underground uh like i said i would suggest going forward with phase one and get as far down like the other cities are going get as far down and go apart as you can mean these prices just just came out this is the last she yeah she emailed this june 11. the problem would i move forward on this copper is so expensive right now and it's it's not going to maintain its value it's going to drop i think i think this there will be a savings if you wait just get phase one done i mean copper's trading so high right now and it's all the materials are this isn't what's causing the fact here oh yeah that that is she didn't tell me that so considering shirley did you have something to add yeah i'm just i'm curious on that and i know i asked this question a lot so excuse me but i can't remember the dead service where is the building the building has got three and a half years and a half years why in 2020 with the budget year 2020 we had the actual 669 and now we only have budgeted 283 is well the now the depth the building technically the building debt service is 160 000. okay um no it's 160 per year that's the bag okay so right now it's about three and a half years we got to pay it off okay i thought we were less than that oh that's because i paid 300 and some thousand dollars down on bei yeah oh it wasn't it wasn't the building okay the underground project for bellevue estates we had projected 2.2 million when all was said and done we got how we did it we ended up getting a better price for duke we got some credits and we did the service we did the boring ourselves so once a year you can make a payment to the bank prior to may 1st on that bond and you can reduce it but last year i made a i want to say 300 and some thousand dollar payment and then i gave back i forget how many thousand to the people that pre-paid so the project ended up like 1.8 million so we gave all that money back and paid the debt down so what happened we were paying a hundred and i think it was uh i don't want to say the exact number but the debt service now is down to something like 112 000 a year on the bei okay okay and that's that interest so that's that interest together with what we paid for because you only paid the principal on the bei bond in may you pay the interest in november and may so what do you think that the ballots do on the mortgages for the city building [Music] yeah it was there was the penalty at the time [Music] uh bonfire yeah right out there well that's gonna put 160 actually right or like 200 right back into the candy raise man yeah but still burning mortgage right out there yeah okay uh let's go to uh age 37 47. this is a little you know more of the synopsis the things where we save for how we save things up so we have when we have time to replace it as an example of the two tumen roof uh we're at 33 000 that road estimate is 58 000. to replace the air conditioner here it's estimated 150 000. real quick uh just admin same problem occurred here um as before he had shed 93 000 vice to 58k okay yeah i'll go back and fix that hvac um briefly i understand you're changing over our 22 r410 um for anybody that's the refrigerant charge inside you're saying to improve efficiency are we claiming uh operating savings right now or we're just leaving the operation of the hvac kind of the same cost same cost okay i mean if the savings happened great if not in the budget have we gotten a final word on the generator kyle we received any more for january nothing more no we're still still on the list uh they're they're there again if we're fortunate to get that we're only going to be spending 60 000. the mayor did during the elections about providing a safe easy place for people right all right and what about the playground yet uh he's he's got the cost and we're going to do it to july yeah he's going to bring that to you to either say replace it or don't do anything [Music] we'll play it sir no there's no placeholder okay we're it's it's about twenty five thousand roughly give or take a few pennies all right well miracle is lower okay yeah but i'll i'll get them together yeah because we got two or three polls but these are off of state contracts so we can just constantly approve that you see like i said the morgan where we're saving something that we've added is paving the walkways added that to start a savings account to those uh this year bridge repairs we did not put any money in this year's budget to add to the emergency fund so you feel comfortable that the money that we've got set aside if it's a repair we should be able to take care of that and we haven't done that for the last couple of years so we're still doing the savings for the replacement of harrison and 22nd street the 30 000 that's in the bridge is the lights that are going across the causeway something would happen that's just a placeholder contingency yeah there was only one okay and then real quick you know mike keeps bringing up that point that those numbers need to match i don't think they do actually i think it's great information that you have here let's take the roof for example you have five thousand dollars a year for five years it's a five year plan however on that second sheet you're telling me that obviously thirty five thousand dollars there's an additional seven years of five thousand dollars per year needed to get the money that you need to replace the booth which is ninety three thousand dollars right why would you want to change that yeah mike i don't understand why you're saying that that's that's confusing to you exactly well we talked about that was the tools there's a couple that i will say there's a couple he's found i've marked them i'm gonna go back those were all the same things like kyle brought up they were years beyond 2027. which is good information so i don't want anything to change there because that's not only there's additional years in the first couple of instances that he brought it up there there was a mathematical error there were mistakes [Music] because the roll-ups don't take into consideration the beyond time frames it was beyond the time frame that's why i was there so that tells me there's a larger number page i think the mistakes were where the we had a breakdown of each category bring sub-category on this one so it was about the carpet for example right was it part of it or was it the painting the painting the paint so it's it's saying beyond 2027 we've got nine thousand dollars that's three more years of three thousand dollars required in order to get the total amount of money needed forty two thousand dollars to pay the whole building that's what it tells me and i think that's good information to have there if you're eliminating that column that's something i i just need to look at think about because accounting wise you should you know you have an expenditure right okay just because somebody like the county gave us 50 000 that comes back into the general fund but we had to spend 100 to get so it's it's just the way government county is this is something i i can't make it up okay i was on pay on the street on the street live we're actually kyle's in the process of uh looking at the street lights and we may start replacing some at various places where the poles are not good shape and he's gotten some numbers from um in the neighborhoods yeah he's got some numbers from dude and we've got did we get the final numbers from yes so we're so we need to talk i will tell you the solar lights for the most part have been really good the company's been good about the replacement parts you know the way the warranty works they give us some replacement parts we've had i think one is it one good luck arm that we had to replace it was the original model it was the first one we had so yeah so and other than that it's been batteries and programming i mean i know we've got that very first light at the bridge there uh it was a little hectic that's the oldest one that was the first one it was it was on the other side of the bridge yeah on the both sides yeah it was put up there as an experiment to see how they worked and how we programmed it i almost got run over a few times when i first got that people coming out of bdi what do you do at stanford street well i gotta get some connection to this streetlight but for the most part i think the solar lights have done well you know over the long term has saved the city money did we ever follow up on the grand money that steve barr sent us to information on a bit of great money given to some municipalities who are going to the silver running conference what now steve martin sent this information on some great money that had been given to me municipalities for the solar wedding projects yeah we we did look into that but that grant was on yeah it was gone but i mean we called i remember calling someone and asking if they would do it again at this point they're on our own uh what do you want to call it email us to tell us he didn't go to the new business model too when we do bids or select contracts we need to task the people we're contracting with to feed us information and even prepare a lot of the documents to chase green money a lot of people are doing that you know they built it right into the contract where if we go for solar lights we go to the solar light company and say what grants are out there assist us in finding great great business and more than likely those people are very happy to assist you with them because it's more sales for them so it's something we need it's one of the best practices we need to start building into our content i do have a question about street flooding program so we do have we still have some areas here that are dark and i don't right now i don't really see what what is this budget money set aside it's it's for that and replacements and as an example i forget what street that was on 17 there was an area the residents came to us and said hey this is a dark area and we went in and put a street light there so i know the bridge on here is that it's really dark the bridge on here is really so that's something that you know we did the street light survey to look at the polls that were here to see if we need to replace them and what the concept was was to take the wood poles out and replace it with concrete if you didn't do solar well we've got some streets like knife there's nothing they have one life at the very end they're they're dark and i understand that the lines run behind the homes you just pull it from because i did try to underground that one on i want to say it was 16th or something and the homeowner wouldn't give me uh easement dude this seems like a prime candidate for solar because why do all the underground they wind drill why hang wires overhead they don't have wires now why clutter it up but it's something we should definitely look into and if we have control over i understand that we're collecting 50 000 a year for for street lighting we should have some say so on how that body spin and that's that's a good starting spot right there we should never have a single street in this town that's dark and that one right there if you're walking around it's very dark and most i'm trying to remember on nights usually there's a street light in the middle halfway down the street i think it's all the way down the corner unless it's gone or you know unless it's burned out or something i don't i think until you get right behind this building here there's there's nothing [Music] you know that may you know buy an individual solar isn't price is not what i want to call it price beneficial it's not effective so if you're gonna buy solar and that's what we're looking at what does that cost to put the solar in same situation he had some spares i thought no no we didn't purchase um [Music] yeah it's not a big deal to replace the battery the the cost is renting the lift it doesn't cost us for the battery has never disappointed batteries uh 10-year warranty there was a study done and whenever they compared to the cost of using duke they pretty much just paid for themselves and then beyond that then they were free of the maintenance so after that 10 years they're ours and then you just have routine maintenance on so we need to be responsible for the battery which in 10 years we'd have to buy our own batteries but i mean they're ours right now right the city ensures that if a hurricane came through and knocked them over we got insurance don't you you know we're still going 100 it's more than that i think 145. i mean i've got a lot of documentation on it but what i can tell you those are the best lights we have in the city yep yeah they're working the only problem you have is if you get a light that in the bridgeman is a good example the one to the west side of the bridge the palm tree all right she hides it sometimes and as long as we keep it trimmed it's fine and the other thing you can do with them you can go up to the light and control its intensity when it is and whatever and when we got the first test line of course i was kind of new at it i ran it up to a hundred percent yeah right you know the whole neighborhood we had great hands but the next morning at five o'clock there was no light left in it because i hadn't ran it at youtube you know i was still trying to figure it out you can program a setback in it at times yeah and there are also you can also network security cables yeah i know a lot of construction sites we've used them at night now for the last three or four years yeah they're they were very it was a good purchase i need [Music] strategic plan right that's where we started focusing online right now it's just like okay it's in the budget [Music] number one priority or number five priority or something you said that i thought that should be an institutional appointment something you asked many of you but i didn't say it came in time but you know it's just we need to just make it listen to those things can you buy more library cards or do we buy more solutions what are the priorities here well the solar light costs about what you put in for the library we've got to see a couple seawall projects that are going on right now so a lot of that money is going to be gone for next year the 25 000 that's in there this year is for 7th street after the project the seawall project and boat ramp is done then that dock project will get started is that expected to start this year yeah yeah kyle's having a meeting with uh then you know i don't think we need to go over every one of the fact sheets behind it it's pretty much there the next section is page 68 which is the marina there will be a dollar increase in march and it's programmed in here a dollar for 40 increase at large that was set up on a five-year program we did one two years ago we got this one we got one more they put that is putting back about 62 000 back into the general fund every year it's profit from debris and the page right behind it one of those non-residents actually owned property here is that in that right cub one of the non-roads i gotta look at the list but there's non-resident property owners yeah yeah we they're classified if they're not a they don't live here they're considered a non-resident so they're paying a higher fee i don't know what you're saying i can't hear you if they're if they're uh they they may own property here so but they don't live here residents might own property they don't live here so they pay the non-resident rate bringing their boat and keeping it here right so i mean i think you know the big deal was to me was making it available for residents it's uh probably the only problem that i had with that was having one owner with two slips yeah that was it was that skill going on uh she's still there oh they the agreements yeah but they're both under her name but her husband is one of them is her husband's boat yeah and that's because they own two properties is that right yeah two rental properties so there you go well actually no no no they're still on the main they used to own three but they stole one of them are they full the marina no do they have both in both oh that's different okay and then on page 70 uh we put money aside because at some point in time we're going to have to pay redo the catwalks at the marina and we've got a proposal that we had somebody look at the filings and there's some politics that's got to be replaced most of the type holes not so much the something that's got to be replaced and others that we need to wrap so uh that's that's a project that we're getting more quotes for but if they're typical today that person's slip so would that person be responsible for disciples the disciples yes but not the typos the person didn't put the title over there so the lifts that are there are not connected to poles that's part of our devices but if they haven't lifted why do they need a title are these displayed yeah there's some typos that need to be replaced or re-wrapped we have a pull in between each dividing two slips and then we have them extending out from that line so just there's poles that are city-owned that divide between the two catwalks the two slips and then they have their lift poles inside of that yeah i think we should look at that i think that's something we should look at because i don't know why i mean if they're if they're maintained well it's the not everyone has a lift and so and the cap walks there's a couple of them for the slips so if somebody was uh they had their lift and then they vacated they removed their lift then you'd kind of just open space without a divider for that next and so if you remove the boat lift and the supporting poles then you still have divider poles that will serve as wet slip in that one slip did i say that that's correct yep okay and then the next page is the stormwater fund which is on page 75. and we're projecting to collect about 175 000 last year it wasn't really the first it was the first full year of it so we were a little shy of that so we need to see where we end up this year on the revenue we charge 15 of the salaries and wages into here for [Music] the public works people that do things in the storm water fund and then if you go down to the storm water system project for next year it is 498 680 and we did increase some of the estimates because we were concerned that with the escalation of that project it just happened that those are people up but until you bid them you know the price could change i was going to ask what what is the driver that would cause his body to re-evaluate historical workforce but what what's what would drive us to say hey we need to re-evaluate this footballer is it going to be on a frequent basis every five years or something or do we take a look at the economy and say hey you know we got some infrastructure projects due costs of materials are going up it's time to sit down and reevaluate our stormwater are we there well i think you're only two two years into the stormwater fee i don't i don't know that i would be looking to increase it that quickly now a couple more years yes you may want to increase it and you'd be doing basically the same thing you did last time study you'd have to hire a consultant to come in and do the storm water feeding and then the consul would have to approve it or not if you remember when they did the original one if we had charged everyone the actual stormwater fee would have been 71 a month and we opted to try to offset some of that expansion that was the key was it was an offset right so unfortunately we don't have a hard part to engage that against it was this was it a specific percentage or was it just a number we pulled out of the air uh well we didn't do we didn't know you we hired a consultant to do that i know that we we did everything right right and we were approved to do this but it was there is there a moving target that we can when lynn and i talked about it we were trying to at least have enough income to maintain that's that's really what it's for for maintenance and repair but it's offsetting some of that cost well i think what the vice mayor gun is is asking is there is there some sort of metric that would follow it will follow that says okay it's time for an increase or decrease or did we paint ourselves into a quarter to where it cost a lot of money to change that rate ever no no you've done the they're going to do another uh you know stormwater person it's it's kind of like any time you have a rate increase you're going to have to do have a consultant do an assessment on it and they're going to come back and give you the numbers like we did last time recommendations yeah but it would be interesting to have a regular maintenance budget and then budget because what i've seen is it all together here so you i mean you can kind of pull it out and get a good general feel of what that maintenance budget looks like yeah as long as your claws remain within some boundary you're okay but you set a trip wire so that hey if it's out of control we need to use we need to do something at least we knew it right that's probably we probably just need to have a work session reevaluating that store okay that's all i have if you've got any questions any other questions i've got a list of things some things you need to you know you need to really think about what do you some of the highlights i think the library reimbursement we talked about but i think i didn't get any real consensus that he wanted to do anything more than what we would do and i'll get you those uh code enforcement any any thoughts out of the first what you want to do you want to keep the sheriff reduce the hours do something else yes well i think lynn already hit on it earlier that you know it may actually make sense to have some type of a hybrid like you had mentioned before that you thought 20 hours was too much so as an example if we reduce it to 10 and then let laura do some of it as well if at the end of the day that's going to save us money and we're still getting the same level of service but i think that's a good well as far as reducing it by that much that may be a little drastic the reason why i say that is because if you're investigating a site where something's going on and if there was somebody across the water that was remodeling their home i guarantee you that officer had spent five hours trying to explain what it was they were doing wrong and here's here's the process here's what's going to happen to you bad things are going to happen for a little while and maybe you can you don't have a good defense and you can work this out we don't really know what's going to come up and is that what we want do we want do we want a hybrid situation where the code enforcement officer goes out and finds something writes it up and then somebody from from the office goes and does the pr piece of it where you're trying to smooth things over and make them understand this is why there was a a violation and here's what you have to do to fix it and that's the that's the biggest problem you know that's the time consuming part of it you can cite somebody all day long but most of them don't even understand what they're doing unless they're you know locking their door and totally remodeling well and there are people that do that they they i i we got several of them that they don't know is there a certain amount of hours a shared department will say hey look it's not worth our time well i th the way the contract is whatever number of hours it is you can give the sheriff 10 hours you know accept it yeah it's not your reversal right it's not irreversible right let's say we cut back five hours from now you decide how to manage your program desk cut back five hours [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one was that uh government purchase cards yeah and second one was car allowances cost benefit analysis about why we paid for all these allowances when we could just lease one car and you know sign it out here's the keys go gas it up [Music] we should all do that and um i mean i haven't gotten to the fine details and i had a whole bunch of items that i put tabs on just so that we could go through well that's what you know when i met with each of you that's what i was hoping you would do is send me those things so we can either answer questions or you know this is the first this is uh we we've received the first draft and i didn't make a lot of notes but we uh just do the time and this was a major overview of hearing what your reasoning was for everything our next meeting i think our suggestions should be reflected yeah that's excellent that's what the first meeting is for for you to give us feedback on what we did and what you think could change uh and that that will be july 18th that's that's the meeting okay so that there's a long there's a big big long time uh between now and the 18 that's that's a month all right and uh vice mayor gunn brought up that we've not even looked at all of this and throwing it up against the strategic plan so i i think we should get together and hash this out a little bit and make sure that our priorities are in line with the direction we where we're attempting to go and it needs to happen before this geological meeting or at least from the last well this week we have another meeting we have another meeting this week financially if we don't well let me just go through this right quick so we have um thursday we have the personnel special city council media for city manager candidates that's it and uh so we're going to have to go through the five candidates that the citizens advisory committee selected as the top five if we did it if nobody submitted an extra candidate right so all of us have the option to add an additional candidate we see somebody that we like that should be in that group so potentially there's uh there's there's a possibility of having 12 candidates that we would have to prioritize right so we as a group we're going to have to work this out to where we think this is our top candidate this is number two this is number three and so on uh once we we hit that point then we will hand those candidates off to paddy who will begin contacting them from the top on down until we have four candidates in the event if we don't have four candidates then i'm proposing that we have three but no less than three we need to have some people that we can have a sick meeting with and do a preliminary interview once we we have that interview then we'll decide the top two and we'll call them in for an in-person interview and then that night we will we will elect the new city manager so there's always a possibility that we may not be able to get through that list if it's 12 candidates i'm just saying i i don't expect that to happen because it seems like the scores are doing this and then they go residential but i don't you know it's i'm still digesting all the various candidates so in the event that we can't get through all of them on thursday the next available meeting i believe is tuesday so we would have to come back and wrap that up and then to hand those those candidates off to paddy to start doing her work so that means that next week or this this week we're definitely out because we're we're probably going to be over meeting and then next week if we don't have to review candidates if we're able to complete this on thursday maybe we can begin that conversation unfortunately it's because it's a work session we need to get some time so monday um i think i'm gonna have to look at the calendar and i'll propose a date i'll send it out to daddy and we'll see if everybody's on the same page and we can meet all right yes sir mr ross you mentioned five will be our objective on thursday well what it is is uh we our goal is to to take the five plus anything that we are we're all allowed to have one candidate if we want to my guess is if we add one or two it's going to be the same ones based upon what i'm seeing so i'm thinking we're going to have seven or eight candidates the goal is is to narrow that down and throw out and leave for four people that we can interview bison and so i thought we were gonna identify today we're going to have we're going to give patty the entire list so we have to rank everything everything all the candidates so the citizens advisory committee has given us their top five already right they automatically move over into our group if we add more right um we can do that also but either way we may not necessarily agree with the citizen advisory committee's top five [Music] we're going to give her all of the candidates that we have brought in to the group so we've got automatically we have five and then any more that we have we're handing them all to paddy and then she's she's gonna stop if she when she gets before that say okay we're in yes and you mentioned that if we don't get four three would be the lowest okay three would be the what's the plan b let's say we just start with five let's say nobody has any additions and we start with five and paddy starts with the list starts with number one goes on down she finishes all five and we have two what is the next plan well uh what the list has been the entire time is it's all been contingent and it's it's a living document so that's why you'll see updates like the okay we'll accept three i added that today because i got thinking it may not it's been a while now it's been having other jobs we may not have we may not have enough candidates it may turn out that we automatically have two well we've just saved a bunch of time and we can move straight forward for the interviews for the two yeah okay i gotta get the sense that you said if we didn't have three then that wasn't good if we're done no no no what i'm just saying is i'm i'm hoping we can get four but three is acceptable if we if we just run out of candidates right i'm trying to to at least give us the opportunity to interview them before we bring them in especially if they're let's just say they're in another state or miami or something like that give them give us the opportunity to interview them online before we bring them here because i don't want to waste their time now we're supposed to have also a date specific the 22nd to give patty our list is that a week yes that's where you act it's not a list you if you see one additional candidate that's not already in the top five then and uh and mr gunn sent that that list out thank goodness because i was struggling with that i was trying to figure out because i just had the right list yeah there's a natural breakout yeah yes it's a little late but on the agenda it would act it was actually going to have that list but uh so that's kind of the plan right now i want to squeeze this in way before we get to july the 18th is my point we need to have this just to make sure that we are in the right direction because just like those street lights and that's part that should be right there at the top it's safety security all right uh that being said uh do i have a motion to adjourn motion all right playing good falls in favor"
