    "transcript": "um charlotte demolay here here uh tony is not here right okay dave gaddis here kathleen clay here leslie noterow here robert rissberg michael sable here lynn reeves here okay um first thing i ended his approval of the july 16th meeting minute motion second second any additions deletions corrections okay all in favor opposed okay hey ps thank you um all right we've got a couple of things to talk about um committee deliverables and priorities as it says we talk about what needs to be communicated and i think um who put together the um the excel spreadsheet with all the priorities types of information and so on robbed it rob are you here rob yes i see you okay yeah that's the one i sent out and uh i thought charlotte was gonna do something with it so she may have added something to it nope you did what was needed to be done so save me some work i think this is um you know very it sort of covers everything that we need to do you know and prioritizes it immediate routines periodic any comments on this on this strategy you know before um comments i would just say that we didn't really talk in detail about um the how to communicate so when i created that column i just filled it in as kind of placeholders i didn't by no means am i trying to impose my thoughts on everybody so i figured that we would massage that when we got together okay um good point um i have a couple of comments on the how to communicate when you have like auto call system are we talking about robocops robocalls well what i was thinking there is we had discussed i think in our first meeting the uh a system where you can do i guess it would be similar to an auto robocall but it would be with a specific message from the city when i i think david talk had researched several of the things that could do text as well that's that's what i took your robocall our auto call to be auto call slash text so yeah maybe we ought to put that in to clarify call slash text hey um so so basically i tested one service uh yesterday and uh i used the city staff as my guinea pig the the name of the service is click send and it's about 1.2 cents per person per message and you can break it up into you can break it up into text messages or voice calls just depending upon how the person wants to receive their message you can also send emails directly from the same system but i think it's kind of ridiculous to do that if we're if the cost of emails using a constant contact is less than using this service then certainly use constant contact but if it's the other way around then maybe this this service might be the way to go so i sent it out i i had a couple of problems with it because they saw me sending out a message that that was it was a simulation of a water main break on 22nd street uh so that so they flagged me as a spammer because they they didn't think that i was really with the city so uh after after we got that cleared up then they they allowed the messages to go through uh so uh uh lynn or patty um uh i don't think kyle's here but uh would either one of you like to share uh what what it looked like on your end as as somebody who would just receive a message yeah it just was uh what we received was a text message it basically said from the city of bellar beach there's a water main uh break and it will be resolved no later than these phones we have uh no later than friday evening so it was a text message and it came right through right after david said he was going to be sending it to us so dave does yes go ahead question um when uh the people to receive that do they have to do that opt-in and agree to any sm sms fee or does that the service cover that fee um you know if anybody's paying for text messages these days they need to look at a new plan uh but but uh no uh if anyone's receiving those messages it's at their own uh at their own cost if any are incurred however the plan is not to blast everybody in the city with those messages what we're trying to do is we're trying to give the customer which is all of us the opportunity to say this is how i'd like to be contacted so let's see we've got email we have text we have a voice phone call which the service actually did a pretty good job of that also uh and then you've got your standard social media you've got snail mail you've got you know all of these different ways so so basically what the way that i envision it is you've got a list of important messages the ones that really you want to know what's happening such as a water main break uh how would you like to receive that message would you like a phone call a text or an email that's that's pretty straightforward and i think whenever you're signing up for that list uh you say that hey if you're receiving any charges by getting this message you're on your own the city that that would be ridiculous to refund somebody there uh that money and that would be some one of the options that we could put on the postcard that we send out to all of the residents saying you know for safety issues and you know emergency kinds of things like that how do you want to get those i i would think so but i also wonder if people are going to be a little leery about putting their personal contact information on a postcard that's not in an envelope you can always always drop it off at city hall that's that's a thought or possibly what if the the postcard directed them to a form on our website uh where we actually compiled the data instead of having to manually transfer it from paper over to a database i'm thinking that a form would just give it give it all to us at one place and then the it guys could just spit it out for patty one time um well you say you know put it put a form on our website in our the city of bel air beach website yes okay and how do we control that it's only the people of the city of belarus beach that fill out that form on the website well uh because against uh i don't believe we're allowed to prevent any i think anybody that wants to get on that list can okay and what sort and what sort of um personnel time is involved in like if they when you did this quicksand thing today to paddy and lynn was it an extensive um you know is it going to take a lot of personnel time to get something out um i i actually have it pulled up uh if i'm able to present i will demonstrate right quick okay now i do have a question before i get started would anyone else like to be a volunteer i can add it i've got a basically a a contact list that i set up for this group but i've not added anyone to it except for myself yeah obviously like a beta tester this is just just for this meeting and this group and whenever we're finished with it i just delete the list yeah i thought it wouldn't mind yeah i'm fine yeah i'm in i'm in all right so uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to add now normally if if once our database is compiled say that we've we've we've pulled all this data out of the website and we have our our beginning list of people that we want to start sending messages to whenever the the need arises well patty's not going to be manually entering these things just every so often she'll get an update on the database and then that will be imported it's pretty straightforward uh so i'm gonna add these right quick and uh all right so here's a phone number uh leslie what's your phone number 727-215-2199 jumper dave yes dave can i mention something um to anyone giving out to anyone giving out their phone numbers don't forget that this is uh recorded and it'll be put on the website oh you're actually you're doing that okay um i'll tell you what we have to yeah i know leslie's is already a public record from her campaign but i didn't know about anybody else's hmm i i don't i don't i don't have a good answer um i don't mind giving up the robocallers all have it anyway can we email it to you patty and then you can send it to dave do that real quick why don't we yeah everyone do that right quick i think our applications are on the web already and it's got this information i thought i saw it in one of the agenda packets our applications for this committee yeah so i know yours is to charlotte probably yours rob i don't know what numbers you put on kathleen mike yeah everybody whatever you put on your applications is already a public record so leslie i i i i stopped typing uh while we were discussing that would you give me your number one more time 727-215-2199 got it all right is everyone else emailing them are you just going to hand them over i can handle who's going first [Music] okay i want the table here okay i didn't catch that oh sorry 301 all right nine four three three four four three all right and there's that one and okay who's next rob yep you ready yep seven zero six five eight zero two five six seven i'm an x 706 or myself next 813. who is this charlotte oh for some reason i thought i already put yours in it's okay all right say it again eight one three four two one four four seven seven all right and the first one that i got who was that leslie no there okay yeah okay all right uh who's next anyone else did anyone email i did did you get it patty well on one second okay and if you hear snoring it's not me it's my dog i'm gonna remember that one i have your elect dave gattis email does that one still work all right i'll just send it i'll send it there that's okay i just forward it kathleen thank okay yeah there it is got it uh i think let's see what did i get okay let's look again here i didn't send anything exciting there we go all right yep i see it okay one two three four five and i would be number six okay uh uh patty and lynn you don't you've already seen this are you good yep okay all right all right so uh let's see here i need to become a presenter patty a presenter so well it doesn't have that option okay hang on hang on one sec all right it may be it may be oh there we go share screen all right we're good to disabled go screen sharing can you in you know re-enable that hold on one second because that's [Music] make sure i okay so and dave advanced sharing often options who can share all panelists right now it's only host just switch over to all panelists okay all right done yep and i'm good to go okay now then find my ride screen here there we go okay so back to here okay so this is the screen you can see that i've added you guys all right so uh if if you'll look right up here can you see my mouse yes oh which is balance okay you'll see the balance is 2.74 cents so uh so so basically what i'm going to do is i'm going to do a quick sms that is so cool okay so i'm going to select from the list so start with a c and there's the communication committee and it's right now it's from a shared number that means you never know where it's going to come from but i'm guessing it's going to be a 201 area code we will have a dedicated number if we decide to use this service uh so whatever that number is we'll actually publish it that expect a call and whitelist this number uh if you're if you uh want to get past so from the city and that's okay and uh i don't have a template i'm just this is just i just logged in i selected that list and now i'm going to send it all right and send you can see the cost is 13 roughly 13 cents is was well 14 cents roughly to uh sim send this to this group so here we go and i'm sending it off now you can always check the progress uh i already got my message yeah i got mine yeah i got it already yeah okay so you can see how quick it is especially in the case of an emergency i can't think of a faster way to do it now let's do one more uh let's see here i'm going to go into voice quick voice and we're going to do the communication committee again and i spell that wrong i sure did yeah there we go all right oh run run oh and by the way have a nice evening okay so uh you can see what i've done and how quick it was i'm going to select send now all right and this this group is going to cost 8 cents i'm going to send it and let's see here that that should be it should this be coming through text messages on our cell phones this is going to be a phone call oh okay now you see right here it says wait approval it's because i'm the new kid on the block on this service and they're trying to make sure that i'm not doing any funny stuff so they may or may not let this one go through but i actually admire them for doing this because everybody hates robocalls um but what i always recommend is you're limited to characters on sms you have more characters on mms and voice you have more characters but always announce this is the city of bel air beach that stops people from hanging up if you start giving a message before you announce who you are they're they're not going to listen so you can see that what's happening right now as a human being is going to look that over and decide whether they're going to let it go through i just got it once okay i just got mine yeah and mine is ringing too so can you hear it of mine yep mine just came through yeah um yeah got it understood yeah yeah how easy that is yeah and that was very smooth i've spent i i just sent a total of 12 messages and you can see i did it for uh 20 cents roughly what happens on the text message if i decide to reply to it um it won't do anything because it's a shared number with a dedicated number you may be able to uh to bring it back i did see that there was something about uh receiving messages let me see what this is messenger they're gonna totally screw you up if i said if i send a reply to two or one it wouldn't know who to filter it to because it's a shared number so so basically it would go to the service and then just die knowing if it was received then by the people now there is a way to to know that it was received and if you go to history right here you can see received i just re i just responded to you this is my reply to the text message is that what you wrote yep well there you go and then you can see where some of them failed so [Music] if cell phone numbers change or anything like that you can certainly drill down there's sent there's failed there's received it's very it's a very thorough service and there's no there's no sign up fee uh other other than just throwing some money into the account and using it as needed we need we would need a dedicated phone number we can't use the four 595-4646 uh no you would have to uh use one of their numbers uh that you know that i'm sure what they would do is they would give you uh give you a list and you would pick one but it's it's a dedicated number let's uh let's take a look at that right quick and see so numbers uh let me see here sms click here to purchase your first dedicated sms number okay so here's a bunch of them and it looks like they're all eight three three numbers but you would have the same number all the time there's a there's a seven one nine you know i guess you could go through and and pick which one you you thought would work best for uh for you so let's try this numbers with let's try 727 not that way how about what's uh tampa's area code it used to be 813. nope so you just you know it's kind of luck of the draw you find one you like and then you see what the cost is a dollar and 63 cents per month what type of classifications do you have for the contacts so are you able to break it down you know because i'm assuming we're going to collect what street or addresses of everyone so if you needed to send the water main break on 22nd are you able to send it just to that street you can actually if you want to get you can be as granular as you want for instance if i go back to contacts all right so i'm on this list but i'm also on the example list so you can have as many lists as you want and and and like basically if i said uh uh bellevue estates island then i could create one like that or if 22nd street or north of the bridge south of the bridge any any which way that you want to so let's say that there is a water main break on my street well no one else would care except for my street and the streets that it feeds to so that might be a good way to break things out and it also depends on how much time the city staff wants to spend on making it granular i think for these we don't want people to respond though leslie because we don't i don't think we want to respond to all the questions or comments right so maybe at the end of something like a robot a robo statement like you made we would put you know that it's not manned or that no response required or no one something about no one will be able to respond right there was just a what if somebody want you know yeah no it's good to know but i don't think we want to do that well there's there's some there's some uh problems with that also sms is cheaper to send but you're limited to 160 characters i can fill up 160 characters in two sentences uh and so if you put do not reply or apply then you're taking up characters and you're not getting the best thing for buck uh if you went with mms you could go you could take it further i think it's up to 600 characters but then you're going to have people that will see it's bel air beach and they don't like lengthy messages and they're just going to ignore it so you know we're in a world of short attention spans and you just basically have to adjust to it and if you don't have a smartphone which yes there's still people i have several in my family that don't you you can't get them a mess it just comes all over garbled that that's that makes sense and i always recommend just doing sms uh and then voice so you you give them two options and uh now there's one thing you can do let's say that you do want to send a lengthy message in sms if you go over 160 characters it will break it up into two messages and you will get back-to-back messages from the same number but we're charged for two messages instead of one that's a very interesting system well i mean i i'm stolen dave i think we ought to recommend this to the city it seems like it gets it part of what we want to get it and it's not very expensive and pretty easy to use yeah i occur with that it's timely it does it's not going to require a full staff member to deal with this thing but question weekends evenings we just don't get messages or um you know i would think that um if there's anyone in this city that knows what's going on during the weekend and knows what an emergency is it's going to be lynn or kyle and that would be the only time that i would really recommend sending out any messages would be during an emergency or but but point is is this service is so easy literally it would take either one of them two minutes to blast out the city with something going on you said even they could do it absolutely charlotte couldn't resist i didn't expect that so uh lynn and patty uh now that you've seen the backside of this service uh what do you think well i don't think the the no it's not a bad service it's similar to even code red you you load the numbers and you got them in the process and then all you have to do is type the message yeah the the issue just to clarify you know we we don't get notified as an example because the water sewer and things like that are not ours they're pinellas counties and a lot of times we wouldn't even know it was broken until they came to fix it so and they don't notify us when something breaks uh so we may need to work something out with pinellas county and and i don't know how they notify people either unless it's a major break but those things are kind of a county issue not a city issue uh you know there i'm just picking out some things that are on the list that really we don't have any control over unless as an example the sheriff tells us which he doesn't tell us that there's an accident every time until after the fact so uh if we broached it that way there may be a problem being able to tell someone that hey there's a water break on 22nd street well that that's probably a bad example but i'm sure that there are plenty of other examples that we're really missing out on yeah yeah and i'm not saying that all i'm saying is uh i don't want you know the committee to think that if somebody breaks a water line on you know a contractor hits a water line on 25th street that will know anything about it because the contractor calls the county directly they don't call us i just looked up the alert pinellas thing on my phone and i think we need to encourage our all of the residents of bellar beach to sign up for that because you get mandatory evacuations hurricane information gas leaks boil water orders utility notices flooding events hazard events local emergencies you know that covers a lot of what we're trying to put up and the county's doing it and that's that's where we probably need to go through the list and say okay right off the bat these emergency items are are off the uh yeah they're not our responsibility but we need we need to encourage the city to sign up yeah right all of our residents to sign up for pinellas and it's totally free to us which and it's this system is very simple i i mean once you kind of maybe it could be broke up into segments of town or something like as an example uh they're going to have a run along gulf boulevard and it runs to 22nd street then we could we could send a message to the people on 22nd street north that said hey when you're coming out of your street there there's a run happening on saturday at 7 00. that would be a good a good use for the header right yeah i think this system is part i'm sorry go no go ahead i'll wait i was just going to say i think that a system like this is just part of your web of of systems i agree alert pinellas everybody should be signed up for that the city can do this if we go with a facebook page the city posts some notice there you know it's just another hopefully a redundant way of getting information to the people who aren't on all the other systems right i'll tell you something that i would like to see on it and i don't know you know this is one of those items that um that everyone uh they talk about but they never actually do anything about it they want to know what's on they always say i didn't know what was on the agenda um yeah i didn't know what was on the agenda otherwise i would have i would have been at the council meeting because i have a strong opinion about blah blah blah and i would like to uh to be there for it and uh and then after the fact they always say well had i known so i i think our list one of those things should be uh council functions you know what's going on uh maybe a brief uh summary of the uh the agenda items just so that everyone that wants to know can be on that list and uh and there's no there's no surprises about it i have an objection of the objection to that it's on the agendas and all that are on the website i don't think we need to spoon feed them everything else if anyone wants to know they should check the website it's on there well as i believe kathleen just said not everyone uh was it kathleen or charlotte someone said not everyone had smartphones and i'm guessing if they're busy they're probably not sitting in front of a computer i just think it's another option you know i'm not saying that's what we have to do but uh there's there's always an argument for someone who is not connected all the time like i definitely need agree you can't limit to just straight desktop computing um i mean sorry i mean i do a digital environment you really need the phone uh counterpart period because that way they they have their communications ability uh through sms yeah pumping out their sms i agree with that approach um but you just can't leave it on computers i mean this is what we've been doing so it's kind of an indicator of you know what's wrong so it's time to move it from straight desktop to uh phones as well but but isn't the didn't i hear you say and i don't know that much about all the sms stuff but dave didn't i hear you say you can only put 140 characters on there it's 160 characters with sms and with the mms it's i believe 1200 i believe that's what it is i let me let me find the email right quick i agree more but uh you remember you can pump a second one as well you go part one of three part two of three part three of three yes in fact i could uh i could literally spell out the the full agenda if you wanted a hundred text messages but um i think uh certainly you know what are we discussing tonight uh and and just as brief and concise as possible uh with you know is is an option and if it happens to spill over to a couple of messages instead of one well it's it's still going to be more reliable than mms again whenever we are doing our survey and we we find out what people want they and basically that would be an item that they could say yep i want these messages or no i don't and then if they do how do you want them and this is where they would go uh i i'm i'm not trying to make lynn and patty the the messengers of everything but at the same time they can uh i feel like the city for those people that are busy and they're running around there should be some way just to let them know what's going on remember the the the purpose of this group is to find out how to better communicate with the citizens yeah i also agree the other thing is uh frankly you should a lot of businesses if you're working at the business they really don't you know they kind of frown on that i mean i understand this is your city this is what's going on but it's viewed as extraneous uh where for your phone that's yours you can punch it up if you want and again it's a push mechanism it's not pool data it's push yeah go ahead i should say i think that's the key if if all we do is rely on the people to go get information on the website we haven't solved the problem that the committee wants help solving or the council whatsoever going on that's the old old school we gotta go now well i think they need to it needs to be pushed to them but i i guess where i'm trying to figure out if if you only have 160 characters for a text message or whatever that is and you look at it next week's agenda yeah you could probably put that in there but an agenda a month ago there's no way so horrible how do we do it on business is frankly you write the word document fairly simple you can count the digits on there you just highlight it it'll tell you how many digits they are uh you just break that word message up into one of five two of five three five four five you just copy paste it you just make five copy paste five text and now everybody gets pushed a complete agenda what you know uh screens one through six so they'll have it and i'll have it pushed to them therefore they're able to get it wherever they want they don't have to access their computer where they may not be allowed to and not only that but a lot of people again you know they're not at home um and even at businesses not a lot of people have computers i mean if they work for the service industry or if they're working around a hospital they don't have a dedicated machine they can use can you attach to a text message dave you cannot with sms but you can with mms now the attachment is uh only an image however with mms you and smartphones which i know not everybody has a smartphone but the majority of people do by now so with mms first off let me tell you the differences between the two sms is 160 characters the cost is actually 2.28 cents each and you're only limited to text for mms you're limited to 1600 characters plus an image if you want to attach one uh the cost for that message is 2.61 cents per message so bang for buck mms is the better way to go but there there's always a possibility somebody would not get that message however one thing you can do in mms is you can attach a link so if whenever the agenda is uh whenever a meeting is happening we could always say the morning of the meeting there's a meeting tonight at 6 00 pm click here for the agenda the other thing you can also attach a photograph of the agenda uh we've done that in the past where you get on one page or two page there's the two photos just you know click on it increase read it yeah i'm just looking at it from the standpoint uh if i got five text messages i i wouldn't even waste my time if it came from five you know five numbers in a row you know the average person is just gonna say delete delete delete so if you could attach either a picture or uh what you just said a link that that would seem to me would be more efficient for the person getting the messages well i have a question about attaching a link if the link says get you to the city web to the agenda on the city website but you said these people don't have a computer to go on the city website in the first place no hold on you can do that on the phone too if you do have the smartphones basically you just click on it's hyperlink you click on it you're there it's much easier than going and finding it if it's if there's a link already there your phone is going to take you right to it but what i'm going to do is i'm going to take uh i'm going to pull up the next council meeting agenda while we're talking and i'm going to i'm going to real quickly i'm going to create an mms message with that agenda hey dave i just drafted a an example and this is what my example would say bel air beach council meeting 3 august 20 and i abbreviated august a-u-g uh next line that's the military dates rob yeah but you can okay so say say august 3 20. uh 20 next line 2021 budget next line traffic next line beach access next line fall festival that's a total of including spaces that's 86 characters so you can hit the major agenda items in two text messages you don't have to put you know the whole agenda the consent agenda and we're reading an ordinance for the first time you know you just put the big things and that was in less than a text and a half okay and maybe a couple of extra ones if we use full civilian uh dates lin aren't you uh i saw something all right wouldn't you send out that new sms to us uh with the hyperlink in it and we can test it from there well okay so um you guys just keep talking and uh let's discuss the the list if that's okay uh with our chairman one of the issues i have about this communicating on facebook um and patty and i were talking about this the other day about issues like um you know public records and how how do we control that the city doesn't have a facebook page now does it uh we officially we we don't officially have one what would what we've done and i was going to update you on this i'll just tell you is all we we went to our website hoster they did a plug-in for us we have set up a facebook page behind the scene in a twitter account and we've tested it to see if whatever if we put it in a certain place on our web page if it goes to facebook and twitter and the the test we've done that has worked it it has to be some from our webpage the plugin looks like it has to be from an announcement as an example we have an announcement of uh there's a fall festival on such and such a day we put it in the web page and then it transfers to facebook and then it transfers to a twitter message and how do we maintain all that information for um public records reasons well it's on your web page it's on your web page it comes back onto the way it's a it's a link system so it's all connected to one another that's that's basically what it is and my understanding is as long as we don't get in a response on facebook and twitter if we're just pushing information out then we don't the the there that's a different animal we're not the public records law only is getting collecting our information that we're sending out and i don't think that's the committee's intent for us to respond if that is then there's going to have to be another person for that because we don't have that i don't recommend any response i i've said it from day one lock it down basically it's one-way communication that is not a medium that we want to number one we don't want to be handling messages direct messages in facebook number two we definitely don't want to have debate yeah don't get into a troll fight right right so i don't think that's a public records issue because we are maintaining it through the website already and what's the point of putting it out to facebook well that's just another social media i guess just like twitter is just like uh what else is there out there instagram you know it's just another medium for someone to be able to get information you know if we advertise that yes we have a twitter account if we advertise we have a facebook account and we put those announcements then your multiple on the website and they automatically go to those okay and you asked you asked your friend wayne to write a little article about how the city is trying to push more information out he puts it in the article yep and then once you uh the people that use facebook and twitter they they check it often basically uh you encourage people to follow you uh whether it's facebook or twitter and uh your posts go right to the top of their page whenever they log in because it's fresh content are we still here are we sending something out dave uh not yet i was just you know i'm looking at our agenda here and oh man i'll tell you what what do you think when 10 p.m this time i hope not this is city council yeah that's not this group no this one ain't happening that long thank you i'm shooting for a lot shorter there then just an fyi your facebook page doesn't have comments locked down yet oh well i'll just yeah maybe make a note so people can make comments i don't know if any because it's not live i wonder yeah it is i found it for the city of bellar beach city of bel air beach official oh and it's got your um post for the uh what was it a special city council meeting set to native military virtual meeting is that what you posted yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it well we'll have to make sure because we don't i i don't think responding is is reasonable yeah well are those uh are there public comments are they posting no i just found it and i i was able to click the comment and i mean i could write something in there i won't but i just want to give you an fyi yeah yeah uh so let's let's get that logged down uh if he can't lock it down then what needs to happen is temporarily you you suspend the page until you're ready to go back live with it and there's a way to do that yeah i think this was this was just for a test anyway right yeah it we haven't you know it was just to see if it worked from the website how do you get on it from the website through the residence thing or then no we we haven't put it up on the website at all it's it's just was a test to be able to say to make sure that if you put a message on the website that it transferred automatically so you wouldn't be logging in three different systems okay oops type the wrong thing guess what um going back to this um spreadsheet about the recommended communication strategy do we have any other you know i think we got the the routines and the periodics i think that makes you know makes sense things that we need to communicate any thing we think to need we need to add to this everything else looked pretty complete to me yeah and and this is sort of like the strategic plan uh it's probably a little more of a living document as uh as we uh start using this we may uh find things or we need to add you know yeah since uh since we've been talking here this evening i've i've made two uh changes one i added um i think uh i've maybe it was charlotte or somebody else maybe dave uh under the auto call i've added that slash text system whatever we end up going with and then uh at city meetings there i just penciled in where it says email email and text as dave used the example of pushing out an announcement of a council meeting or committee meeting or something okay i think that rob i think i would also add that under the status of infrastructure because i think some of those just looking at that list maybe some of those things that get targeted to specific areas and it would be good to use that system walls and bridge status if it's your bridge or street or roadway traffic updates if there's a run on boulevard yeah yeah good that's probably an auto well an email or an auto call text depending on how the resident said they wanted to be contacted okay i think great job on that um list i appreciate that um the postcard that was sent that was um that we got i like it you know contact me by email text message um i use the website if you want to put contact me by snail mail if someone wants really wants mail mail on the website is it the newsletter on the website or is it separate the the newsletter we send it's on the website but we send it by constant contact except for things that have to do with the flood facts and things like that we send out by mail how often does the beller beach newsletter come out is there every every other month okay it hasn't been updated on the website the last one is from june 2019. let me look because i don't remember the newsletter yeah it gets sent to the constant contact list and uh if you're not the last one the last one that you sent out right well that was the one that had the news about the bel air shores ordinance that started that whole thing right right because then you sent a little while after actually correct correction yeah yeah but we've been sending that out every other month uh but the problem that we found is it's a the the list that we use is is a very small percentage of bel air beach residents it's probably less than half on the constant contact list yes you know that's why i i've said in our previous meetings and i i strongly think that we should recommend to the city council that it consider a uh a hard mail a snail mail newsletter obviously i don't think you can do that every other month but maybe it's a quarterly type of thing because of that exact issue that lynn just mentioned the only people who are getting the electronic version of the people who who have asked to receive it and so your best bet on getting information pushed to people is something that comes to every resident the city and there's a pretty good chance they're going to look at it before they throw it away i know that'll cost money and the city council will have to debate that and see if they can afford to do it but i think it's an idea that we ought to give the city council for consideration agreed charlotte i agree yeah um another if we send this a postcard like this out we need to put a i call it a disclaimer saying any address you put on here any phone number you are put on here is a matter of public record i thought david suggested not having people return this postcard using a computer form i would suggest we still leave contact by email or phone just for the technology you know those that are technology technically challenged and then maybe when they call in or email or on you know have that warning on here but i thought he had suggested taking it off so that people aren't sending the postcard back the mail with their information right on it right basically uh what i would recommend is uh is as we discussed earlier is uh having a form on the website collecting data with a phone number that uh you can call if you are unable to to use a form you know if you can't go to the website for whatever reason you're not able to use a computer uh i i know it's it's kind of a hassle uh to to do things manually but uh it's just as much of a hassle to try to filter through postcards and uh and convert the data and again i don't i don't i think many people are going to be apprehensive about mailing the thing in the very sense something out there saying you know we're looking at ways to better communicate with the citizens um here are the options you know snail mail email text messages the website or whatever please there is a form on the website for you to enter enter your preferences or if you like call city hall and someone will take your information rather than sending the card back we did that bel air beach um it was when they sent that thing out on on the um parks and on the back they put please take one minute to let your thoughts be known and we we would change that but it was to our mayor and city council by emailing p gentry at city of baylor beach dot com we could put something like that on the back of it oh which card is this it was we did it for bel air beach brief i don't know where mine we didn't do that that was a resident city didn't do that okay that was a nice one that they had on the back they just had that little thing about right no it wasn't done by the city it was fancy lin i thought go live yeah no it wasn't me or patty okay i know who it was then but it was a good idea at the bottom we did something similar a while ago for the um the undergrounding project at the um bellevue estates island estates yeah we used um yeah through the university of south florida institute of government helped worked with us on that one that was i don't know how many years ago but um yeah don't have them send the card back say we're just looking for this information go on the website and check it out or call city hall yeah yep or come into city hall and we'll have a forum at the front desk again i think it boils down to do you really want messages from us or not do you do you know is it worth a little bit of hassle for you to uh to make this work um we'd probably send it to to a an email like info we'd probably put that as the contact or put a form on the website if somebody didn't want to give it you know if they want to call it's a one-time hassle you know you know in the big scheme of things yeah it may take some time and energy but if if you're able to compile something then it's more beneficial i agree and we did pull down something else we did pull down the as the residence all addresses for the city from the property appraiser and and we looked into the voter roll but that's not really any benefit because it's a list of people that voted yes but the addresses are still the same it's not changing anything so we do have the list of addresses yeah it's about i don't know 25 pages or something something like that but we didn't list it we didn't list it by name we listed it by uh just address or a condo with a like unit 401 2400 gulf boulevard you know that that's how it's listed for each parcel so we would send them out to residents at 2400 unit 401 yeah as an example uh you know all the condos in you know the condo we'll say 2900 we've got all the unit numbers so the postcard would basically postcard or whatever we sent would be addressed to to this unit list that we got so we've done that are you planning on when this gets sent out if it gets sent out you have to take the recommendations sending it to the tactual addresses that are not belair beach addresses as well well what what originally was asked was the addresses that were here uh we would have to create a different list which we can do but because yeah there's that's true there's a lot of people that have a different address for their taxes yeah guys on the unit above me live in buffalo new york you know so then does it go to them or does it go to unit b2 and then hopefully their mail gets forwarded to them right they would forward their mail i would think well you've also got like the home we just bought had tenants in it you know the owners didn't live here um we live here now but i mean you see you you may not be always getting the owner if you send it to just resident you may be getting their tenants right and and that's going to have to be determined who do you want to send it to do you want to send it to the property owner do you want to send it to the tenant to the to the people that live here let's put it that way who may be the voters they may live here full time and be registered to vote here even though they don't own the property right right and i think that's who you're probably responding to who are the voters well the voter list is shorter than the mailing list i can tell you that is it how many how many voters do we have any sec patty might know that maddie it's i think it's around i i haven't looked at it in a couple years since the last election but like 1100 just that's just an approximate that is a lot less i can find it real quick no just just curious okay but you're gonna get a more complete address list if you use the property appraisers list right now another thing that uh that i i considered was uh i looked at the email list that um that lynn provided me with and uh basically everything was already compiled there were no phone numbers it was strictly strictly emails and um nothing else uh some of the emails didn't even have names you could sort of make out what they were but it wasn't uh it wasn't perfect and uh but there were quite a few of them out there and it seems to me that you could send that list out by constant contact and and get a jump start on collecting data by just directing them to the website with a newly created form that would immediately eliminate probably hundreds of dollars worth of mailings that we would need to send out to collect this data how many people do we have on our constant contact list you know 469 something like 469 but as i said we don't know that those are all residents and the other thing i do know in looking at the list that some households have two two and three emails because they've got their name on them or something yep i saw that but it would certainly give us a jump start on on collecting that data on our form on our online form and then uh you know while you're collecting this data you might as well you know what's your physical address um so you've got name uh your address and then uh here's the types of of data we're planning on sending to you how would you like it uh each of these to be received yeah what we'd probably want to do is send that out and tell them this list is going to be discontinued because it would be you'd want to create a new one and uh if you want to be on the main on the list then please forward us your name phone number whatever we want to put on that card and then what we could do because the list we got from the property appraisers broke down by street as long as we had the address then we could call those names off of it and you know at least we'd have some data good there yeah start get rid of the 469 counselor 400 whatever constant contact people then that's a start we could but we'll be really building even the constant contact list again you know in essence it'll be our quick our click send list yeah that that's that's what we're moving the constant contact list to right if we go with this well i don't i don't think you want to eliminate it if if you know you got two or three options of pushing information out so why would you want to uh it's no different than we put information on the website we put it on facebook we put it on twitter we put it on whatever other right to me that that makes sense that you're pushing information out if someone wants to opt out because we've sent it to them on uh click send i may be saying it wrong but if we sit they don't want the the clicks in they want the constant contact then they can tell us that and we just remove them from whatever list that's that's i think you're right you need redundancy that's the only way to try to get better coverage right okay another uh another key piece of all of this is maintaining an expensive database uh it's not hard to extract data from each one of these services and um you know it's just every once in a while you refresh your data make sure that it's it's curry and if anyone is opted out you you show that they've uh that they're no longer in our our master list that way if we ever decide to change services or use a new service or anything else we we've at least we still have the data excuse me chairman i have to leave right now i got a 4 30 a.m appointment so oh i'm sorry that's okay well thanks for all your input and um have a nice sleep are there any um other changes or that you want me to make to this chart this uh excel spreadsheet i can't really think of anything i think it's pretty um pretty thorough then i'll up i'll update what we've got here which is really pretty minor in terms of just adding the word text and and uh in a couple places and send it you know through patty back out to you all here in the next couple of days and um if you want me to be the the one who modifies it just send back through patty any recommended changes will make it work okay thank you um i i'm assuming and i haven't looked at the um monday night's city council agenda but i'm assuming there's a report from the committee oh patty did you put that on there i don't think so no no but but we can we can amanda but that yeah he'll be fine okay because i think if you know if we were to um it'll it's going to be a virtual meeting i will tell you that okay all right it's not going to be will it be over by wednesday i hope so not funny sorry we is there something you want us to do with this postcard you know do we want to actually i see tony there now do does he want to uh send this to us and we'll we'll do a couple modifications to it to to say send it back to city hall by phone or email and get it cleaned up do you want to do that or not yeah i can send it to you it's can you hear me yeah yeah i can send it i did it in publisher and i can forward that to you like i said it's a very rough draft it was just an idea you know of um what it might look like um but that's certainly not my forte is you know creating something like that but um but yeah i can forward that to you and um you know we can we can try to you know is there any comment because it sounded like the group was talking about having the the contact either be by phone or with a form or something we create on the website is that what i understood we need this information go on the city website you'll find a form that looks like this postcard and fill it in or drop it off at city hall or call rather than sending it back right i mean if we get this cleaned up we could we could actually put that out on constant contact once the committee's fine with it in consul you'll give the council of update on monday so i do have a quick suggestion over on the notification options on the side is to add phone call under that every if the city does approve going with something like the click send yeah yeah we got text message on there too okay and you may want to add twitter since you tested starting a twitter account because it listed the facebook page well we've we've got it set up in the dark so you might as well add it i mean yeah twitter starts to can that kind of get into the social media thing with the back and forth or can you do that to where you don't have that we don't respond we have to make sure we're not not interested in responding you know we'll take the informa you know as much as people do use twitter i don't and i don't appreciate twitter and i almost think it's worthless um for basically what we're trying to accomplish it's just always it's it's sort of like next door only on a grander scale and anything that we uh we do there i i don't know i just have a bad feeling about twitter i like the facebook idea but obviously it will be the council's pleasure to just to determine what they want to do what they want to do but i i would i absolutely would would veto or not veto but vote against it yeah i have similar reservations about twitter this we've put in there the alert pinellas on that city of bellar on the postcard do we want to confuse that alert pinellas emergency only number and ability with all the rest of that which is purely belair beach communication well i i you know this is the problem is that um is that they have to be on that media to get things like the water main break um it's it's really it's part even though we have nothing to do with it yeah i would say that we just recommend also signing up for that i think that needs to be clear that it's a recommendation and those are the things that you get with that with signing up for alert might not be a bad idea to clarify that our services will not will will not bring you this information and here's a list of what we what we cannot do for you because we're not in control of it and providing that form on the website will give us a lot more space than a postcard will so we can explain that in more detail encouraging everybody to get an alert yes and sorry i'm i'm checking in late oh no problem no problem okay anything else we think we need to talk about well since i missed the start of it could you start all over daddy could you send the recording no thank you okay well maybe we'll give you a quiz tony as long as it doesn't have a lobster in it because i've seen enough of that i don't want to see that again okay well i think we've gone over a lot of good stuff tonight um we'll go with the council meeting monday night um daddy that's a zoom that we can get in on and i don't know if we're if we're on the agenda or not we will be i assume yeah we can amend that and then yes and you can get in on the zoom yes and then you'll send a copy of the um updated spreadsheet to the council members so they've got that in front of them and yeah i will love i'll update the spreadsheet um probably tomorrow and get it to patty you know before noon so that she can send it out to all of you okay great thank you very much okay well i think we've done some get some good discussions tonight do we when do we want to meet again like the 13th would be gonna be like the 20th that would be three weeks our thursday is good for most people yeah yes i won't be able to do the 20th okay the week before on the 13th i can do that i can do that yeah works for me patty lynn yeah yes we're flexible okay so let's schedule our next meeting and it's six o'clock on thursday the 13th hey anything else we'll plan for that that meeting to be uh on this same format right zoom yeah they they uh extended the virtual meetings right now till one september okay good thanks all right anyone have anything else they want to discuss i don't think so i i would recommend that we wrap this up at our next meeting yeah i would give it back to the city council and say here's what we talked about here's what we suggest it's in your hands now right yes so it's pretty much the next meeting all we need to discuss is ways of monitoring effectiveness um and then kind of the discussion to substantiate our position and because it look i'm looking at you know the deliverables and priorities on the agenda and i think we've really covered a um b has kind of been and i guess we haven't openly discussed it but it's been kind of in the background of everything we discussed with cost and stuff and then d as well with use of uh social media we've had that in the discussion so i'm just kind of i want to clarify the things to think about for next time um is that pretty much just c and e that's left monitoring and substantiating our position right i think you're right yeah great good all right dave i just got a text from the city of bel air beach council can you hold it up oh can you all see it yeah i i don't think i'm authorized to use that logo please don't sue me lynn [Laughter] you just send a text message and uh i i i i'll send you uh i'll i'll forward you the one that came to me so you can see what i say now it looks good okay i just got it now i don't have it yet mine just came through it's interesting it came from it didn't come from the same number that's right it's because it's a different service same company but i guess they have dedicated numbers that they're using [Music] this is the quick center click send is that yes but this was the mms that's how i was able to get the uh um how i was able to get the logo on there we'll be sending you a letter dave i'm already putting in my anonymous request for all your phone messages i want to see the text as well okay okay girls uh motion to adjourn all right thanks much thank you sweetheart bye bye bye"
