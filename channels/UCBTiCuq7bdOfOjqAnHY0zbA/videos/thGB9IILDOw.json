an official answer from council member Roberts I couldn't tell I did not have an answer from council member Roberts all right we'll uh continue moving forward and uh if we can get him back online then we continue yeah I'm sorry can you guys hear me can you hear me yes okay are we good we are good all right our first order of business is approval of the agenda do I have a motion to approve motion motion is made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by council member Shaw ellot all in favor I any opposed all right the agenda is approved Now we move to citizen comments any citizen would like to address the council about a topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand and way to be called on we ask that you limit your time to No More Than 3 minutes and remember to direct all questions and comments to the council if any council members would like to respond you know the drill if the city manager or City attorney would like to address citizen comments please hold your responses until your designated report time would any citizen like to address the council about a topic not already on the agenda see as we have none so some comments are now closed all right now we are on to item three we have a presentation from the pellis county sheriff's office beginning with a monthly law enforcement report welcome sir please come up give us your name and title and uh and let's have the report good evening I'm corpal Mark Rees with the Sheriff's Office this is the May 2024 report oh um we only had one incident of let me interrupt you for one second council member Roberts could you mute until um until you'd like to speak okay I think we're good goe uh we only had one larsoning and uh one assault in the city during the month of May there were nine total people arrested in the city of Bellard Beach during the month of May there was a possession of a control substance charge along with a couple traffic misdemeanors and a warrant charge uh there were 673 events during the month of May with 768 responding units uh the top events in the city were house checks directed patrols vehicle and abandoned Park illegally uh traffic stops and city ordinance violations uh there were no crashes in the city during the month of May and we issued uh 100 104 parking 81 traffic tickets and 26 warnings during the month resulting in 213 citations uh the correlation uh as usual a lot of them occurred on Gulf Boulevard and that's all the data I have for make for you thank you corpal Council anyone like to ask question yes U yes cor um we're going through our budget right now we got of STS increase with the sheriff's budget um I'm trying to figure out because we get a sement back from B our Shores and it looks like we I guess they allocate about 1.2 hours a day um for Sheriff duties okay I can't see how that is not wor than like 2.5 hours or 3 hours a day would you have any would you have any idea of how much time that I can't speak to I will pass your concern on to Captain liner and I'll have him reach out to the city I really appreciate that thank no problem any other questions or comments for the P Elsa member Roberts you have any questions or comments okay I'm going to take that as no thank you cor I appreciate it thank you sir now we're on to the monthly code enforcement report you Trump here yes he is hello how you do good evening I'm Deputy Trump with count Sheriff's Office and I uh assist in helping with your code enforcement uh for the city this year I'm sorry this year this month for the month of June we had 42 entries uh with that um I had various different calls um we did seven unpermitted remodels uh seven other enforcements which um include anywhere from garbage not in cans things like that uh all the way to direct the patrol so it's kind of a an open uh type of category um I conducted four Beach patrols uh five construction nuisances uh we are dealing obviously with the hot weather the rain rain and everything else we're dealing with a lot more plant overgrowth complaints High Grass complaints things like that so we're trying to address those and talk to them residents about some of their plants kind of over growing fences things like that uh and then we had U uh a couple of calls referenced just clutter in the yard things being stored in driveways that aren't supposed to be there uh and then one uh boat Trail complaint that we took care of so it was a a pretty easy HT uh we were pretty busy also any questions thank you Deputy any questions or comments for Deputy Trump and for me thank you thank you one second uh Mr Roberts do you have any questions or comments I do not all right thank you so much Dy thank appreciate you being here yes sir next up we have a presentation from the pel sunos fire and rescue District I do not see there we go how you doing sir I'm good how you do good uh my name is Chief stoneberg I uh I'm here today Chief Davidson had an emergency u a special meeting with Indian an Indian Shor for the district um and he obviously apologize he couldn't make it but he sent me instead so hopefully that's a good substitute but um for the month of June uh there were 18 calls in Bell b beach during the month that include like a fuel spill gas leavs water rescue a diving incident motor vehicle accid and heat exposures and some other medical calls um and the uh just an update the district has purchased property to a better serve Bell Beach uh the new fire station is going to be anticipated to be built within the next 20 months uh the location is at Northern end of Indian Rocks um which allows for 2minute response time inell Beach uh we are currently working with the county to provide Staffing um so we can put a unit in the area prior to the station being built to get that moving one F get a better response um our goal is to provide the highest level of care to our citizens obviously and uh with that there's any questions be more than happy to answer what I can any questions for the chief Mr Roberts you have any questions no all right if you don't mind would you please mute good thank you very much thank you I appreciate you thank you and and tell Chief David and he's in trouble again all stay there all right next we have an update item number five an update on the causeway and go Boulevard intersection for pelis County Public Works hello sir please come up and uh announce yourself and your title uh good evening my name is Tom wasman I'm the division director for transportation for Public Works penel County um I've got our County tra engineer here tonight as well Jeff Thompson and our timeing technician Nick papadopolis we' got a presentation W taking part in it um I want to give you guys just a little bit of brief history on what we've done out of the intersection I'm I'm going to hold you for one second can you speak a little closer to the microphone I'm sorry is that better the volume turn down I'm sorry better much wonder I could hear anyone I'm sorry about that let me start over my name is Tom was brown with County Public Works on the transportation division director got our County Traffic engineer with me here today Jeff Thompson and I've got our timing technician uh Nick papad we got a presentation on what we've been doing at the intersection here recently but I want to give a little bit of History before we come up and show you the modeling that we've done um going back to 2014 uh we had a pedestrian study that we did along the entire stretch of P Boulevard including City Clear Water IND Rocks Beach and b beach the results of that study is what resulted in the U pedestrian crossings that we have out there including the one that's just north of the intersection um so that dates back about 10 years um 2016 2017 with hurricane Irma the intersection is damaged pretty heavily it used to be a span wire so we s upgraded that to M arm has given us the ability to apply more technology at the intersection which we'll show you here as well um in 20120 we were contacted by the city to consider um a study at the intersection looking at complaints that you guys are receiving are relating to us about delays at the intersection primarily southbound and westbound traffic so we hired a consultant did a study which resulted in the configuration of the intersection uh that you see today primarily the change was changing that southbound left turn from the single Lane to the two lanes and uh making some other adjustments and that's how it's been operating since about 2021 um in 20203 February 2023 we were contacted by council member Roberts asked to take another look at the intersection um so we've been doing that since then um in April of this year we had council member Roberts and City um manager out to our facility showed them the modeling that we're going to show you today showed them um the detection devices that we've got at the intersection and what type of data that's providing to us and then uh came up with some recommendations that we've been going back and forth into the city with so um uh so that's kind of where we are today and with that I'm going to ask Nick to come up and kind of go through the detection that we have at the intersection the data that is pull and then modeling that we've on um to get to where we are today all right right thank you hello everyone my name is uh Nick papis I'm a traffic signal timing technician I've been working in the C for 9 years now So eventually I moved up to being the timing Tech for the county um and what we do daily as a team is we monitor intersections we keep an eye on traffic we try to make intersection more efficient we try to identify problems other pedestrian problems or vehicles or illegal Crossings whatever is related to an intersection that can make it a work safer so um my presentation is a little bit different today I'm not to show you a powerpoint we just going to see some live data and uh also software regarding um some new AI technology we installed at the intersection right down the road here at um boulard so give me a second let me share the screen all right so uh when the request came to uh our group monitor the intersection it was a good chance to um Implement uh one of these new devices which not only um does vehicle detection and it also does analysis so it counts pedestrians it counts Vehicles it tells you things that you cannot see um every day or constantly monitoring section so um the system is called called C Vision uh hopefully you can see it on the on my screen here and uh we do get a live view of what's going on in the intersection right now it shows us the vehicles what's uh what's out there and if we click on the camera we get a live feed and it shows us exactly how many vehicles are there um a class suppes them by categories as a light truck a heavy truck a passenger vehicle motorcycle bicycles everything they're pretty powerful devices now and um having the ability to gather all this information uh makes it easier for us to analyze all the data and figure out what's going on so right now you can see a live feet of the intersection um the southbound approach the Westbound and then on the bottom is the the Northbound and uh every time a vehicle Rolls by we do get like a count and a unique Sor a unique number and um that goes into the software and then we can run an analysis and a report to see uh how many vehicles so let's see for inance for today um we're going to do a 1H hour increment and see what how many vehicles are um moving through this intersection every day and you can see graphs here it tells you how many vehicles are southbound how many use the BL Lane how many use the left lane and um for this intersection we are mostly concerned about the right now for the southbound left turn and the southbound so um looking at the data any any day you look at all the data there's more than double Vehicles trying to make a soft left ter and vehicles trying to make a food movement so right now today we have, 1500 Vehicles so far um going through South down but then you had 3,300 Vehicles going a sof leer which is more than double and uh the reason we need all this information is we want to analyze what will happen if we go to reduce the capacity from a two leg South Lester to a one leg how bad the traic will back up and uh to do that we we take the report from this software and then we enter all this uh the numbers into another software which does modeling so this is the most popular and the most powerful software that um all the engineering firms use is called Synchro studio so um right now I'm going to show you the scenario of what is existing at the intersection so right now we have a double left turn lane for southbound and we've been we spent hours monitoring the intersection we do have CCTV cameras uh let me show you real quick like we can monitor from our office constantly this is a live feed actually from another camera uh and we can monitor what's going on um am Peak traffic off peak moments PM Peak traffic weekends you know we could uh turn it around and get an idea what's going on so we could compare the data that we get from the software and we can actually get a a real U time image of what's going on so you know we like to be sure what we uh propose so once we take all that data now we have all the counts we can put it in the software and usually we take the worst case scenario for um every approach so you're going to see some numbers here for softbound 203 vehicles for through 619 for left turn you know westbound westbound is also a pretty heavy movement it's almost as busy as the southbound and most of the time a little more heavy but um anyway once we put all the data into the software now we go through the simulation and um it shows you what's going on I I will speed it up a little bit so um you can see the the traffic moving it looks a little bit cartoon view but that's how it works um so right now uh we don't have any significant backups we haven't seen anything um dramatically there's a couple of times that um we experienced the backups do to a special occasion maybe there's an accident or couple of months ago there was um a sand sculpture um event going on at C Beach so we experienced a lot more traffic so but on an average date um we don't see right now with dual left turn Lanes a lot of backing up Vehicles into the block into southb Movement Like passing the the median for the adment cross and um this left the left turn pocket right now all the way back to the medium where which separates the The Pedestrian Crossing can roughly fit around 12 Vehicles so 12 vehicles per Lane you can get around 24 without blocking the southbound traffic they can still keep coming um South if they want do uh now so far even in this Synchro video you don't see any backup everybody's U happy you know there's a little bit of U the problem I think is when they merge over here to the left cuz they don't have a lot of room um and they have to start merging so as soon as they make a left turn there's a marking on the ground that tells them you have to merge and it seems like the the problem is uh heading east as soon as they make that left ter people try to cut in front of everybody and there's a little bit of confusion uh I have spent U several hours at this intersection observing traffic actually uh in the cabinet real time and uh there are a little bit of a confusion with drivers some are more aggressive some blow the horn but uh other than that you know the backup for the south bound is U not there and uh feel free to ask any questions in the meantime if you have something okay I don't mind being I think the and I live I live south of this intersection so but the people north of this intersection I believe the biggest complaint is what you just said last going eastbound now he said you can I think he said you can hold 12 vehicles going coming from the south and the two lanes correct so yeah this pocket here we call you the pocket but the left turn Lanes from the top are all the way back to where the medium starts where the the Palm fees are for The Crossing for the you can roughly get because you have 12 Street also there blocking the traffic uh there is a marking there that said do not block so some Vehicles block some those so how many how many vehicles can you hold going east before you have to reduce it to one L you know what I'm [Music] saying right are you holding 12 total vehicles are you holding 12 vehicles for Lane coming from the north think be a different situation because those cars are moving where the ones that are held in the southbound LAN are stacked up and they're still and that's what I'm saying so when the late turns they're all getting aggressive to go East so you have what 24 cars and 12 cars that's the worst case in add we haven't experienced 24 cars in once usually an average is uh 10 to 12 come down this weekend can experience yeah and and and from J from January 1st till at least Easter every probably I mean I I I I pity the residents that live north of the causeway I mean I'm starting to see it on my side but I I hate to say this but I think they've adapted to knowing that they can't get out at certain hours of the day and they just one guy shaking his head I think he he had a scenario 3 hours ago one time um uh the danger I think that everyone is worried about is going east and these guys are gunning the cars trying get into that one L correct I understand that's why we ran a couple of scenarios here we didn't know we do want so um let me stop this one and then we could U run the second one which is a SLE I I can assure you I already know what's going to happen and there's going to be more than uh 12 cars at any given time and you're going to block you're going to block all the traffic so uh yes with one uh with the existing configuration of the intersection um unfortunately it will block the southbound uh through Lane completely because it will back up into the through Lane past the island and that will cause D to be a little more upset do you mind if I ask Mr Roberts if he has a question for you since he's got an ongoing dialogue Mr Roberts do you have any questions or comments I I can't see you so uh okay let me it down thank you well I guess my first fav would be I think everybody would be in agreement um with the following statement that if you have a single Lane of traffic coming from the north to the South that wants to turn left on the causeway that would be more safe than having two lanes turn turn into the so so that's get it that's the way it used to be and I agree with everybody that when it was in that format that there were times I don't know how many times but there were times when the traic come in from Clear Water wasle and your cars wanted to turn left on the causeway they would block the cars wanted to goes down so that's how it was before and the decision was made to change that to two left hand turn Lanes to alleviate that problem and by doing that it's an unknown but man if it ever happens when two cars are turning left and the inside car bumps the outside car and that car jumps the Curve and the worst case scenario there's somebody there we don't even want to think about what happens so that's what we're talking about this I understand the queuing of the vehicles in the two lanes and that has helped the southbound traffic to continue going south through that intersection but if it's at the risk of safety of going through the intersection and turning to the left I'll never be in favor of that so as most you know I I have brought to the attention to the county we' had conversations about it I'd like to know if we were to remove that island and create just a single left hand turn lane the cars would Quee and what's now known as that five directional L I clearly that would be more safe to the cars turning to the left and it would also return the blinking left and turn light which allows people to turn left if in fact there's no traffic coming from the south to the north and and they're either there turning to the right or going straight so I think that removes some of those cars from the que to begin with so that that's my biggest concern it's just the two cars turning left I truly don't believe it's a same situation and I'm concerned if two cars St there I'm not worry about the cars cu the speed is fairly but if one car gets pushed the outside Lane gets pushed towards the curve and somebody's there that's going to be a problem would you like to address Mr Robert's questions and comments yes sure um thanks for the feedback and for we did run a scenario for um the island removed also it was the next uh slide so give me a second let me R the for the remove this one does look better but removed is the the thirdy run which is um going to allow the sou to move without blocking them and um so this is the third we worked on uh having the the island removed we we can't tell for sure how far back we have to stretch it uh we went all the way back to 15 Street for this simulation but um that was a little bit excessive uh we could probably uh make a little shorter but just to see how it it works it looks like it's uh it's not blocking traffic um and again the flashing yellow AO is not always the best solution because um it's kind of like a double-edged sword what happens is can you pause it right there sure just the way it is thank you all right continue please um the flashing has one uh disadvantage if there's a lot of pedestrians and uh usually weekends or early in the morning there's a lot of pedestrian activity when they push the bu across the road the flashing yellow gets disabled it's a safety feature that the FD requires it's called P for so every time there's a crossing and they push the button they don't get that flashing out they have to wait it goes into what we call it restricted left ter so most of the time you should be okay are you talking about The Pedestrian crosswalk at the island or you talking about no not the island the intersection yeah okay yeah yes like the intersection so every time I can zoom in a little bit so let's say right here there's a pedestrian going north and south this flashing will be disabled they will get the the red arrow they're not going to be able to move so most of the time to King but um typically when there's a lot of activity uh usually it's early in the morning when everybody's trying to go to work and that's when it gets disabled so if you get like a couple of cycles of pedestrian activity what will happen is this will start to back up also cuz they're not going to get that Gap in the north from the Northbound traffic to clear so uh typically you can clear another four or five vehicles it depends on how heavy the Northbound is or how much of big of a gap you got but that's one disadvantage of the flashing of a otherwise if there's no traffic northbound you could clear as many cars as uh you can within that time frame because uh every movement has a specific amount of time and seconds that they can utilize now again that can be adjusted if the third option is to be chosen and also another disadvantage of the single Lane um southbound left with long queue is now you need more time for vehicles to accelerate so even though you're not blocking South traffic you need a little more time to clear more Vehicles because they're going to be 300 ft back at the intersection by the time they make it to the Stop Bar it's almost time to max out and move to the next movement so let me ask you a question if you will uh if you'll move uh move down a little bit so we see higher so you see more Norther so if you look at 12th and 13th how do they get out during a high volume of traffic in this scenario with no Island how are they going to get in the Middle Lane how are they going to make a land not sorry right now there's a do not block at the at the intersection both of these do you think for a minute that they'll follow that I understand but uh we're keeping the same setup so so it's up to the drivers to obey the rules just like speed limits the signs are there but nobody obeys them but um we're just trying to simulate in the software I understand and we did notice there's like a parking lot over here like a public uh parking over here right next to the this Zone here I don't know how these people get in during traffic or out um they they wouldn't be able to either there's no way they'd be able to turn into that public parking what everyone would have to do is head north find an empty spot to turn around which would create more problems um I I I would like to make some suggestions if you if you've got time sure um can we pull up the uh presentation appoint I mean I just want to point out some obvious things and then show you what I think May alleviate some of the problems without without doing away with it the second turn L because um what I can say is since you've done the two lanes even though uh we all have identified a possibility for danger I can assure you I have not seen backups like we've seen in the past I've seen where we've had to wait and wait and wait for sometimes as much as 10 minutes to get out on go Boulevard where it was backed up so bad especially towards the end of the day uh during say spring break or special event you you couldn't get out you couldn't make a left turn because traffic was was uh was backed up so bad uh so uh if you look at look can you see on my screen up there okay so this is what we have today and we already know that that there are definitely some issues okay would you go to the next slide please okay so if you look at at um car number one in the right lane um it's it's about to turn right it's coming off Causeway Boulevard would you hover the arrow over the car number one because it's kind of hard to see all right see right there yes all right currently the stop line is so close to that intersection that you have your I call them ring stalkers and they don't actually stop they slow down and then they look to the left and they try to make that turn Mr Roberts would you mind muting for just a few seconds while I sorry no no worries okay so you're rolling through that that intersection you're looking to the left and then you're going to make the right I've seen car after car after car roll over that point where number two is there we go well wrong going what happened he's going to put it through Zoom he didn't have it oh okay all right one one second okay should I stop sharing or there we go okay Mr Roberts can you see this nod your head yes can there we go okay so the car with the number one on it is doing a rolling stop and you can see the car is already already has the wrong angle for that turn I see it over and over and over where car is making a right because they're looking left they don't have enough time to make a a a good decision as they're approaching in to make the right turn so what happens is they drift over into the oncoming traffic and then they have to they have to make a quick course correction um now if you'll go to the next slide please so here's where where we are today if you look on the asphalt you can literally see where cars have have left a rubber on the road showing the directions that they're making uh how they're turning if you look at car number three and position number four this happens over and over and over they're coming through that intersection and they cross and you even showed it in your example your computer picked it up that they cross over that yellow line as they're approaching the intersection and they're doing that so that they don't have to slow down and they feel like that they're able to stay on that inside Lane now if you look at uh number five with a car on it um that one is swinging way out because he's afraid that car number three is going to bash him so he's swinging way out but he's also following the dotted line lines on the street that's kind of the angle that we were blessed with whenever this was redone if you look at where he's at right now he's headed straight for that curve these are these are these are it was so easy for me to find this all I did was went to Google Maps and and and grabbed this picture but it was a great example showing exactly what's going on in our intersection if you look also uh at the the street you can see see there's also places where there's rubber where the car on the bottom turns in so everybody's doing this same thing so obviously we've got we've got some issues and here's what I think may help would you please go to the next slide oh and by the way another another problem before I go to the some what I my proposals is that cars are they they have to sometimes f for themselves because it looks like they're going to have a they're going to collide because this car is angled wrong that car is angled wrong and they're and they're wondering who's going to who's going to do the wrong thing so not only do you have to worry about getting in the appropriate Lane but you have to worry about your neighbor bashing your car next slide please uh go ahead there let's see okay so here's my proposal that is to move the stop lines back there's one on gold Boulevard you move that one farther north and you move the one on Causeway further uh further east and while you're at it go ahead and move the U the cross the crosswalks I realized that it would cost some money but I think that it would solve a lot of the problems that we're having right now the reason why is because if you look at the dotted white line that's been painted it's supposed to guide those cars headed south and then turning on the causeway the the radius is too too steep it's too hard of a turn to safely for both cars to do that together so if you go to the next slide you see this is where the the radius is is bigger it's less of a dramatic turn by simply by moving those lines farther away from the intersection um now this may create some other problems such as I believe you would lose two cars in your left turn Lanes so instead of 24 cars being able to handle 24 you'd only be able to handle 22 but I believe what I'm hearing is that it's rare we have a full stack uh whenever the light turns red and we're busy it's rare that we have 22 full cars filling up both both turn LS is that right it happens but not very often not very often okay we just a few times okay but if you look at at the turning radius it's painted there now compared to my U caveman drawing that I did uh my my radius is is far larger than the one that's it's painted on the street I think that what that would do is that would help make the left turn much safer than what it is today because you're not having to make such a dramatic left um next slide please uh also by moving it back your little uh the the guy who likes to do the rolling stop he's not going to be as close to that intersection whenever he has to start thinking am I going to get in trouble for running this traffic light so he's going to have more time to keep looking left before he eases up to the intersection and makes that right turn his his Rolling Stock uh also I believe that you're going to have less opportunity for crossing that yellow line as you're making the right um so that that's just some observations I've made uh next slide please also um because the crosswalks are now farther out of sight from your right Turners the the the no right turn signs that I see in lgo would be that this would be a perfect home for them if we were to Able if we were able to move these uh lines back so you have one on the uh the Northbound side preventing them from turning right whenever there's a pedestrian and we have one uh on the westbound side preventing them from turning right whenever there's a pedestrian Crossing there next slide please you already did this thank you very much I appreciate that uh but also can you explain to me what the um what the reasoning is for four lights is it a law is it a require what what is the deal with the two round lights um in the right way yes that's easy that's a a federal requirement you need to have two uh two life per approach so it's like a safety issue so if one let's say red ball goes out you still have another one to back up okay so per per approach you need minimum two lights that's everywhere okay so I'm going to tell you what I've observed is that it's confusing to someone headed southbound and I've seen countless cars and you you can probably go and look in your database and you'll see it also that you've have you have people running the traffic light in the middle turn land headed south because they think that it's okay to proceed forward and so I I don't know what the solution is if it's a a federal law maybe we could slide those two closer together or something like that so that there's less confusion U because the arrows are pretty straightforward but unfortunately it looks like one of those green lights I think people are confusing and they don't know if it's if they're allowed to go straight or if they're supposed to turn left or what they're supposed to do and that was that was one that the city manager and I spoke to each other about we knew that there there would probably be an issue with that but it just seems like maybe the spacing of the Gap maybe if we can get them a little closer um they have to be by law they have to be minimum 8 ft apart 8 ft apart so we can double check to see if there is maybe a little legal room okay but because of I think there's a also street name sign on the on the arm itself we might not have too much of a room to play okay I can pull it up real quick see um if there's any wiggle room but usually they have to uh they have to be within the the lane and certain degrees Yeah I can uh I think that that one has uh what we call illuminated street name sign so late at night it illuminates the the street name of the road so I can't tell if uh yeah they're pretty close to each other so I can't tell if it can go maybe a few inches or maybe a foot but I can't see it being too much uh also I forgot to show you all that that you mentioned this off Capt you go into the notifications here's here's an example me okay can you see it down we maximize so the software captures all that that mentioned everybody's clipping that uh westbound left turn lane when they're making and it's on and on every day that's all we see in notification most of the it's called wrongway driving it also captures a bit of red light Crossing so people that are uh here we go doing red light uh there's a lot of U instances we have a lot of pedestrians that U um don't push the buttons across the road captures them as a pedestrian violation right here so sometimes you know you'll see oh this is a motorcycle but yeah most of the wrong way detection that um um you mentioned is uh is captured in this software you'll see all day um anytime you look it's always U these West time and we did come up with a proposal for that Mr Jeff Thompson U prepared a little proposal to what we think could uh help the traffic and um let me pull it up on my computer so one thing we noticed is U the lines on the road are faded and um people are accused the the skip lines what we call so the skip lines have faded out and they can't keep the vehicles while while they're making left turn in track so this is U similar scenario to what uh we just spoke about a few minutes ago uh maybe we could refresh these uh paintings uh move the stof bar a little bit back uh there is a merge marking on the ground here very close to the intersection right now which uh we think um forces the the drivers to start merging a lot quicker than they should uh and we were thinking maybe delete this and um keep the other one Downstream which is the like um 100 ft not even uh east of there and um stop probably mention that one um adding markings now you did mention in the previous uh slideshow a no turn right there that could help but it could also cause backup because now you're your holding that U westbound leest turn uh movement for the whole amount of time that they're allocated actually that would be to the right so the right turn I mean they would have to stop someone's cross in the street why would we not do that correct but right now um most of the intersections vehicles have to heal the pedestrians so once The Pedestrian clears they could proceed so let's say you have another 10 15 seconds remaining in that movement keep it clear maybe another five six vehicles but when you restrict the left turn when The Pedestrian is there now you don't clear Anybody Everybody the right turn correct they have to wait for the whole split so they're going to lose the whole cycle they have to wait for the next so um it it could um Help The Pedestrian safety but it's not going to help traffic especially on days when the westbound right turn traffic is very heavy and this also pestan activity uh it will CA some backups so it's something to consider also going back to my original question going east I can see four marks okay and coming from the south I can see like seven marks so so that 24 car scenario turning it into that eastbound Lane it doesn't fit is what I'm saying and corre they will have to marage right what I'm saying is if you do the mayor scenario by moving the marks back I don't I don't know if that I'll try anything but does that now accelerate those people even more you know what I'm saying you're giving them more more of area to accelerate no my my thoughts were not that my thoughts were more of were they were going to be able to focus their attention more on merging and less on maneuvering that term because because this all comes down to human nature I'm sitting in traffic I'm upset I want to go home if I see an opening I'm going to gun the car I got this big machine under me and they're trying to get over the bridge I mean that's just human nature and um I represent the people of b beach I really don't care if the people get backed up all the way to s k because we we have these ways apps we have this Google Map and they see a large traffic G maybe they won't come here well excuse me for that if you um are saying you're representing all of b beach you just completely forgot about everybody on the north side of hos no no I I mentioned that earlier I said our our residents have more or less adapted that they cannot get out certain times of the day that CLE so what do you do if you need something are you just stay home no what I'm saying is if we're making it easier for people to get here it's just going to cause more traffic I I think the the purpose was to give them more an easier way out not in going that way across go or across Causeway is to allow people out because if you look you've got two lanes turning South I understand you've got two lanes turning East what I'm saying is the two lanes turning East is compressed we can only fit so much into that East thought I'm jeffw the traffic engineer I wanted to speak to your question about going eastbound um when you're going from two lanes to one lane there's a formula and it's based on the the width of the travel Lane and the speed limit not so much the capacity um so where the two lanes go to one lane you have over 300 ft between when there's two full Lanes to where there's one lane and um you have that much what's required by the formula is about 250 ft so you have roughly 8 more ft than what's required to narrow I mean go from two lanes to one lane so um where the merge like Nick was saying where the merge here the first one as you come around from South to East um that's a little too early I don't know if people when they see that they feel like they have to turn right there I haven't seen that when I watched the camera but that could be I I think um a good recommendation to take that out but then add another one pretty much east and west of the first driveway there which is pal drive but um that's what this drawing um so I'll just go through some of these other ones your your point about flattening this uh dotted white line well taken um and we were going to also add a a yellow dotted line to prevent try help guide the the motorists on the inside left turn lane on this then so they don't go into this thing but we would flatten that out too I think that's a good uh good point um so we were going to add the yellow daugh and guid line refresh the white go line guideline which again uh made a good point about making that flatter um refreshing the white skips here uh going east found uh eliminating this merge here but keeping this one and then adding another one right here um refreshing the the bike lane and the white Edge line just just while we're out there uh making sure those are visible um moving the this drop Lane sign is it's further west uh and it needs to be kind of right in line with for this merge it should be really here at the second one so so people aren't uh prematurely trying to merge um the the lane assign and sign up here going south uh it's there but there's there's a way we can maybe make it a little more conspicuous maybe put a um reflect retro reflective uh material on the on the sign post just to make it stand out a little bit there's other way we can make it more conspicuous um and then last but not least the the uh what you had spoke to earlier moving this stuff far back thank you Mr Roberts do you have any questions any comments we're going to give them just a second and then I'm going to go to council member Char Elliot and let her way in right now I'm on M can you hear me are you worth all this trouble I don't know was between there I took some aine dancing with a wobble wobble so when I get back I can show you how to do that all right do you have any questions or comments I do so kind of in summary just from my viewpoint obiously years ago we had a single left hand turn lanane with the medion on 13th and Fourth Street 13th and 14th Street then we went to a double left hand turn lane coming off of of um and making a left hand turn on the cost which we have now the one scenario we have actually not have physically is the single leftand turn lane on the colway boulevard without a med now I know you had questions earlier Mr Mayor concerning people coming off 13th and 14th grade and the county has a lot of data which they haven't had a chance to really see regarding how many Vehicles they things would typically queue up into that single Lane it sounded like earlier one of the gentlemen said you know he didn't really think it would even go past 13th Street in particular there may be some times when that happens right now I'm guessing they're still challenge if they're coming out of 13th or 12th and 13th Street and they want to make a left can turn out of their out of their street to head south and maybe either go further south or take the left to get on cway they still have a little bit of a challenge with that now even though it does provide them some safety because of the me but personally uh I want to get some more data and information and recommendations from the county if we go to that single Lane they did have some information on that and vehicles would queue up into that single Lane with the ability to have sometimes left hand turned with a bleaking yellow light I don't feel like there going to be a lot of times when those cars queue up so the people that live on 12 and 13 would have difficulty coming out of their street and attending to make a left turn so I for one would like to see that happen the county had told me before if we did that and for some particular reason later on we felt but you know what maybe this didn't work as well as we wanted to it's not that difficult for them to go ahead and put back the curving to create that Medium like it was before again alling to the safety of the two cars trying to make a left hand turn which I don't feel comfortable with thank you Mr Roberts let's go to council member Shaw Elliot well I want to thank both the mayor and the P for all their efforts because I think this has the presentation is a VI solution um I like the fact that it is preserving both um double lanes for the southbound left South I don't know right left southb left hand turns onto the causeway I think that's important to preserve I think it's also important to preserve the double left hand turn LS West BR and going south looks as though this solution to push back the crosswalks um eliminates the danger of of uh basically U colliding Vehicles as they're turning to go eastbound as well as hitting the people that are sitting there waiting to go um southbound cuz I've been in that situation where I feel like um to turn sou and black s a block I'm in a line of fire so I think all that works that sounds really good um I am concerned about pedestrian traffic so I'm open to any kind of observations that what how we can better preserve pedestrian safety in that as we push the causeway sidewalk back further east which again is a great uh move for traffic movement you then uh increase the risk that drivers going northbound and turning East will not see anyone in the Des cross so it's a blind curve for them to see anybody in that crosswalk so whatever we could do to improve that safety measure would be great and lastly I I would not favor eliminating the island and under your proposal that wouldn't be necessary but um the island is important I think for several reasons one is aesthetically it's just nice to have it and have some palm trees and and some Greenery um but more importantly it's also a safety zone for pedestrians so as you cross um Gul um there's a place where you can wait and save on that island and I think that's important so if you could address um how to make it more prominent that someone in the sidewalk for those uh Northbound East terms what we can do with that that would be great thank you council member Shaw Elliot um I'd like to hear from the city manager city manager reer what what are your thoughts my thoughts are to follow the County's recommendation I think that um they have all the technology to plug all of the scenarios into their models and uh they do this every day so uh if we have some other models we'd like to experiment with just to get that on I think that's the best course of action thank you Mr um you uh you have conversed more than anyone would you like to have some final words before we um before we let each two them go home sure uh thank you very quickly U thank you Mr Mayor um just so everybody knows we do have already two different uh pedestrian Crossings uh in our city that do not have a Medan so I know some some people think that all of them do two of them do not and there are some I know NS they've been removing them so I don't think from an aesthetic standpoint um that really really carries a lot of weight and I just want to go on the record because I feel very strongly about this about not continuing continuing to not have the two left hand turn l so I want to make sure that everyone understands I am 100% against that and I pray to God nothing ever happens but it does uh I want people to know that I was not for that when that accident occurred thank you thank you Mr Roberts Mr Mayor yes sir just just for clarifications uh Mr Thompson did you say how many feet was it that you had to get into you know I'm saying when you're going east how many feet did you have before has merg if if you go from two Lan to one lane with 35 milph and a 12T um lane two lanes to one lane about 250 ft 250 ft yeah and we have two Ls coming from the south that hold 12 cars each from the north from the north it depends on the size it might be a bigger vehicle it might be a truck so well approximately my my my software in my head an average car is 14.8 ft okay so let's say 15 ft * 12 180 ft you put 2 ft between each car I'm not a mathematician but I pick up dog poop for the county right you can only put so much poop in one bag right right and this is the problem you're you're trying to merge all these cars and there's not enough room that's it's it's a simple solution I don't know why we're making it so complicated thank you and what is your simple solution I think we should go back to where it was I agree with Mr Roberts if someone gets hit there I'm not going to be responsible right and and this Al you made a good point because when you are making that cross you move it back remember that it was people put that big wall there so now you got even more restriction people aren't looking they see that wall thank you very much all right gentlemen uh we look forward to hearing your uh uh if you Chang your opinion or whatever it is that you're planning on doing we would like to know what it what it is before it actually happens just to give us the opportunity to to talk about it and um present it to the community at at worst case all right yeah absolutely I appreciate the uh the time tonight I know this took a littleit longer than uh we anticipated but uh just like we've been doing we'll coordinate through Kyle and uh as we revise our drawings um we'll get we'll wait to hear from you guys before we take action we appreciate you being here and addressing this U long overdue conversation thank you J have a good night all right now we are up to uh item six finally the uh quarterly board reports starting with the board of adjustments Mr Kelly I'll I'll give you a couple couple of minutes to let clear clear out before uh you guys are fighting over the mic yes it's great welcome good evening mayor good evening council members my name is Mike Kelly and I'm the board of adjus chairman here report to you about the activity we've had in the last quarter um the last quarter but the hearing that we had 2 weeks ago is the only one for 2024 um last year we were overloaded with a bunch of pools a bunch of docks this year it's been kind of quiet and the case that we had was heard in June 13th was a front setback um as opposed to a dock or or a pool um other than that we were sad to lose one member of the board who resign our theme has resigned for board adjustment but it's on your agenda as you know upcoming soon for the candidate for an potential appointment as a new board member to fill our board for seven this board has two exil members um right now we only have one since one of had moved up to a full spot um and the second gentleman has chosen not to go for that particular U full-time app and as he travels too much he's not here enough so I I hope you see fit to appoint the gentleman that's on your agenda later for a fulltime position on our board um there is another hearing coming up August 1st for a situation on dado Drive um it involves a beach in one of those Coes that um I think there'll be a lot of activity and a lot of residents involved so we look forward to that thank you Mr Kelly uh do we have any questions or comments from the council Mr Roberts do you have any questions I have none thank you all right thank you Mr K appreciate you being here all right do we have anyone from the citizens advisory committee all right I don't have aort no report that's that's quite all right that's quite all right okay since we have no report from the citizens advisory committee uh let's move on to parks and R anyone here from Parks and R tonight that be me okay who we have can you hear me I can okay I'm Patty Roberts from 102 20th Street par so last time we were together gave a report um about we were looking for muralist to do a mural on the Morgan Park recroom walls so we have obtained a mirorless John colmer and he's presented sketches and that it's $1,500 per wall it includes the prep work the paint and the sealings and he's ready to begin work at the end of July there should be sketches in your packet and it shows for the Gum bouevard Wall there's a turtle that says welcome to B Peach and then there's the bathro walls which is facing south there's palm trees and for the Oceanside wall it's Dolphins can you see all those yes we can okay at this time we have 2500 remaining in our budget and I understand that that may be adjusted for the full cost of all three walls being completed at one time are there any questions I I have a question um was this ever going in front of the council to vote on according to to the when I was told it didn't need to be voted and last meeting when I told you about it you said you just wanted to see the sketches before we moved on that's my understanding so where we're at right now they have $2500 um that was allocated for the promotional EV that they haven't spent we didn't know exactly what this total price was going to come to so there is money that they typically use for their budget um available but if you're looking at $1,500 per wall you're going to need a little more um there is some just talking about repairs for the non departmental budget we've come under this year so there is some money to work with inside of that budget but it would be the council's decision to move forward so we can put it on as an agenda item if You' like to officially vot I'd like to hear each Council member's opinion on uh on this project yes uh thank you Patty this is Kim Shaw Elliot um I love the idea of the turtle um I think it it supports the work that a lot of people are doing in terms of saving the turtl mess in our community and so that's a great theme to to put out there um General comment on the Dolphins again love them it's great like the uh sea sea life on the side um just from this particular image can't really quite tell if the uh right side of the panel is empty or what's going to happen there maybe a little a little blank on that on the um palm trees not a big fan of those just because they look rather commercial um it just looks like something that might come out of a a pre pre-done purchase that you could make for um that kind of AG but uh thank you very much for this effort because I think it would be a great addition to Happ thank you Mr Roberts you're uh you're uh sitting there with Patty right now I'd like to hear you weigh in on this also U thank you very much I kind of feel that R is I'm on a vot so I am definitely in favor of yeah I think they that I know the the um they had a l of conversations with the muralist different ideas he seems to have some really good references um some buildings we've seen around locally here he look he does great work and as council member Elliot said um you know I think it would enhance the interance of more than part significantly so I'm in favor thank you Mr Robert let's go to Mr Banker Kyle how much money do we bringing on I should know this morg par uh for the toing year we budget in our our revenues about 150,000 that's that's average make a motion we $2,000 to this project I mean give them some back and I'm just asking questions the uh my my only concern is uh it's not necessarily um it's not necessarily about money um I'm trying to decide what we're what what is the goal of this other than beautifying are we calling people from go Boulevard to to come to Moran Park and spend their money uh on our beach I'm I'm just trying to grasp what it is we're trying to to accomplish I I love the idea of beautifying anything in belir Beach um but I'm not sure if we're saying calling all uh tourists uh to our private community so uh mie what's what's your thoughts on that well and you hit it with the beautification that's where we came up with the idea I knew they had just completed the cleanup of Morgan Park and we were trying to think of other things that we could do and that was the idea that we came up with and the welcome to Belair Beach is anybody that fools in there and they don't have to live in Belair Beach to park there but I don't feel like we're saying come on in we're just saying this is our beach and we think it's beautiful and the turtle idea was you know because we're trying to protect the turtles here on our beach that's why we chose the picture of the turtle what is the it's all about beautification what is the lifespan of the neural before it needs maintenance um he said 25 to 30 years wow all right um well this is b beach you know and there's a turtle you say welome um okay well I I really think that we should take a vote on it anyway just so that we go on record um I I'm just going to be up front about it I I like the idea of painting on three sides of the building I don't like the idea of that side um but U Can we go on record or is that good enough I think everyone else is in favor of it well I I agree change that but you know um we got three ideas from him and we wanted it to be simple but still very much in nature so if you have an idea for the bathroom wall side or we can just do the two sides everybody loves a manity and we de deated on the dolphin Manatee and Stingray so we could add one of the other you know the manity or the stingray I like the manity I'm I'm just I'm having a problem with the uh the GOL Boulevard side of of uh painting The Golf Boulevard side just because I don't want to attract more people to more depart um I think that we do we do well as it is and um that's just where I stand I motion we don't do that was the one that was the main one that people did see it I I have to agree with the mayor on you know this we try to keep this as private as possible I mean the 3-hour time limit I mean like that so we have a motion on the table I have a second what was the motion toor not to do golf W what if Queen just did the picture but not put belir Beach I think it's still um I'm sorry we have a motion on table right now we we have to decide if we have a second or not okay the motion dies all right uh well if that's the case it's sounds like um you you guys can do whatever you'd like with this uh with this mural okay thank you and we will um and continuing with my report in October we will be having the Shelly P golf um and it's going to be Football theme and it is scheduled for a weekend when the Bucks are playing out of town so we don't interfere with people that want to go to that game so everybody needs to sharpen up their recipes for chile and sign up to participate or either just come and eat believe our weekend we've chosen was October 13th that sounds good I happen to know somebody that makes good chili I know so you better sign up again all right thank you do you have an up a comment regarding an announcement about that oh yes yes thank you we also have a new activity that Miss sha Elliot presented called for cting and it is going to be once a month and I don't have my notes in front of me since where on this Ro believe it's July 29th is the first one it begins at 7:00 it will be on the back porch of the city hall and just come and visit with your neighbors you bring your own activities if you want we will have some cornhole set up and maybe a couple of other things long games but it's just a getting to know your neighbors similar to our picking up um litter on the beach but there's no work involved only fun so um that's July 29th at 700 p.m. the backside of City Hall thank you m Roberts I appreciate do we have any other questions or comments for this um Patty I was told there's no beach clean up this week uh Fourth of July and there was there were some people on the June I was there on June but there was nobody there for the June Beach is it going to be back to August now or yes the June room was up at City Hall instead that was posted on the um sign that they they met up in City Hall for the clean up behind City Hall that beach okay there's about six or eight of us that showed up in a 19 yeah that it was changed and that was and the what do you call online letter and on the sign but yes we cancel because the 4th of July and no one was no one was in town all right thank you Patty I appreciate it all right now we are up to uh let's see we are up to the now we're up to planning and zoning we have anyone from Planning and Zoning no the chair is out of town but he did provide a written report that was included in the packet all right well that concludes our reports and now we are on to number seven apparently Mr Mo build us so much that he didn't want to be here so he sent in one of his Partners to take the heat Randy gets to go on exotic vacations and here I said I report appreciate all right Mr Daniel I guess you're off the hook today I appreciate you being here this evening and uh now we're up to number eight city manager report Mr Reef for your up thank you may um R down the list Golf Boulevard undergrounding project um phase one we're ready for do to get started on that um there's nothing really in their way so it's it's completely on their schedule uh for phase two we have all the conduit in for the communication line which is Spectrum um get an update U to uh two Spectrum as far as when they're going to pull their cables we're still expecting that within the next couple months to be done within this uh fiscal here um we're sitting right now sort of at a um standstill with the easement requests um the uh consultant of project manager uh undergrounding uh utilities undergrounding Florida they they've been diligently trying to get the uh easement request from residents residents do not want to give easements for where Duke is um recommending that the equipment goes so we've asked Duke in our last meeting um for an alternative option um if they stand by that we need these evenements then i' I've asked them to come to one of our meetings to explain this and bring some of those residents in as well because they that's to we're going to get to the discussion of moving forward the uh star water Improvement project last Friday um the engineer Larry FL and I met with the contractor we are um in agreement of what they want um as far as getting those curbs in um um so that they can get them in the proper way the first time they install them so they've asked for that we do um give them the grades every 10 ft so they can have a surveyor out there stake the grades um um and then uh that way the first size measurements up and down each Street cuz it is a very difficult terrain to to install the curb um so the engineer doing all the work on the front end for them to go out there and uh resume the project our goal right now is we've approved for the paving to get done on a Morgan Drive 25th 24th and Cedar sprs and Palm Drive um those are all to uh they've all been approved by the engineers so that we can have the paving um completed and the uh you know grass and and papers restored for those residence are happy um it's been a long time for them to wait and then uh the first set of uh uh detail grading plans are going to get out are going to be 14th 15th and 16th I plan on uh meeting with uh the engineer and the contractor again to make sure that they have everything that they need um and then we can get out there and and resume the curent work the uh right now in the meantime I've asked them F CU they filled in front of the driveways with the road base um while we've been on standstill we as to fill the rest of the trenching just because we've been getting a lot of rain and I've noticed that we're kind of getting some some water sitting and we get ahead of it before we start getting some complaints on that the uh code review uh I've met uh for about 3 hours with Mr Sterno we went through all the recommendations he has everything he needs right now to start traing the ordinances um to then go to attorney MOA for his review but I plan on bringing workable ordinances for Council discussion in August um so that we can be thee of the game for um first reading after the the time period elapses for the hurricane un and then lastly our RFP auditing um Services we uh we met as an audit committee and there's a recommendation has an agenda item so we'll wait till later for that all right thank you do we have any questions or comments for the city manager I have a comment yes um regarding storm water Improvement projects um I wanted to point out that our plans have consistently said that N9 Street would have been handled last September um waiting a long time for that initiative to begin um we app the fact that we had considered uh and are still working on looking at uh the pump to augment the um thank you the Val um but um work was redirected North and I thought we were going to try to redirect it back to 9th Street once that work has been completed so I have that we thank you Miss Elliot any other questions or comments Mr reer would you like to address her concerns um I right now it has to go from 14th to 50th just cuz they already have been broken the curs been cut out and um they have gaps on the edge of their street so I think they're surprisingly varation um where we're at right now we get this figured outside they don't feel like it would be proper to to delay them from getting their Cur at this point and now it was delayed because of the plan for the PPS is that correct no this is this is delayed from the confusion on um how how we want the valley curb installed the contractor was out there with 1 that much worked for the first six streets we got to a point we got to that 23rd and I'm referring to 9th Street n oh so the nth Street was delayed originally because um yes the palm station but I do know right now um we have an idea of we were working on getting that requesting the easement from the property owner had no luck with getting back um we had the meeting with them but I haven't heard anything um back from that property owner um so at this point I want to direct um L flui to design to go through the road but um where we stand to the project as a whole um we have run into some problems with the design of the curve and what the contractor wants to install properly so that has kind of caused more delay than we expected um I do know when N9 street is is a very challenging Street being extremely flat so I know from discussions with Larry fluty there's some decisions that might need to be made to start the curve replacement on that street um so yes if uh the contractor is in agreement after we finish 14th 15th and 16th I can recommend that we go to Ninth Street but again that's not completely in our control all right thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager uh Ju Just A clarification n stre wasn't skipped because the pump issue it had already been skipped and and for some whatever reason I don't understand it went from 8 Street North after that street schedu um the pump is came later but thank you for the reminder Mr manager that um yes those streets were already open I don't know how they got up there in the first place we com back to N Street which is a disappointment but um not back but whatever you have to that project thank you Miss just just a comment um I think N Street will be the uh Pro the m city done I mean if we were going to proceed the way the original plan was go for the a to disaster I mean so hopefully your stre will you might have to wait a little bit longer I appreciate again learning Mr Roberts would you like to uh address the city manager no sir all good all right that's it and we'll move on to the city clerk report

all right now we are on to item number 14 this is for the city council selection of a professional audit Services firm and to authorize the city manager to execute an auditing Services agreement with the selected firm uh the audit committee's recommendation for City auditor is Wells Hower and Shel EA at the for the amount of $322,200 uh Mr reer you have the floor thank you mayor just as a recap we uh issued the RFB on April 19th and we received five uh proposals on May 31st of of those five four of them were within our budget range and the audit committee has met and discussed their rankings which they provided for um as well of the attachments to score sheets and in doing so they made a recommendation to have the firm Wells Hower and Shad pa um as the uh the awarded auditing firm and I've included uh B's Houser and shadel's proposal for youreview thank you Mr rer let's go to the citizens for comments on this topic would anyone like to uh address the council see as we have noncitizen comments are now closed Council I'm going to need a motion to I'm sorry wrong uh area here sorry um I'm going to meet a motion uh to to uh select an auditing service and to authorize the city manager to execute the auditing Services agreement with the selected firm I think that second what exactly did I say all right so that's quite all right I'm just giving you a hard time that's all right all right in the second was uh made by Mr Baker Miss Elliot you have the floor thank you um the the uh selection committee uh is the the standing committee for the says a Citizens advisory committee just forget the name I apologize for that the citizens advisory committee is um composed of a lot of very highly qualified people that uh did some very good work in doing this evaluation um so they sit as the audit committee and our ordinance provides that chair of the audit committee be a council member so I served in that capacity um each of the responses to the RFP were evaluated in full uh it was a very good process um each uh member of the committee made an evaluation of those responses based on the criteria that were presented in the original RFP those criteria are weighted and each one was tabulated for individual we talked through all of the issues uh and the ratings were compiled and the highest rated uh firm ended up being Wells housing um we talked a lot about all of the candidates qualifications um but we determined that here when we're selecting an auditor the individual qualifications aren't as important in the sense that all of them are going to have to be licensed CPA all of them are going to have to be able to follow the process all of them are going to be able to follow the um the accounting procedures so we looked at some qualif measures also qualita qualita measures also um this is a smaller firm which we like um our existing auditor was from a much larger firm and we felt like we were't getting the attention that we really wanted uh from our auditor um we feel like we can get the attention of the key decision makers and the key providers in this effort when it is a small because they're going to be the partners and not um a department head or a manager from a big firm's Department um he felt that uh this particular firm also represents many of our neighboring peer companies ium P communities and they include seal old Bar South Pasadena Belair BL and red Shores so they have a lot of experience in our space and the communities of our size um one thing that was very distinguishing about this firm is that they specified that the work will be done on site um many of the applicants um do this remotely and that can be very effective um there's nothing wrong with doing things remotely but being on site might provide some additional insights um as well as the fact that this particular firm our CFO used to work at so that we're guaranteed this is going to be but we're confident that this is going to be a very good veral um relationship um their fee for service was tegged at $32,400 that was not the cheapest of the responses but was all of them were within a fairly narrow range and was certainly within our projected budget of $35,000 so um definitely support this okay thank you council member Shaw Elliott do we have other comments from the council Mr Roberts no sir all right um I like the uh study that was done I think it was very thorough I read through the notes and uh and it seemed uh pretty obvious that um you guys did a great job and uh I'm just curious is there anyone here from The Firm this evening that would like to address the council yes sir please come up and uh and let's have your name and uh tell us a little bit about you and your firm excuse me thank you very much um thank you for the opportunity for our firm to have been able to submit our proposal and and um I'm ke shatzel from Wells hous shatel um our our firm and myself we have Ving local local governments over quite a long period of time um in addition to the uh to our current client based we had indicated in our proposal we had one time for a period of period of 10 years we had wanted to the city of T Springs but period of 12 years we going to so I do think that we do bring from a standpoint of a smaller municipality I think we we do bring a good Bas of knowledge um as was brought out we um and I've always felt this way as long as I've been practicing CPA and auditor that um doing an audit on site I think is very important I've used the phrase that if if if you're not here on site it's almost like you're trying to work in a vacuum and U as an auditor and being present in the client's offices you get to you get to basically get a sense of you get a sense of the tone of the top and you get a better opportunity to know the people and and I I think it just gives us a better opportunity to be able to serve you and if there areas where we where we feel we can make recommendations I think you're I think as laist we a lot more AP to be able to find those areas having a physical presence um I don't have too much too much else to add to that um I think you you'll find that we U I think we do a very thorough thorough job uh I've been accused of probably over auditing but I think if you're auditing local municipality and you're you're looking at how other people's money are being spent I think it's important and so we we have our approach to looking at excuse me looking at M is being dispersed we we take a broad stample so I guess I would conclude that again I definitely do thank the city council for the opportunity for give us the opportunity thank you Mr shatel and I agree with you that the uh the onsite audit is definitely the uh more streamlined more efficient way of doing things uh because you get caught up in this email back and forth constantly and we all know it's very time consuming uh sometimes it's a one one request at a time and it can it can multiply the amount of time it takes to get the job done uh whereas if you're in our business building that's uh uh much more efficient so I I greatly appreciate that and uh I definitely understand the attraction thank you very much for being here tonight do we have any questions or comments from Mr sh Mr Roberts no sir all right thank you sir and uh I guess now we will take it to a vot Renee council member Banker yes council member Roberts yes council member Elliot yes and mayor gavis yes so it's unanimous congratulations Mr shatel to you and your firm and we look forward to working with you all right now we
