case that we have tonight I will read the variance request then the city manager will give a staff report on behalf of the city and the applicant will be asked to come forward or their representative to the podium pull the pull the microphone down to make sure since we are recording this that um we can all hear you and you were welcome to make your your statement or your representative is is also able to make that statement at that point we're going to have open discussion with the board and with the applicat followed by that we actually vote on six different items for every case the board will be asked to vote and each of those items will be voted on individually by everybody up here we will then ask for a vote regarding the variance itself and then at that point we'll do a roll call to see if the variance passes or if the variance fails there any questions you can stop me at any time at this point we'll go ahead and ask for variance request number 23-4 for the owners of 120 14th Street and excuse me if I pronounce your name wrong but I believe is it ra and Mina shla yes thank you very much they're requesting a variance from division two swimming pools section 10-7 regarding the setbacks the Heights and the widths the height of a swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 in above the crown of the road any stru stral part of any permanently installed inground swimming pool or Spa shall not be built higher than 24 in above the deck including raise spaws full beams upper level decks and raiseed water PLS auxiliary deck mounted equipment such as hand rails ladders grab rails diving boards and slides shall not be subject to the height requirements set forth in this section their request is to construct a pool 62.6 4 in above the maximum height Allowed by the city code Patty have we received any correspondence at all for this case I had one phone call inquiring if the pool was going to be in the front yard and the backyard and that was their only question okay are any of the neighbors by chance of the applicant here this evening that would like to speak I know you've got a representative from your pool construction company at this at this point um I I'd like to ask uh Kyle now that I've read what they they are requesting to do Kyle if you'll make a report on behalf of the [Applause] city thank you chairman um so our city engineer H floody with j i engineering prepared uh he reviewed the the plans and prepared a a letter um stating what the uh variance needs are um he used uh everything in the in the measurements of feet uh I'm going to say it in inches because our code reference is 18 in might be easier to understand that way um so this is the property at 120 14th Street they they have an existing pool um that is a higher elevation than is allow by code the crown of the road um in front of the residence that the code referen is that is 22.2 in the existing pool deck now is at 86.4 in and this is inches above sea level um and the proposed pool um that the plans that are included in this packet um is going is requesting to be at uh 2.84 in above sea level given the crown of the road being at 22.2 in uh the maximum allowable by code uh elevation of a new pool is 40 in 40.2 in above the sea level so the proposed pool uh being at 10 2.84 in above sea level um they need a variance to cover an additional um 62.6 4 in above what is allowed by code so basically we're asking for something that's 5 ft higher than what we allowed by C 5T 2 in thank you one question on the 86 in that's is that sea level or is that from the crown of the road that's the existing is 86.4 in above sea level sea level excuse me the existing um is 46.2 in above what is allowed by Cod thank so how much higher above the existed deck as it stands now that they're looking to go they're looking to go an additional 16 uh 49 in above the current back 16 in 16 in above the current P yes okay thank you so the old one before the the representative comes up the old one as it gets torn out will be replaced by a higher board yes as as proposed as proposed okay any other board members have any questions before we ask for the owner's comments Mr you good good okay you folks are welcome to make a statement if you'd like or your representative is welcome to make a statement yes sir my name is Steve gerer I represent Cody PS um the biggest reason that we want to raise the pool to the height of the patio is the existing pool now has stairs and it's more difficult for the homeowner to enter in and out of the house down to the existing pool that's there so right now there's technically Three Steps from their existing house to the existing pool de so what we're asking for is to build the new pool to the height of the patio I know that it already exceeds what the current Co is but the pool already does so as he's saying we're asking for another 16 in more than what it is right now and then as far as the footprint of the pool the foot the new footprint of the pool is smaller than what's actually existing there concrete wi some of the existing concrete is as close as 3 ft off of the seaall nowhere anywhere with the new project would be any Clos to them I think it's 11 or 10.9 somewhere in that range so you didn't have to or you don't plan to alter the typex no sir and I have a letter that I turned in with the um package that has a copy for my engineer on the seaw wall okay so let me do you have your full plan in front of you where your elevations are I I did yes sir you're showing an actual finished elevation on the pool of 8.57 yeah the spa would be 9.57 and then the pool would be 8.57 okay so the spa up another foot yes and your pool deck um will will finish as as you'd like to have it finish at the 8.57 even with the the cover porch yes sir okay do everybody on the board understand that you've got step Downs all over the place once you flank the pool um so that will take them down approximately what is it steeve about 4 ft on the back side yes at the water level correct okay um any other comments on your behalf I I think that makes it clear yes I do have copies of the survey highlighting the existing pool and the proposed new pool along with pool construction drawings if anybody like to see it I have all of that stuff so you have demolition contractor lined up yes sir pending the approval of the variance that's all we're waiting on yes sir okay have you applied it all yet for anything we we did apply for the application and then we this is as far as we've gotten yes sir okay again any questions from um board members the um on either side of the deck this be North and South drop off and then you're at the grade of the land right yes sir their intent is to put um glass wall you know obviously for trip fall purposes all the way around that's going to get installed anybody in the audience want to speak on behalf of this case Mr gu thank you very much thank you at this time board members I'd like you to go ahead and take out our criteria sheet and I'd like to ask our vice chairman Jan Goldman to go ahead and ask the questions on our behal we will be asking ladies and gentlemen six different questions for which you must receive um um a yes vote to move forward with the with the VAR so number one have you demonstrated that the special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District did the requesters need that approved is a yes and no is a deny Mr Beam no Miss conry no Mr Elia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatli yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes pardon yes that's three no votes and four yes votes number two number two have that demonstrated that the variance request is the minimum variance that will make it possible for the reasonable use of the land building or structure yes equals approved no denied Mr Beam no Miss conry yes Mr ellia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatli yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Cy yes two no and five yes number three have they demonstrated that granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter yes equals approved no equals denied Mr Bean no Miss conry yes Mr ellia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatl yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes two no five yes okay number four have they demonstrated that the variance requested does not change the use of the property from the use characteristics mandated for districts 1 and two in sections 3051 and 94-25 and Article 4 division 3 of this chapter yes equals approved no equals denied Mr Beam no Miss conry yes yes yes thank you Mr Alia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatl yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes two no five yes number five have they will they comply fully with the additional conditions and safeguards which the board of adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for this variance is required shall commence and or be completed yes equals approved no equals denied Mr no Miss conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatl yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes one no six yes okay number six they demonstrated that the variance requested does not violate any provision and requirements set forth in chapter 62 and chapter 74 of the city code yes equals approved no equals denied Mr Bean no Miss conry yes Mr ellia no Mr Gardella yes Mr Gat yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes two no five yes I'd like to ask for a motion requesting the board to weigh in on or vote sorry weigh or vote please I we need a motion I'll make a motion to approve the variant request number 2304 do we have a second second okay I'm Sorry Miss Goldman who second did I couldn't tell thank you Tony G Mr Beam no Miss conry yes Mr Alia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatli yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes 2 No 5 yes folks your variance is approved so we wish you the best Steve move forward with Kyle as soon as possible yes good luck going up to water to get your your building from from the town thank you very much for your time thanks for coming uh I just want exp my highest thanks thank you very much good luck our next variance request is number 2305 the address is 305 Harbor Drive and the owners again I hope I pronounce it correctly Demetra and Constantino help me on the last Ste the okay the requesting of variance from chapter 30 which is our marine structure chapter plans of specification regarding plans and specifications the length of a residential D shall not exceed 30 ft from a seaw wall or waterfront property line involved to allow an exist your requested to allow an existing residential do 31 ft farther from the seaw wall than Allowed by Cod this point Kyle could you come on back up and give us a city report staff okay thank you this is for 305 Harbor Drive uh this Mar there's three variance requests uh in it's for exist in Dock and Boat Lift so it's required to have three variances from the code uh to replace what they're asking to replace the existing boat lift with new boat lift and the reason that they need the variant um is because the dock itself is longer than is permitted by code the lift has pilings that are further out that permitted by code and the um projection of the property line it's closer than what is permitted by code so talking about the length of the dock um the existing dock is 61 ft from the seaw wall um the code provides that a dock can be 30 ft from the seaw wall um with an extension of a 15t catwalk um the way the dock is designed the dock is technically um the dock structure 61 ft from the seaw wall um and that's on the existing dock they're doing nothing to that dock but they do need a variance because the lift is part of that dock so they need a variance of an additional 31 ft from the seaw wall to keep the the existing dock then the next variance is a variance to allow the existing um oat lift voice to have elements filings out at 69 ft from the seaw wall the code provides that um boat hoist be expended far than 45 ft from the seall so this would be 69 C8 variance to extend the boat hoist um an additional 24 ft in the SE and then the last variant is um one dealing with the uh property line projections and the way that the lot is shaped be look at the parcel is it's kind of a a pie piece getting skinnier towards the seaall so when you project out the property lines they kind of squeeze in um this uh but at the distance Where The Boat Lift is um which is the uh 69 ft from the seaw wall um you project those property lines out instead of being 12 ft away from that property line is only 9 ft away so they're asking for a variance to be 3 ft closer to that rejected property line on the sou side of the property um and again that's no closer than what the existing situation is any questions from the board yeah right so I understand they're not replacing the duck they're just replacing the four pylons and 10,000 lb live yes in the exact location that is currently at light for okay thank you is this because this is an ancient variance from a long time ago um the doc the original doc was built before uh the current code was adopted so the code got more after theop was installed and to your knowledge that is there any interference because several of the board members that are all voters David lives on my are we interfering whatsoever with that first 25% on on this property um I have computer for that reason open 305 Harbor is right here so where the parcel's highlighted as you can see it's open water they across the channel there so no interference you zoom in a little bit take it in so the doc comes out and there's D thing waste to left you can see all the proper L projects this way leave that on the screen if you look for a minute David comments Tony no I'm actually surprised it's even 9 foot from that extended property line the way that looks so that's good all right well I'm not extending anything it's exactly where it is now that was my question thanks I have a question so Kyle the existing bat now is 9 ft from the property line on the South Side yes and are they asking to go further out if you said it was 61 now it's going to be 69 for the new one or is it going to be the same distance so the dock um right here where it ends is 61 ft and then the boat Co is a little bit further as the way it exist now so that's B exact same dock it's the same and there's already docks on either side of that relatively the same the same length so yes there other dos that are longer than theod one more question so this was put in prior to a board of adjustment hearing when it was originally put in right they don't have variance from that correct thank you and the variances are all good for he any any other questions yeah I have a question because where it talks about um voice of bed and you need to this property is it not going to be unique to other properties as time goes on I'm looking at the info that they've explain why the is needed um the properties vary as you go along these the sea walls there definitely are some that have more Pro o events and Sh water I can't speak exactly do not continue to grow will there be another Vari that it continues to grow I don't know the answer to that thank would the applicant or representative of the applicant care to come forward please introduce yourself and pull the microphone down if you need so we can hear better okay thank you yes hi I'm Lisa Ryan with advaning construction and I am here uh representing MRI and her husband um we are proposing as you have mentioned to keep the existing Dock and LIF in the exact same position it's in right now just to swap out the vot LIF on new polls any questions or while this while it's up on the screen I yes are you seeing it behind us or we're seeing it back over here um whether K an is this and you answer this David has lived on that Canal for years and years I lived down on Harbor Drive for 18 years forther north of where that house is all of us as voters are always concerned about shs and as you come around that corner that's that's a tough one I realize you're not going out any further but Kyle how how far across is it to where you you come are you familiar familiar with that or David you can probably Chim in on this one well from where it starts getting shallow there on that picture it's probably 60 ft 80 100 ft I don't know are you saying from the dock to yeah there's a actal channel that runs which is nice to where it gets darker there yeah it shows in real bad on that right side and I did not measure that no I don't know that exactly okay well the fact that it's existing is is helpful because to obviously get into that greater percentage of that 25% that you're allowed um when that venturing into that particular area so in terms of H hazards and navigation guys I guess we're not dealing with that no the only thing I would say since you guys live down there is there any worry about moving out as far as they did at a low tight far safety and building nobody runs ground no because the existing do that's been there we all avoid it coming in because it it even starts one or two houses to the South and I think one or two not even in that in that shot it's consistent okay thank you at this point we'll go ahead and and do our questions for uh criteria worksheet Jane if you take over Sor go ahead I'm sorry and um you guys didn't SAR me in I'm a lawyer so you want to swear me in because I came in 3 minutes late so you got to swear the sorry I just feel bad it's like I feel like I'm lying or um wait yeah that one do you solemnly declare airm that the testimony you're about to give these proceedings is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I do thank you so um I just wanted to say that um we've owned it since before my first son was born so um it's real shallow out there and it would deem if you guys don't do this tonight it would deem it like pretty much unusable and we as you know we're not trying to change anything we just want them to replace the the lift so that we can use it and it is it's just really sh you guys know from being out there so and then we do it's a nice thing is we do have that nice Channel out there so I don't think we're bothering anybody anym than anybody else is there we're trying our best so neither one of us is running your dck not yet keep our fre PRS cuz we can't even rebuild it after that thank you thank you anybody else want to speak J it's yours okay so variance requests we're going to start with 23-05 the first question is have have they demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure of building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same Zone in District yes equals the variance is approved no equals denied Mr Bean I miss conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Cardella yes Mr Gatlin yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes number two uh they demonstrated that the variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land building or structure yes variance approved no variance denied Mr Bean yes Miss conry yes Mr ellot yes Mr Mr Cardella yes Mr gatl yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes no question number three have they demonstrated that granting the Varian requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter yes equals approved no equals denied Mr Beam yes Miss conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr G yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes question number five will you comply fully with additional conditions and safeguards which the board of adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for the Varian is required shall commence nrb completed yes the variance is approved no it's not approved Mr Bean yes M conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatl yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes and um Miss Goldman I skip question four yes ma'am okay okay sorry question number four was did they demonstrate that the variance requested does not change the use of the property from the use

Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes question number six they demonstrated that the variants requested does not violate any provision and requirements set forth in chapter 62 and chapter 74 of the city code yes equals uh variance approved no equals variance denied Mr Beam yes Miss conry yes Mr Elliot yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes 7even yes so we need a motion motion second somebody like to make the motion I make the motion that has approve okay thank you can I get the motion in a second was that Miss conry was a motion and Mar Mark was second thank you is for number 2305 Mr Beam yes Miss conry yes Mr ellia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes M Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes variance number 2305 is approved we're coming to part two okay we got three to go we got to do this again twice we know the show's not too terrific we got to do it again so bear with us that's right Varian request 23-6 first question is have they

yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes so i' would like to make a motion that the Varian is um approv approved we have a motion by Mr Goldman and we have Mr Gardell or Mr Bean for a second Mr Bean yes Miss conry yes Mr Elliot yes Mr Cardella yes Mr Gat yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes Lisa and Demetra um thank you for your patience on this all three variances are approved you're welcome to move forward with Kyle and our permanent procedure and again water of navigation up in Clear Water and we wish you the best thank thanks Kyle okay that moves us on to our third variant request of the night at 9007 harbard drive it is varant we have two variances coming up for number 23-8 to construct a dock to encroach 25 ft farther into the navigable waterway that allowed by city code Mr Brown I presume this is yours okay um the second variance we'll hear is 23-9 same address requesting a catwalk construct Dock and cwalk 15 further along 15 further out 15 further longer than the Allowed by City Cod the floor is yours okay so this is at 907 harder drive it's requesting two variances um the first variance uh uh addressing the 25% um encroachment more than 25% into the navigable Waterway uh the engineer looked at the plans looked at the are to so that is 97 haror and when the engineer calculated the navigable Waterway you got a distance of 140 ft that distance he calculated from the land to the bir Island is 140 ft um he just his explanation when I asked was he wanted to make sure he check all the boxes of what could be um interpreted as inable Waterway as you can see it's you know a couple probably 3 400 ft off of Bird Island to the north the property um but that is how he determined that they need a variance of um an additional 25 ft because he calculated that 25% of 140 is 35 ft and then the dock itself with the catwalk extends out 60 ft so there' be a variance of 25 ft further okay but it's fairly Open Water right off Mr Brown's duck yes I just wanted to find it out um and then when it comes to the plans for the dock yeah an existing dock that you can see he currently has a lift at the East end of it but what his plan is called for is extending the catwalk off the end of this existing 30 ft to get out deep enough to put the lift for the boat to be um so our code allows you to construct the main 30 ft from the seaw wall and then um you're allowed 15 additional feet from the dock as long as it's 4 ft or less in width of a catwalk um that is not enough he's proposing doing an additional 15 ft from the dock so it be 30 ft of catwalk um to extend the lifts out so again that's a variance of 15 ft longer B the Cod any questions from the board how long is a dock out now Kyle I mean the farthest Pile in there is supporting that lift is that 45 [Music] ft the do was 30 and it looks like it would be under so the dock for itself goes out um it has like a a dock that runs uh parallel to the seaall um that is 4T from the seaw wall and then from there so this is 4T and then it goes another 26 ft to the end so that's the third and um judging by this if you just look if this is about halfway looks like the leftt doesn't go prob go out right for I don't have the existing plans that's fine and we're looking for another 15 ft past that point yes zo that okay so they're confirming that the lift is within that 45 ft from the SE ex same for system any questions anywhere Al can you just pull push it in a little bit so I can see the navigable water on the side there just a little bit you don't have to you come in even more just so you can see what's going on in the right okay that's perfect and then this this is part of the parcel they actually have some submerged land so this cutting in like this doesn't apply to the distance of the dock off the property line because the where the code reads is it's projected out like this so on the second variance we're not really worried about the 9 ft where the propop line and the 9 ft is iser so saying we do have the 12 they do have the 12 okay um thank you Mr Brown Mr Ryan either of you carry come up hi thank you my name is Scott Brown uh we purchased a home in middle of February I've been trying to work on uh a suitable plan since then the issue is that the the water around the dock and at the end of the home there is very very shallow it becomes dry land completely dry land about 20t Off the seaw Wall uh in low tide there's also an abundance of SE grass in that area so I had originally looked at trying to move some of the sand out of the way and create some dep Dred it Dred it but the but the county uh spoke of concerns because of the seagrass in the area so they would prefer us to give the variance for l so so that's why we're asking for this variance um the property the navigable Waterway there uh there there's really two that are directly behind the home there's there's an East West navigable waterway that runs all the way out to the main channel uh in the harbor and then there's a north south that everybody's familiar with runs right next to here so that area is extremely wide uh and in terms of navigable Waterway out there there's there's my estimate and measurement uh was in excess of 400 ft from the seaw wall behind my house so there's there's a lot of water back there uh that's deeply navigable uh and as Kyle mentioned the the navigable waterway that the engineer spoke of was to the island but the island is nowhere near my property is 7al hundred ft to the South um um so we we really are just looking so that we can use the dock in low tide uh and even mid tide preferably we would have a request of 25 ft to to ensure that we could use the lift at all tie levels but the the variance application ass us for the minimum so that's why we are seeking 15 it will probably prevent me at some points in time with extreme low Tides from using the lift uh but I think that's a pretty rare occasion and so that's why we're requesting 15 ft so we're trying to to be as reasonable uh and keep it as short as we can uh from that and I just also want to note that in our application our neighbors have reviewed the plans and improved uh the plans and agree with those Mr BR you are correct this this board looks very um realistically what the minimum request variance request is um that that's very fair if you need the 15 ft that's that's what we'll consider some people are shot for the moon and and the whole variance goes down right so your application is commended thank you I appreciate that I I also just want to uh introduce as well John McKenna who is

Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes 1 no six yes Mr Brown congratulations you got your variances we move forward and uh deal with water and nav and go from there Mr McKenna while you're here we're going to pick your brain would you please come to the podium for a couple questions that will help not only our board members but our city manager because the the U your letter is terrific and in the past this city has had to deal with u maintenance dredges sure um on a city level um this where I show my age we actually had a sandbar out here past Mr Browns area that David you'll remember showed in so bad that we approached the Army Corps of Engineers for approval and they were dragging their feet and we started doing the legislatures cuz all all we wanted was a maintenance dredge we had clean fill we we checked all the boxes and the core of engineers said no um at that point we said cuz when it show in the currents blowing under the bridge going north where I don't know KY can you pull that down we'll even show the bridge to where giant to get a better shot of it cuz it's still the SAR is still there David isn't it yeah it comes out you can see our narrow get jump and that's where the currents start ripping a lot of nonresidents were fishing on The Sandbar um and we actually said what's it going to take for for us to be able to to get this approved penel County agreed they would do it where our land is outside here we were willing to put the fil over there and and have it all the way no charge to the city Kyle you may have heard a little bit about this but this this got to be quite an issue and ironically a man who was fishing there over Labor Day weekend in 2003 or 4 I can't remember drowned he he he slid off the um off the U Sandbar um his body was found just north of the bridge um I got a call from the police chief at the time because I happened to be mayor and he said you have to do an interview with Channel 13 we just lost the person drowned because of that sample you'd be amazed how fast the Army Corp of Engineers gave us the approval for a maintenance dredge can you kind of explain what a maintenance dredge is I know Mr Brown had to encounter too sure sure um a maintenance dredge uh the State of Florida has their own definition of it uh D county has a similar definition arm cor Engineers also has their own definition um but essentially it's any navigable Channel A Boat Basin um a moing area anything that was dredged essentially artificially and normally the way that we determine that we're putting our permit together is going back through historical aals um you know if we can go back to the ' 50s 60s even the 40s and show that something was dredged then it's EAS maintenance stretch um the other caveat is for the state if an area fills in the point where it's no longer navigable they will not consider that maintenance and it's essentially a new dredge because I can't say that was our first maintenance dredge um but it had gotten to the point where it was dangerous for even a Boer to try to get through there kayaks to get through there because the currents were rippled um Mr Brown the current still bad going through there I don't yes sir it's pretty strong through there yes so because you have SE grass does that virtually wipe him out from doing it yes well it was partially seagrass and partially because the Mr Scott or Mr Browns moing area was never dredged itself the adjacent north south channel was um and panel's county for private citizens will not allow new drudging they would only allow maintenance dring um and then on the state and federal side and yes they were concerned about the SE grasses um and they the state may possibly have parented it with some mitigation uh but the Army Corp Engineers most likely would not we we had gone through about 6 months of denials so that must have been our initial request for maintenance dri uh yes and then did they issue the city of main eventually sure did okay well now that you have it it should be easier to get in the future from the agencies kind would this be our second one or is it been I don't think there's been one since that that initial one in 2002 or three I don't know anyone s s but um want Look Bar any IDE we we haven't had a never heard of any any dring going on there the key to why the county agreed to do it basically for free we gave them a um staging era for the for the film it was right outside here just south of the bridge where now is b a zbo slab up there um so the county was thrilled with that um I think Army Corps of Engineers um did it because somebody died um and they took that and of course it was on television and legislators were all over um the the Army Corp of Engineers etc etc so the county ultimately after it dried out all Phil was here for two weeks for 3 weeks all that water ran out they hauled away um which gave us some new life for that chall and is now choking again so I I I bring this up because your letter um highlighted maintenance Dred as what Mr Brown could have possibly done but um didn't have to B our action tday so just one more thing though you um indicated in your letter that the there's precedence that already that other people have already got their docks way past the code yes there are some docks down to the South that looking back through the Aerials in our measurements look like they were they were further out okay Tony you get some neighbors that have been dredged too haven't you no no we haven't not not since I've been there now did I misunderstand you or did you say that ums County will not issue a dredge for private citizens they will not issue any new dredging areas um if it's if it's an existing Channel or Boat Basin they will issue a maintenance dredge permit um but if that area has never been dredged before um uh Connor Petron with pel County Water navigation was who I spoke with um and he indicated that in very rare circumstances if you can show that you're providing a public benefit of some sort they would allow new dredging but he also said that was essentially limited to public peer stocks buil ramps it would be very difficult he said for a private uh citizen to do that so in Mr Brown's case if he did not have the SE grass and he needed to dredge it the county would not and he never had a Dred in the past the county would not issue him a per correct correct cuz it was never dredged that's good to know Kyle have any citizens approached you lately for a maintenance dredge I haven't seen a Dr come through Perman over a year I know Fred and Tony have got neighbor um up close to the corner of of U Alita I guess up on um dado and one or two back um where it showed in so bad John um yeah they've got beaches behind their house 40 ft of beach interested enough your old house okay my neighbor right he had a dredge done within the last year and a half for his C he's got a 45 foot C ran out there and he applied for a Dron per I don't know what he got to do to get it I don't think he had any Cass issues where he was at he just they Dred out from last year right next door they have rain of barge no they they pumped it out and pumped into a truck there at the street U specifically for his boat that's there he took 3 or 4 ft out of but that means he must have had a maintenance Str in the pass correct yes yeah was probably an excavated slip at some point we're dealing with some residents who need real bad and it's going to drop cars well yeah we've uh you know the last two or three years we we've done a lot of Permitting for that type um mostly in manyy County but it's uh it's become a very popular thing everywhere kind then obviously they have a d not like they have to come before us for variance of any kind do that wouldn't need to be notless thing we denied by water navigation yes you get along with the people in FLIR water then we may see more of it any other questions John thank you very much for your information sure thank youc um thank you we entertain a motion to adjourn if there's no further business before the board we Mr G Mr OT J"
