    "transcript": "okay i'd like to call to order the wednesday may 12 2021 meeting of american rec board um secretary seuss could you please take okay here devlin is absolute today she got funded at work so um i'll forgot to do the same stuff kyle i'm here perfect so we have quorum we're good um then item number one on our agenda's day is approval of the agenda for today so can i have a motion for sober here so we approve the agenda yes and everybody has a copy yes perfect yes okay and then let's see all right so um and then item number two on our agenda can we approve the minutes from the april 14th 2021 board meeting they have motion and the whole seconds are perfect item number three citizen comments we don't have any citizens here today so we are moving on um item number four on the agenda um nor do you have any updates on the 501c3 paperwork sort of um i called a few tax attorneys and they're really totally sent out like i'm not going to really be able to say but the bare minimum is going to be a thousand dollars and it's very possible that it would be a thousand dollars for them to fill it out could i try to figure this out on my own i'm not sure yeah possibly but it's going to be a lot of work i think it's [Applause] [Music] to speak to the attorney but now you know what the meetings are like and it's really not a forum for you to speak to him no not during that time i would like to ask to speak to him was that his only time here i mean that's the time if in the meeting he's here so that if you just bring it up and ask you don't have to talk directly to him to make sure that everything is accurate and correct during the meetings and that's it and that's where he walks out no i mean during the meeting you you know if you're up and you're mentioned or asking a question if you can ask like at the surface of the council park and record you're supposed to talk to everyone as a group you can ask the council they always say not supposed to address someone directly you know honestly our mayor is an attorney why doesn't he help us with the paperwork are you gonna ask him it's more of this is a conversation i would not like to hold up everybody's time for and i think it would just be a five minute conversation with the attorney if it's a yes or no it's a question well if it's a five minute conversation honestly you can ask it well we can be like presented at our next meeting like our next quarterly presentation in front of everybody and you can say this is what we're thinking about doing and you can have your two questions prepared i have one question are you willing and able to help us set this up instead of a 501 c3 yeah and you know what and that is going to turn into a much bigger what do you want it for and that's going to that's what i mean is going to be it will but there's no reason to set it up if like once we present it that happens anyway and they say no we might as well do have the initial conversation see if we can get some assistance from him with the paperwork and then if it gets cut down i'd rather be cut down before we do the paperwork than after yeah who's going to be filing this every single year well and that's the other thing you know we just kind of we've left it on there and we kind of had it on like the bathroom as far as like we're going to give ourselves six months and if if it comes to fruition we can present it at the jazz fest like maybe because when the band takes a break we can have the mic for five minutes um and just kind of let people know that it exists no pressure um but if it's like a ton a ton a ton of work and it seems kind of like it is because it just kind of it's not so much work as it is i think a little bit of money to start it up and then it's going to be worth to upkeep it it's just finally it's just responsibility it's just filing and it needs to be i think it's a good idea to have i just think it should be the cities and it should be ours and i think that you're telling me that that's enough i don't think your neighbors i don't think the city's gonna go for it no one's gonna be willing to do the work so we might as well if it's like not our board and we really don't have because even like the um which was the community that had it before the garden club like they discovered it because it was too much work and they didn't like tracking the money and filing all the reports so we don't want to cause a bigger headache for ourselves we said right from the get-go we're going to start small and try to just build up a couple things going to think so like maybe this was a good idea but we got too far over our skis like too soon so like if we don't have anyone to help us which it doesn't really sound like we do and it's maybe we should just table it for another time and you're more than welcome to make that motion and we can just vote on it it seems to me that somebody outside of this is that i really think it should be the cities and stay with the city say i move next week you know i don't want to take that with me and i don't want to take that away from the city i think it should forever stay with the city and i don't think it's that big sort of a headache for the city if especially if it's working and then they can like they can chop that off i don't think so well you know that's the council yeah okay yeah it is because i don't think it makes sense for me to be holding this as my own and my own club because i need like the city and i want it to stay with the city i don't want to transfer these funds to anywhere else or do i want to distribute these funds to a garden club or whatever other club that's going i want it just solely for this city so i think it should stay under the city's roof and not my name but i it wouldn't be your name you're just doing research at this point but someone's going to apply for the tax market well it would be the name of the like the name of the nonprofit would be nora kodak it would be the name right that's my understanding but i would be you have to have something you have to have a whole chair yeah you have positions positions and that's why lynn kept saying you need a different board or like you can have the same members but it can't be the parking record it has to be you have to create a home you have to create your own board so and as soon as you didn't have it it would mean all these hours of conversation would be like hey this is not going to work or it's only going to work if we do it this way and then we're done i really don't want to have that conversation with the entire i think the attorney would actually have to research it too i don't know if he knows that much about setting this up and the only people that we know that did it is not just setting it up but more the logistics of it can the city hold this how can the city do this you know how could we we probably have to look into it i don't think he knows but again that's a turning time so you're he's being awesome no but he's i know you're okay with this it's not my personal like oh my name is you know what i mean it's not it's something that's benefiting so that's why i'm okay with it i'm okay with using that because it's so that they have to approve it i know you're okay with it okay so then i'll think about whether or not i want to because he's gonna charge the city by the hour on top of the thousand dollars that you're already talking about so i think that's what you're talking about i'm saying yeah like the council would have to be on board with this yeah he charges us by the hour and not a uh okay yeah so he's just kind of um i think there's a built-in amount that he does in addition okay so we'll table it for now okay sounds like everybody's good with that okay so um item number five so we have quite a few i have several updates on this number okay so the activity calendar you know we're moving along um item number one is the jazz so we voted on the date to be september 20 that saturday so i did reach back out to the jazz band and i said we can't do it in may obviously i did that a while ago i said we'll get you another date this is the date that we voted on and um so the 25th it's saturday the 25th at 5 p.m and did we say five to eight or five or seven i thought we said five to eight because before it was um 12 to three so we voted on a three hour window so five to eight he said that was no problem but because it moved from a daytime slot to a nighttime slot the price went from 625 to 800 i told him i didn't think that would be an issue but i needed to check with the board so is everybody okay with that we do have it in our budget so um i don't is it something we need to vote on or if everybody just gives me a verbal we're good with it because we already come back on the whole thing i think you're good with it yeah george are you okay with 800 versus 625 because it's a 5 pm event and they charge more for saturday evening we want to do it we have the money we haven't spent a dollar really okay so perfect yeah and it goes away yeah so okay so that's we're good with that so it is officially september 25th from 5 to 8. um like i mentioned last time i did research these mailers and honestly they don't the prices i'm getting is like six cents a piece and then they'll do the postage so i'm actually going to try to start a proof and get a price and get it in the proof stage and have it ready for the next meeting and what i was thinking if you guys are okay with it is um you know like here's anthony my neighbor and this is a view from their you know back whatever so i was thinking it would be we could do some white or maybe and then maybe put the logo on it i know we need approval for that and then just say um something about you know fellow beach residents looking forward to meeting you all at these upcoming events or i'll figure out the burger or whatever and then i'll get the proof back for our next meeting and then i'll pass everybody around a copy we can tweak it as we want and then we'll know a price and then we can have them made and then literally we just give them our zip code and they'll go out to everybody and i'll have a final price so we can everybody is good and as far as size i'm thinking i mean i get as all of you do a million of these a week and i'm thinking this size is fine so what we can do is jazz fest on one side and then we can do the um the pets and christmas christmas like all the other stuff on the other side and then so they'll we only have to send out one and then so they'll have this and then they can just flip it over so okay so i um like i said i've researched a couple of different companies because some of them you can have them made and um you do the postage and others of them they just make them you give them the zip code they send it to everybody in the zip code and then you're done i'm kind of leaning towards that just because we don't want to deal with the addressing of them so it'll just be zip code it'll say resident or whatever and that's totally fine i think will they send the dollar show or two are they are um saying hey they're yeah that's the only thing in our zip code um how do you guys how have you i don't have to ask the land we're doing somehow because we don't send our stuff to them what's the business who's that with the publication other one i just had you know honestly i don't um i don't have those notes with me if you can look at it and tell me who made it i don't know like i looked at all of them and i couldn't find a number or a comment oh okay well sir speedy spot i adjust that yeah and so does um vistaprint there's a ton of them but this so okay so what anthony did anthony cheated so anthony just had these made with vistaprint or something and no postage and he went around and putting him in and the the mailman went behind him pulling him all out it's illegal and he and he he literally said do you know who this guy is i said he's my neighbor he's 25 years old he i'll let him know to stop doing it don't find him 500 he said okay fine so we're not going to do that we don't want to pass them out so if you can maybe check and see like how you know if we can't avoid bella or shore we can't avoid bella shorts like the guy's gotta be away yeah sister speedy avoid them just like it is it's three three seven eight six and then there i looked it up the other four there's also a four digit behind it however the verbiage of what is what was too far beyond my head and i couldn't do it because someone was asking me what my furniture was for and i couldn't provide it because i couldn't understand it wasn't a map cut out you know it was uh north of the south of this would you know why northeast north and west but it was still just it wasn't i could help with that so there's a way to immediately could you kind of let us know because yeah i'll find out for the next yeah and then because i don't have to give them the zip code it's gotta be okay yeah and we don't understand i mean i think bell or sherpa think it was weird at this point that we're sending them invites to things even if we wanted to invite them i think they would be like what the heck i know it's a trap mr speedy yes so the probably the first person to start with to get a quote would be search meeting because the city already uses them okay and if they're able to do it it's probably less of a hassle yeah and their prices are pretty good okay perfect and i don't know if i don't think like research them but also that's where and they're right here they're like local okay i know that's even better okay so then um the next thing in regards to the jazz fest so like i was kind of doing um research for my skin care suite and i signed up as you know somebody for this and i'm just going to pass this around and you can look at it while i'm talking about it so i sent this picture to patty and i i said could you please check with lynn and ask if we could get clear with the white cap and then get our logo printed on them they had the deal of the day so they were very like 400 it was very inexpensive like maybe under 200 and that would be our giveaway at the jazz fest so for the first 100 residents that walked in they would get a cup with bellar beach on it just as a thank you for coming and lynn approved it and said just sent kyle the info so but this is the thing with those deals of the day like you have to do it in like five minutes or they're gone so what i'm doing is i'm researching other companies that can possibly print those for the same price that you know you have a contact or whatever and then the other thought was just throw that down there so i thought these were cute too we could get white bags with this bellar beach logo on it and if we can get them for around the same price point they're just like to collect shells or i want to get your guys opinion on the cups but if we have like a little if you spend a little bit of money on hey thank you for coming um here's our giveaway because we're not doing any food or anything like that i think it would be nice if we did something any beverages just water if you remember we can go back and revisit like the like if we want to do i mean what i'm going to do gatorade pop i mean we're not going to do like big things of lemonade like you would at a house party though so i don't i mean i don't know what we would get individual containers which will be expensive and what do we get do we get like 7up or sprite or pepsi or coke like i just think water and then people are bringing their picnic baskets with their beverage of choice and their cheese and their french bread and their fruit bowls that's how i picture it and then like i'd rather spend our money on something that like they don't drink and leave garbage all over we it's uh because when we were doing it in may all of that was off the table because of copen now september that could be a different story but like again every single thing we do one of us has to man the table one of us has to stand there and physically do it for the entire three hours so i know we have a hydration station like with water and like obviously we have somewhere where we're handing these out they kind of go hand in hand so that would be fine and then like the other thing is so lynn called me and said that like it's it's really hard for the office to deal with you know we did the first shirt order and it went real fast but like you know there was in too many choices too many colors and the same thing with the koozies so lynn asks he's like we're out you can place another order but we want all the koozies to be the same color and we want them to be the same print and then we want all the shirts the same so i placed another order so the koozies will look like this but they will be in navy blue not gray because they didn't literally have um that many coopsies in the same color so it was harder than you would think it would be just to get the same i really didn't have any choices it was like here's your one choice and then the t-shirts that they liked and agreed on in the office can we do like extra ones for the jazz fights we'll see this is oh man no that's what he said he said for the jazz fest you can do a variety you can have whatever you want um and you guys can stand there and sell them so like if they bought the ones in the office that are like x oh and then also like the stickers that were wrong i went back to the meme guy benny yeah and um he traded me all of the misspelled stickers for more koozies but they were all different colors in all different prints so we actually they're saving those so we can sell them at the jazz fest and then the um another thing i was brought up was the um the men's shirts most of the men that are coming in to get a shirt are not xl they're like double xl or large so i ordered bigger sizes this order and um as we continue to get feedback from them we'll adjust our order for the but we can sell whatever we want but we have to man the table and and speaking of that like the other thing i kind of sent was if we could maybe do like beach towels and then get our logo embroidered on the bottom like right here and what i did was i i ordered these from amazon it's a three pack they're like eight bucks i'll pass around it's not a terrible quality um as i think it'll fluff up once you wash it but like obviously you can buy a four dollar beach towel and you could buy a hundred dollar beach towel like if we get this embroidered on that towel will cost us 13.35 oh good we can charge 50 bucks for that so we can charge like 20 and there's our fundraiser no i'm just kidding yeah we'll make a ton of money this is pretty solid yeah it's pretty solid i mean i i didn't mind that one so what i asked the embroidery company that i called on the first try just so happens to be the one that the city works with and he's already got this set up so we don't have to pay for that it's just a five dollar third yeah the shirts and the hats it's just a 5.35 charge you know to do the embroidery in these colors and those stitches or whatever um so we can be as creative as we want i want to start early so we have time and we know what we're going to order and um but we got to keep it manageable for you know us at the i think the towns will be ahead i think maybe about the chairs [Music] yeah so i think if we just do the beach towels and we have the koozies and the t-shirts or tank tops or whatever and then we're giving away the cups i think that's plenty i don't know giving away the quizzes um you know what on that company we can get those for like 44 so that's not a bad idea it would save us some cash but the guy down the street charges us i think 50 250 but we can order them from the company that did that little cup for 44 cents a piece [Music] how much can those really be how much were the stickers from they were expensive it's cheaper for us to just have them print our actual logo station right we're handing no we're doing water bottles on ice yeah that we're just handing out so actually that's a really good idea to do the koozies less expensive than 250 a piece because that's expensive so we'll do our one more order with him and then like we're we're working on another t-shirt guy too just because what happened to the 44 person no no that's this company so they're online they do mail but like i don't know if they can do this he has to pay a lot for these understand yeah so and it's usually two or three colors um we might be able to do that on a white koozie and that be it and that would be fine that would work because it's kind of like if they get it at the jasper so it's like you just lose it like yeah since those are the ones that we were selling right now yeah is everybody good with that george are you good with that yeah okay so white koozies with our logo and some of the bottles perfect well like every one of these are different and the price break is at a certain amount so like if the price break is you know at 100 then yeah for the first 100 people um and we can put that on the mail or if we want to because we'll know that by that if religion yeah absolutely um and so the towels are a work in progress we're just working on pricing i asked the embroidery company because he buys towels but he's like i have to up charge you for them i said you know i would like to like hold a sample of your towel in my hand and i would like to know which they are you know because otherwise we could just order those on amazon right and just have them shipped right to him and call it a day they had blue and white striped ones they came in boxes of 44 and they were less expensive but you can't return them if you don't like them and i have a feeling they're really chinsy so i didn't want to try to order that 44 box of crappy towels for a sample yeah and then i would be stuck with them if we pulled them out and we were like hey nicole i can see you you can tell okay so i didn't want to do that i want them to be a little nicer like i said they don't have to be 50 beach towels but i don't want them to be because the guy was like go to walmart by four dollar beach towels i'm like no i'm not buying cheaper beach shelves in a costume it's like a waste of embroidery in my opinion if they're crappy towels that no one can really use i would rather have a decent towel that will hold up or whatever so here we go [Music] so here's what the second order of t-shirt will look like it just says beller beach and it's got a little design so we can't he can't mess it up and i got the girls are in pink and the boys are in navy blue so i can drop off yeah so that again i just you know we did the minimum order of 30 t-shirts i did 15 and 15 and then we did the plain navy blue so we'll see how that batch goes and then we'll research the next um the next fire okay so the mailers we talked about and then i just want to see if anybody had any other thoughts for like like things that we would need to do now for the september 25th date a lot of stuff we can't do until it gets closer but i'm thinking if we had everything we're going to sell like heat up to order we have the mailers keyed up to order we have the music set i think everything else will be like a two week before unless we want to do some banners like the mailers are going to go out probably three weeks before i don't think a week gives people enough time no no so i'm going to design it and get approved and bring it to the next meeting okay yeah so we'll we'll mail those like in the beginning of september so we have a little time on those i like your idea absolutely yeah otherwise you look at it the way it's now it just says jazz press oh yeah that's because i'm not going to type all that up for you guys because you know what we're talking about so the flyer will have more details and have the time it'll say bring your picnic basket and your coolers will have giveaways they'll be like the live jazz music we'll have bellar beach gear to sell and maybe if i could get him to make one beach towel or one t-shirt you know like how up at the desk like they couldn't really do the display so they made like a a picture and they put in a stand and there was a picture of the t-shirt the picture of whatever we could put those on the flyer so they kind of see because you know really now i think the people that are buying them are the ones that are just coming in here like offhand for something but like people who had been asking me hey where'd you get that tank top i'll literally text them and go okay they they have them now for sale and then they'll come down here and buy them so i would venture to guess that 98 of the people living in bellard beach don't know that this stuff is for sale so we would put that on the flyer too we would kind of touch on everything that we're doing since one whole side of the flyer is dedicated to that event and then on the back side we would literally bullet point it like halloween pet and i don't want to say kid or child however we word that parade um with the time the date you know prizes awarded kind of thing and then we'll do the same thing for the christmas social in december on whatever day they like the christmas tree in the front we're gonna have whatever a christmas social we'll have the date the time you know secure i mean it's best practice is if you got cash coming in for me yeah or do we have cash coming in on this on the sale of the stuff we did have security on the list we've already talked about security as far as like if we i asked lynn if we needed one police officer or two he said one should be fine um you know they ask for a parking plan which we already have in place when i first brought this up to the board meeting which i i think too that's why i like if you guys can and i so appreciate everybody coming to the last one it was great um then you you hear and i know i say it but it's been months that we've talked about it like there was the people that were upset with the dunk tape event were probably on me more than anyone else about your parking plan and i don't want them on my street and so i'm not saying any security oh yeah but i'm just saying at some point we had to close down the money resources work with the police officer up to here and that's fine yeah somebody else counted the money that's no big deal yeah well whoever is manning the table will do like that at you know like if if we split it like saying two shifts whoever has a second shift we'll be responsible for that and um hopefully we sell out of the stuff before the you know and do we have a way to take credit cards or is it cash only not out there okay so i'll on the flyer we'll say bellar beach where for sale cash only so people know and then we'll have a bank put together so if someone needs change we'll have our fives and tens and whatever and then if we need to walk in with the policemen to count the money it's a big deal yeah i'm just trying to take it no no i appreciate it because i knew we had to have security i didn't think about like babysitting the money because it's not that much money but i mean if it's they will get it like any amount of money needs to be babysat that's fine i don't it's kind of depends on how much money really i did a lot of recreation stuff where we were talking about him well i'm excited i'm going to do the cash box and the merchandise nicole it's my favorite has my forte it is her forte she owns her own business she does everything wearing a belt before these oh come on we're not fair 26 change okay i've got it yeah at the carnival yeah no it'll be fun because then it's like money that i feel like we can probably make up all the money that like we'll spend on the merchandise and like the mailers and all that stuff that like we're using because i feel like once the merchandise is there in front of them they're gonna buy it and it's cash in hand so yeah it'll be good so yeah we can take care of that and if there's anything else as we get closer like a lot of the stuff just we're using like we're not gonna recreate a park it's the same parking lot so we're just going to use our parking plan um obviously we'll use whatever um it's on file here yeah so we'd fill up this lot first and then they didn't seem to be an issue if we if we use the access for the residents that on fall street um and then do you think there's gonna be enough people that we're gonna need to park on the streets i don't think so lynn said we have enough parking for 75 people if we get 75 people i'll be so happy we have enough parking in the gear for 75 people we have 53 and then in one other lot he said yeah probably the access absolutely that 12th street the 12th street he said between the two we have 75 places to park oh that's nice and you also got i don't know if you're closing down there but you got the spots there bayside so that's why the police officer will direct traffic and at the end of the evening he'll walk in the cash box yeah and he'll make sure there's no fighting yeah any issues enough garbage cans we don't need to purchase them correct yes i i wrote out here um we'll just have to what we'll do is just dedicated and if you look on the bellar beach website under the wedding planner literally it lists everything that they supply if someone will stand their wedding here and there's pictures and it's a very detailed list of what basically we have to work with as far as tables and stuff like that so um yeah i think we're pretty much set with all of that and like all of that stuff if we need to go pick up like a an extra recycle can or something that we'll know like in the two weeks leading up to it we should be able to do enough here yeah we can do that she wants like ice cream like like an ice cream truck would be really really fun yeah we could do do you want to research that since the 501 3c is off the table you can't have all these ideas because now you're not doing the five minutes the next thing the next thing is what is your that's i'm gonna vote yes on the vote parade i don't know if i'm gonna be out voted on that but i'm assuming like nipples i feel like nobody else is on board i've called three people i can't find anybody to do anything so let me just finish up the and you can go to town okay so am i researching the people because i already have someone in mind for the isis yeah yeah do you mind can you do that it would be nice to have something cold because it's gonna be hot because like even if we do a dessert truck it's like it's too hot to eat that sort of like yeah italian ice or whatever yeah it's gonna be hot yeah beautiful okay we'll have an answer and i don't think it's going to cost anything they'll probably ask you to give say i'm just throwing out a number 300 minimum so if they do not make up which i think you know whatever their number is um we have to you know right which is fair yeah so we don't call them out they can sell like three items you know on whatever number not 300 percent yeah that makes sense they have a minimum and that's that's understandable okay does anybody have anything else right now for the jazz in the park so we are having music and picnic and water and possibly an icy or something yeah and so okay and we have enough trash cans and something to help during maybe one gets overloaded to you know well okay so if you rely on that maintenance like i don't we'll have to check and see if we and that was all on my list previously like maintenance workers if we had help like setting up and tearing down the police were on there like all of that was on the original list so it's already kind of because it works okay no um well i think the basis is going to be up here yeah music's here because and then you're spread out all done all everywhere because they should be able to hear pretty far out sure and i'll have the band come here beforehand to kind of set up logistically because is there electricity in the gazebo or not the gazebo the little platform down there no i am the little platform down there where they have weddings where the gazebo the future is the only like because yeah and this is where we talked about the bananas this last time they just plugged these are all different circuits and they just run off yeah yeah that was a problem last year i remember you couldn't hear the band unless you were like honestly when i saw them i really couldn't see them but i could hear them perfectly that was the problem last year um so that would be a speaker issue i don't know what it was but i'm the guy and see like how far out we're gonna like it i'm sure it depends on how who would you put the duct tape oh nobody went in the duct tape the mayor wanted the duct tape i really don't want to touch the duct tape i'm not suggesting it oh i just heard it about four times i don't know i have no clue i just heard there was one there was one yes i don't know how it i think it did pretty fair um yeah so it did pretty good was it a [Music] there was a park being issued during the dunk tank no i didn't say that i did not i never i heard a dog tank earlier am i crazy i think i heard dogs say without you know it was just mentioned it was mentioned i know i was just curious yeah no oh you were here i never even heard of any of this like i must have been into no i must have been in indiana because i never saw an invite i never i never heard anybody talk about it i didn't talk to anybody that went i didn't know about it until about eight months ago i literally never heard it was the thing like i've never seen a person so you know but that's a good point george because we need to make sure that people can hear no matter where they sit like if they want to sit down by the water we need to make sure they can hear the music yeah if they sit on the other side of the building or the tennis courts i'm not going to worry about it but like in this general vicinity yeah yeah man that's what whatever the band has what they can do they can sit in their kayaks and listen sure thing um yeah and honestly we have a little time so if like we come up with other ideas that doesn't have to be planned out you know three months in advance you know it's kind of a working motion until about a month out this i mean you know the basics of the event that we have to get approved um and lynn said you know our budget's been approved we're allowed to have events like it's not a thing where we go oh okay our jazz fest is september 25th at five o'clock it's not the way he explained it to me is it's not a thing where they're gonna vote on it and say no you can't have it we don't want it this is our budget that is specifically for jazz or the entire entire year and what is that again six hours so what like it was like nothing so far what well all you spent was just the merchandise right and then they've sold so we should have the money back plus some like that's how i look at it right it's we spent it but we sold it and got more back right which is good but you you're still it still doesn't replenish it this year yeah i mean oh see if it doesn't replenish it then i don't i mean i didn't i thought it replenished it like why would we spend it and not get it back if you're getting that back plus more well the city manager says it's fine just the way the budgeting works it's you have to set them out well then she does the t-shirts not come out of our budget then because like we're selling it you're paying for it out of whatever you're paying for it out of like when i'm not you know i mean yeah and then you're getting the money back the money goes right back in the general fund well does the money come out of the general fund yes it's just gotta it's earmarked for but he said it's that's not the general fund if it doesn't go back into that fund goes into the general fund it goes back but it's not being pulled out of there yeah until it's reallocated it's just the way that budgeting i know no i know but i don't you're not planning on spending six thousand dollars this year right well this is yeah well no this was my question so because our budget ends september 30th and we have an event in october can we buy the gifts for that event in september so we're using like this year's budget for an october event because we don't know what our budget's going to be for next year i mean if it's an ongoing thing you'd want to spend your money that you were good you were going to use for your upcoming events yeah so we can like prepare for the october event in september we would we would do that anyway for your 350. so like and then we just placed another 350 order so that's a thousand dollars that i i just thought like we spent it and then you're making the money back and you're making more money back i didn't realize we were right it's getting it and then it's gone it's a noted point but it just doesn't go right back into that pot the way it works is we spend it and then it goes back as our general income and again you can note that you made up that money but each year they budget a set amount if approved you could spend over your budget with knowing that you got money back okay you know it's just kind of like yeah that's why i would have imagined this yeah i guess it was just never discussed so like i should have assumed that that's how i was like oh we're spending it but we're making more so we're still like ahead okay all right um so that is that for now and then um i'll go through sir speedy and have approved for our next meeting next month and hopefully we'll have some info on the italian ice and i'll have some more pricing on the towels and i'll look and see if we can find a less expensive koozie for our giveaways so those are the things i'll follow up on and then i guess we can start thinking about for our next meeting what kind of prizes we want to give away for the halloween parade obviously like you know if it's a dog then the dog's mommy or daddy will get the prize if it's a kid it would be a kid prize i'm thinking you know it would be a dog prize or a kid price depending on what is that look like it's a children dress up and a dog stress out and then there's two different yeah we've got to get the little trail together it won't be far um i've only been to one it was a great success but it was like mostly dogs and dog owners and the dogs were dressed up but like when i presented as a council they're like what about the kids and i'm like well most of the kids are probably gonna have a dog so it's gonna be it's gonna be judged separately so like say if there's 15 kids in it then there would be price for the kids like first second third whatever and then if there's say 30 dogs in it then it would be first second third for the dog so like say if someone came up with a great price for the kid or like custom for their kid and a great costume for their dog they might win both but that's kind of how i in combination they're related to each other to do costumes huh like if the kid were like well like you could be like dorothy and toto yeah like they could do whatever they wanted to but the prizes like she mentioned would be different like it'd be first second third prize for the dogs and first second third for the kids because they would be different kind of prizes at least that's what i was thinking i hear what you're saying like so one overall like combo but there's not enough kids and dog matchings in bellar beach to make that a thing that's very true that was trunk or treat for the kids yeah but they did have like a costume yeah it had a deal and they had they had i think about four or five judges and the kids had numbers and um they didn't it was all included there was no age groups i think it was all just numbered how many kids did you have do you remember high 20s i think okay so yeah i think you give like like if you come up and you have a dog then your dog would get a number and then you know your dog and your kid would get a number yeah you just uh it's kind of a cluster you just gotta try and organize it the best you can spark cats and that's fine so it's kind of like that and then you just go on a little route and then everybody comes back um the judges will award the prizes and they'll be like you know some kind of refreshments we'll do cookies and like halloween cookies and cider or whatever we put that's not a big deal it's a great honor there were a bunch of kids and then like maybe they do a little walk you know down the gulf boulevard they don't cross the street and won't cross the street anywhere you're gonna have to go all the way down to golf well that well we can decide on the route like how big it's gonna be like the one that i did like the cutest part was like they just kind of walked the sidewalks and like everybody's sitting there watching them it's like parade like oh yeah so you probably just keep it localized yeah and that people set up we can keep it local that's fine or even maybe like they can cut through go down 12th street cut around and come back unless like people are scared to have them anywhere near like people are walking their dogs up and down that way every day all the time so i don't know why it would be a thing but um the route like it could be whatever we want it to be if we want to just walk around the building but then no one sees the parade and that's fine yes but the people that wanted to see it would come right yeah so it would be kind of like the same thing that we're doing in september like people would just they don't have a dog and they only have a child their you know their kid can be in the parade too i'm concerned about a bunch of dogs oh see i never i'm more concerned about um you have to walk down between houses i feel like right or no because there's no sidewalks i mean i would my preference would be gulf boulevard because there's no sidewalks on any of the side streets so and i wouldn't cross like you're in crosstalk if if it was me i literally would like have them go um like around the building anybody that's here and then maybe down this because they're going to see tons of people let's just stay on the sidewalk right walking right to golf take a left walk around turn down ninth street and come right back around the block yeah so they're gonna that would be a lot they're gonna see it that's long enough so they will walk by houses on 12th street um but there's no thoroughfare there right what do they say they're they always complain because it's smaller but that you would cut right back through this bath yeah you would just bend around the road yeah it would yeah i mean because some of these kids are gonna be tiny they're gonna be small kids yeah and they're all gonna be with their parents yeah like every everybody's gonna have an adult supervising them in this parade like whether it be a dog and honestly george i'm thinking if you have a dog that hates other dogs like you would know that my dog's going to fight with every other dog there we're not going to enter the costume i would hope that people would have that kind of common sense like i think so i think people are going to bring that their dog is going to be a pretty socialized dog yes in their cute little costumes and yeah most dogs that wear a costume they're pretty good the poor doors oh no they look so cute stanley has a hot dog costume she hates it for sure but she won't be wearing it for the parade she's gonna your dogs are gonna be funny oh well one can't come but the little one can come see like we have a big one that's like the boss so she'll stay home and then like the little one that like doesn't act up will come because like no one wants to be manning like this well in a china shop she is a bull in a china shop too and we can put a little note on there like you know please if your dog is aggressive but i mean i don't think we need to i just think that people will know my daughter likes dog owners know if their dog's got a problem yeah so that's what i'm saying so anyway go away out yeah i don't know it's just hot at the end of october it wasn't too bad it was warm but like five or seven kind of deal yeah so people could still go to dinner afterwards or whatever if they wanted and so that's all saturday too that's we had dates big for all this um it might have been saturday i have to look back at them you know saturday october well halloween is the 31st so i mean we could do the 30th that's probably what we picked to be honest saturday you might want to just remind everyone to have them on a leash though oh they have to be on a leash yeah for sure yeah yeah i don't have anything in here yeah yeah on the flyer that would be a good reminder because people sometimes just absolutely so that's like when i do the proof i'm just going to do some generalizations and then we're going to tweak and get every single thing that we all want added onto that little flyer so we don't miss any of that we're going to do it collectively together i'm just going to throw together so they can put a proof with the size of the general and then we can make sure we get all that info on there yeah you'd think that would be common sense but you're right we see it every day yeah you're right you're right um okay and then um boat parade we need to talk about that because like i've called three captains and they're all like no i have no clue so like i was kind of like eating with this one because i don't know my husband if we have one my husband doesn't want to do it so i'm like i am more than willing to help or do anything um but i just can't find anybody that's willing to set the route have the meetings do the paperwork take on the liability so i don't know if you well i mean okay so i'll see if i can get a copy of the indian rocks beach paperwork because the captain has a meeting with all the captains and same thing with clearwater beach it's like if you're in this boat parade and it's associated with the city and say there's some kind of accident or whatever it's like they have to sign a wreath they have to sign a waiver like so there's no liability on the captain or the city like there's got to be paperwork um because if our yoga instructor has to do it i can guarantee the oh yeah they have to sign the waiver i've seen them the lawyer will look over there the waiver so we have to find someone that's willing to take like like it would be like any of these events that we're having they have to have liability insurance like they have to sign the waiver like this is a no fee thing so they don't have to pay the city but like you know we're doing the prizes i don't know like i just that whole setup thing is like out of my comfort zone so like if you i know you want to do it but like i'm just more than happy walking down the street to my friend's house picking rocks beach and watching it from their backyard because it's such they're so established and i know like so lots of empowered treasure island reddington has a madeira has a donated hazard clearwater has it or a civics or island of states they all do their own so i called them indian rock speech to see what theirs was i thought that they would just do the same thing as last year you know the first saturday or second saturday whatever it is but he said that's not true um they kind of wait to see what ready which i think has already set theirs i scribbled down it's kind of going in circles but i think what we have to keep our eye on is not to fight with them because until so like that's the first step then we can worry about the date because it's like if we find a captain we have to find a captain who's available on the date we want him jeremy okay but are we paying the captain yes he absolutely feels so much are we paying the captain we have to once we find one we say how much do you charge like i found a cabin to give my husband vote lessons it was a hundred dollars an hour and then so i my guess was a thousand dollars between the the prep time and the fact that he has to pay for some kind of insurance why is it on his shoulders and why is it not on our free city liability like any rock speech doesn't mean you're not speaking doesn't have your whole entire vote for you lying on the first half well the same reason like the yoga instructor has to pay for it yeah contract employee in the city requires contract employees to carry their ownerships it's everything we've done where it falls under the same yeah so he'd be a contractual employee for the city and it's standard policy that the contractor carries their own liability insurance insurance everybody who's done any event with ipad make sure they come in here with their insurance okay so if he were to do it for free he'd say this person is doing it for three and the city will not i guess if you find somebody we'll figure out the inner workings of how to do it if it's a volunteer the only way to possibly do it the city does an officially responsible phone opens i i just can't see us getting stoked up i don't know what i'll do whatever you guys want i don't think i'll ever find anybody who's going to get their own insurance and do it do what i mean that's unless we're paying for their no you shouldn't you wouldn't have to get the insurance if it's not a city sponsored event just have a private group of five or ten photos then we have to pay for the printing we have to like it goes back to our original problem with everything is like we have no way to get the communication out so like say we do on the postcard it won't be we're having a boat parade on december 19th it would be like hey who wants to join this boat parade and like try to organize it because we can't do like separate mailers like you know where's our signage what's that we don't have a sign out front right we're still working on that but we'll have that little roll away emergency thing can't we just roll that out like december six vote parade indian rock speech when you will go over where's that fifth wall on the bridge whatever you're gonna call it they own that little beach access we would have a prime spot right there but those are better properties so we can't do that however we could put a banner and it's not ideal but there's that little i don't know in the park it's all in the corner of the causeway golf boulevard on the north east side um right there yeah crossfit you can put banner up there [Music] yeah i'm not i'm not going down you know so yeah so you would hire you would hire a cabinet i would like to hire a captain but i would not like to hire a captain that has to have the way of for just finding insurance for anybody is that that hard it's not that expensive either why can't the city afflict that why don't the contractor build it into a speed just the city why is the city going to get them insurance i can't who you're paying acquire their own insurance because he's really this isn't a job this isn't really a job that you can kind of go out and find somebody to do this this is a big fat favor do you know what i'm saying i know but we're paying like that's the whole point we're paying him but it's okay i parked my trailer in the parking lot here and i had to pay to be here and i had my own insurance so like i'm saying everyone that like uses anything like student property like has that i'm sure like even i had to have insurance like it's just a good thing because in the liability if god forbid something happens okay i should take my last attempt to see how much this insurance would be with an unaccounted worth of votes that i have to build into this the insurance is gonna be like what am i insuring and i'm gonna be like i'll see what happens yeah did you have did you get any um like with the cities you talked to did you get names of the captains that they have i mean that's where we need to start other stuff first i yeah to start with is bellarmine junior going to allow this because this is off the table if they're not willing to spend any money on it it needs to be coming from that six thousand dollars that little nugget pulled from there and just like the shirts if it could be reimbursed if i can find sponsors for it you know all those sponsors in the back of dollar living magazine all those people are still wanting to target our people too we don't have businesses to hit up so we have to go with the plastic surgeons the real estate agents all the the community you know all the businesses that are over there and ask them and hope that they sponsor it and i don't even we don't even have banners or anything to really sponsor anything it's hard um and i hear that if it's i just don't think you'd ever find anyone limit you know i read at that like a cut-off point oh my gosh like i don't think we're gonna have like a cut-off limit uh problem i don't think we're gonna have 100 votes trying to come in hey we're not responsible for all of this and you have to sign that as you sign up for it right but if that's a non-starter like that's not something that the city will do which just release their liability and they're forcing you to have insurance for the accident that that seems like the impossible to me is that what it is the city's going to require they're going to yeah just like everybody else that we've set up anything with it's the same there there won't be an exception so especially if we're paying a [Music] to answer a lot of these other questions but until we can find someone who actually knows what they're doing right for whatever amount of money you're nowhere right like so all you know i mean like all these things that we're asking and talking about is kind of a viewpoint to be find a person that um has experience i don't want someone that just woke up and said hey i want to do a boat parade and they don't know what they're doing like i wouldn't pay someone a thousand dollars whose number has no experience so if they said hey i've done the clearwater one i've done i have experience here's my resume then we would be like yes and then that person knows they have to have something else they gotta be some of these guys gotta be pretty open to doing another one and they can't all be like i only do one and that's it i mean the cap so look i mean we got to find that person and then we can answer all of our other questions so and then the only other thing and we can close out this is um look for that person yes she can make i've called everyone i know every captain in my phone that i have met i have called so and they all said no no i don't know a single captain beach though you know all rock speech yes but they don't have to live i get so i would call any captain you know um so we talked about this before but i just wanted to revisit it as far as um we talked about doing a like whatever date first saturday of the month doing a beach cleanup with maybe like donuts afterwards one hour eight to nine or something is that something we want to visit right now or we want to table that i'm cool with it just not saturday mornings but you're not available saturday or sunday you're always working for the most part george what about you okay i just put your general thoughts on it like nothing yes maybe good idea bad idea i don't know it's cute i have a little doughnut station on the the south end of the beach i will go donut drink station on north end start at either corner and at the other side like that whatever or however you want to do it in the middle ah well we would need teams and be like okay we've got 20 people this group go to this beach access and then everyone meet it whatever the access in the middle for the middle yeah we can meet in a certain spot everybody can go out is that 12. come back i mean morgan's roughly in the middle of bel air beach area because we're we're not going to i'm assuming we're not going to clean bell or shore beach we're here street area to clearwater yeah clearwater which is right where the marina is so where the buildings start getting high and that's plenty for our first go-around because it depends on how many people we have but we can talk about that um more next time because i don't i mean i just want to throw it out there it's like hey do we want to have one more thing i think that would be great i think it's fun beneficials it is super inexpensive i will just tell you though like so for like the paddleboarding she had it on sunday mornings she got feedback that people can't do it on sunday mornings because of church and so like she just moved her events to saturday so i mean i'm the same way it's like it's very hard for me to do things on sunday morning um so we'll just revisit that but she can't do it and you can't do it george is up in the air and it would be me so that's then we can't do it right when is it once once a month the first saturday whatever first saturday second saturday i mean we would just pick it and so we would hope that it would grow we would never move it like maybe not everyone could be there but it would be like okay however many people have will clean what we can clean for an hour and call it a day it doesn't happen short and sweet but yeah and then show up but it would fall on our shoulders as well you know but we have to get enough people to make it work absolutely it'll come and grow it'll turn into a thing you might want to do it all right thank you not much facebook page with 200 and how many um i have to check to see what it is and see if we get any if we don't get any like response from that because we don't really have any other way to like post it out there without spending a lot of money and if nobody shoots anything back saying oh yeah i'm available or that sounds great or that's interesting and i i mean we could all text it to 20 people on our phone from bella beach and just see what the response is because if we got 10 people the first time i think that would be a good turnout and then it would grow by word of mouth yeah i don't think it's going to be one of those things that people are going to commit to pre-register to i think it's just going to be like oh it's the first saturday uh it's speechless but i think we should have some some kind of thing to attract them to it other than just a sign saying i'm going to do this beach cleanup on wednesday say something like okay we'll do a two-hour beach cleanup the person who brings the most kind of junk to the oregon park yeah to collect the most put it on your wrists people already do it george yeah it would be just like a way to like maybe get them to you know do it with us or you know do it together and just kind of like a little i mean i'll put i'll put down the family thing yeah to bring the kids to them to do something constructive for your community and then their kids are gonna want donuts and you honestly like if we if everybody gets there and we know we have 15 people i was in here showed up and joined the morning and it's one hour that's interesting um he's saying the hands across the beach about where i guess they had a whole bunch of people hold hands that spread across oh not covered down that's pretty crazy six foot apart that's about a while ago maybe more than six years you know took pictures from the newspapers right there's absolutely zero chance that they'll ever go for a dog on the beach like six to seven in the morning on sundays or something like that right has that ever been tossed around you know like in new york city you can let your dog been off leash in riverside park every day between five and six now listen we don't want to do that because people live there um so you that's something you come for that citizen's forum that has not come up yet been shocked i have not heard of that i've only been here coming up about three years to bring that idea to the board it's an interesting thing you want to bring it up the council meeting we'll be here for you settle in a little bit i might be sick that day i mean maybe you can try and research any other beach beauty that's tried it i loved it yeah i live in hibiscus i live yeah that's the way over there i belonged here that day anyway so i was thinking like if we wanted to throw it out and get any interest on um saturday june 5th that's the first saturday of the month um and just see if we can get maybe 10 people together i know you can't um and if we have no interest then no one will do it but it's just uh like let's throw it out there and see if anything develops and what is it officially called the bel air beach it's clear beach yeah okay i didn't understand whatever [Music] uh the floating dog what is that called not really a floating dot uh on second street did you ever look into that or whatever i i have i got a guy that's supposed to give me a price um and he hasn't he hasn't gone back i'll just send it uh i'll have paddy send it to you to you guys once i get that so that we don't have to wait yeah okay that'd be great yeah that'd be nice all this stuff takes so long i know that's what i mean that's just everything sometimes like now at this time like especially with doc people it's hard to get responsibilities everyone's busy yeah everybody they've been in their house um what would you guess to me do you have i guess i guess a couple thousand a couple minutes yeah and that's not going to do the whole color that would be to add you know a permanent step down so this is the other thing though with that that i mean i'm going to put a wrench into real quick because if you guys see the traffic over the causeway going that way with people trying to park at the beaches so like that might throw a wrench into the whole beach cleanup thing because we can't get down to morgan park like from this end of the beach like you have to drive or when it's like a three mile bike ride which i can't carry donuts and garbage bags and all the stuff we'll need on my bike so it's sometimes an hour to get down there and people are literally lined up in the median trying to find a parking place so there might not be any parking at morgan park once we get down there so that's the only thing that like because i love this idea but the parking which is usually like the traffic over the causeway is usually kind of lightened up by now with everyone going back to wherever they don't seem to be going back everyone seems to still be here because they're still working from home and the traffic over the causeway on the weekends is so crazy i think outside of you everyone's going to be just walking to their near speech access and walking from there on dollar store stand they're walking out do you know what i'm saying do you know how far burning park is yeah it's like two miles yeah you're i mean i i don't think it's two miles it's three and a half miles to um because tim runs that yeah it's three like three miles to like columbia and yeah it's probably a half a mile from no you're probably like you're from your house is over a mile for sure closer to two right there too i know it's three miles to clearwater beach welcome to clearwater reach thank you because um three miles from there are you ever minded debates went down by yourself [Music] we have to do it early so that it might not be it may be a non-issue but i just thought i'd bring it up just because the traffic is eight in the morning it's not terrible it doesn't say if it's like it's about half from your house the more important okay i'm like why is it saying it's only six minutes so it may be a non-issue just because it's so early but i just wanted to throw that out there because if anybody stares in the traffic or sat in that traffic it's not fun or maybe you could do it during like the cooler months not each season because you know once it's not each season morgan's not super whatever so keep it on june 5th at 8am or meet at morgan park and we can shoot that out there and see if we get any interest is everybody okay with that and then if we do get interest um nicole can when she gets the responses can email patty and then patty can shoot it out to us they're putting it out there first as a feeler yeah is there any interesting page okay so you got 19th street access there's one house and then bella beach roughly it's not quite that far north it's 20th street i live on 20th street okay so 20th street to the marina yeah that's where it's continuous bella beach one house north of 19th street access yeah we're just gonna like we're talking about communication and it's really our best communication i'll have patty put it on the website um if you're interested in helping with the bellar beach and then if no one calls us back and no one responded responds then we know it's like a non-issue so we'll just put out feelers and see what we get can i get a list of the names just make a public records request yeah and then she'll it might be a minor cleaning the parking lots i thought we're just cleaning them yeah yeah it's technically a public and the way it is now it's it's my residence first priority so if you're not resident you don't even get considered until i mean i wouldn't mind doing it because of the contracts and everything yeah but um and we do they have to provide their insurance every year if their vote changes i mean i go down there and i check if we have enough members there's only eighteen that's just our section but there was actually a time that non-residents were running because there was no residence that when they slipped it's hard to believe now yeah like when i cross the street um hey you know what it all depends on the number of people if we have a ton of people then it would be great to do that so what i didn't realize is like um george said that like say if you park at 6th street down by us so as wide as that parking lot is all the way out to the water and that section of the beach belongs to bel air beach um but just on not bella beach that's what he just did the extras or access was i'll add the access at the exits at the abscess so the as wide as the parking lot if you go down to the water that whole that yeah down there it's really wide it goes it goes out yeah i don't know the exact distance so george was suggesting like you know we we obviously start at morgan park and we go from 20th street down to san kee where it's all beller beach but if it grows and we get enough people then we can say you know year you can go to 6th street you can go to 12th street or 9th street or whatever it is and you clean the part that's our beach so like once we get a good number of people that would be great yeah i don't know if it's actually our accidents oh yeah and they're not going to stuff we have if you're a resident then you can you can use that sure yeah so i if you can use it i'm sure you can clean it we made it yeah we our staff cleans it so i don't know i guess unless there was an issue of us cleaning the beach there but you guys can clean it anyway we our staff still goes out there cleans the trash and empties the trash and mows grass all that stuff okay so um is everybody good with item number five does anybody have anything else to add or community advice number six okay i gotta get that from everyone on george everyone ready to move on yes okay so item number six i brought this up last time i'm just bringing it like so we i have to report to the city council at the meeting once a quarter so like um if we are presenting something that needs to be voted on or you know i would love for you guys to be i'll ask patti to have it at the very beginning is close to you know before 6 30. um it's the first monday of the quarter yeah this is the holiday unless it's holiday yeah so the next one would be what is that the first monday of june that's the first monday yeah because uh june 1st is a tuesday okay well no i thought i did so there was one for jan fed march there was one for april may june so the next one would be july oh you say you do it quarterly okay i thought you were talking about the meetings oh sorry yeah so that's what she was asking i'm sorry so the next one would be in july so and that's when we would bring up the stuff that we're talking about and the you know the fire and all of that so like if you can i would love for you to be here so you would hear the support the objections the feedback because it's better for you guys to know when we're having these discussions what kind of feedback i'm getting from this group so you understand what we're um doing deal the first one um it might be july 5th but because that's right next to a holiday they might move it so like the first it probably be july 3 or something yeah whatever it is and if you can't be here you can't be here i'm just asking because it's like no one wants to go back and listen to that on audio and so it's just you know as a group i think it would be a little oh technically it might be july 6th or right because that would be it's a holiday week well it would be the city holiday technically because the no i was just asking if you could be here when i present so you hear the feedback so you know like the situation as opposed to me trying to explain what happened at the meeting and the feedback that i got but these are quarterly events yeah once a quarter i have to do a board report okay so the next one's in july so if you can be there great if you can't it's no big deal yeah i mean i would appreciate it and i and then they know who the park and record is and who's doing all this stuff is to just supposed to see my mug up there so okay perfect not a big deal but i just thought i'd ask and then number seven all other business does anybody have anything else okay and then number eight um if you guys can check your schedules for wednesday june 16th at three o'clock um now patty used to send out like an email saying do you want this date or the other day she prefers that we put it on the meeting notes and we just agree to the date before we leave yeah and then if something comes up in the next month then you can just you know is everybody good with the 16 okay perfect and so do i have a motion to adjourn the meeting nora drive a second"
