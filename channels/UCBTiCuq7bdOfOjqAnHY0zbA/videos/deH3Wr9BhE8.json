    "transcript": "give me the a okay i'm ready okay thank you everyone calling to order the virtual meeting of the city of bel air beach july 20th it was scheduled for 6 p.m it's now 6 38 p.m due to technical difficulties dave thank you for fixing it up for us patty thanks for getting it up and um we're now in uh under session let's uh rise for the pledge of allegiance please i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states madam clerk will you please call the roll council member robin hockey here council member mark here council member dave gattis council member jody shirley here council member rita swope here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo here and city manager lynn reeves here okay thank you so we have one item on this agenda it was put on by the city manager discussion and review of the fy 2020 2021 budget with that i'll turn it over to lynn reeves yes mayor and console this uh is just a recap we we went through this last week and really at this point in time what i'm looking for is any additional comments that you want to make or adjustments to the budget so anyone that has any comments uh please please bring them forward lynn that's mark um the things i'd like to add to the budget if we if we can is um the hvac vent wall that i talked about in the past what this will do is allow that air conditioning systems that the city will run cooler and it'll save a lot of money on energy and hopefully they won't be running as hot and that'll prevent a burnout that we had on one system about four years ago and with that i'd like to also mention the security system around the building we've talked about it i know there's money that's sitting in the side but i'd like to move forward with that and the other item is um putting a gate up at the south end of the park by the by the city hall and that mainly would uh then we'd be able to lock that park up at sunset and give the people on ninth a little peace of mind at night and prevent people from going in there at night i think it'd be a safety issue since we talked about not putting any cameras on the park i think it'd be a good idea so those are the three items that i that i like to move forward on well i can tell you that the uh louvers uh cost estimate that we got through train was 23 dollars as a round number uh the security cameras there's already twenty thousand in there and uh the gate on the at the park we we do have a chain gate across there that we could implement that right now if we ask just put it as an additional duty as opposed to putting uh you know spending uh an amount of money to put a fence type gate up there and we utilized that uh when the parks were closed during the uh shutdown when everything was closed so i don't know what the console's pleasure on that is on the hvac the security i think is taken care of and we've discussed that and the gate we do have as i said a chain across there so what what is the console's pleasure on that leonard we're just talking about louvers into a uh block wall is that what we're yes you allow some ventilation yes the the the corral where all the uh air conditioning equipment is outside is open air and uh ins what the quote was from trane was installation of four four by six fixed louvers uh and you know this is something that's been discussed uh i can't tell you you know my experience marv would know more about it than me uh i don't know if it's good bad or indifferent jody want me to explain it to you here's here's what it is those um units are sitting like in a bowl that's the simplest explanation and none of those units have what they call the velocity stack on them so what's happening the hot air the velocity stack on those fans is like a let's say the fan is round and it's a round tube that would go up to the top of those walls what that then would do is allow the cold air to be drawn in and the hot air to be drawn out or pushed out over the top of the wall what's happening now is the hot air is recirculating those fans aren't strong enough to push that hot air all the way up over those walls so what's happening the the condensers are overheating and the only way you can run those those units is under charge them the other bad thing is you overheat your condensers and run the compressors longer and they get hot so this is what caused the failure about four years ago so by putting the louvers in the wall what you're gonna do is draw air into the bottom and that'll allow for more circulation cody right so the um that sounds like about a five thousand dollar fix i think maybe we're calling the wrong people i'm not i mean i don't know i don't you know maybe it's the cutting the concrete out i'm not sure why the louvers are very very inexpensive but they may have to put you know reinforce it if it's down i'm just saying it just seems that seems very expensive 23 000 i think it can be done a lot less expensive yeah what what the issue is with this this came from train uh that's who takes what our air conditioning system and heating is and yes there's there's some issues with the structural portion of the walls so something would have to be done with that and i'm sure that's why uh the cost is is what it is and and this is just one one cost it may cost eighteen thousand i'm just saying we got we got a price to look at that and uh to see what the i guess i'll call it the worst case scenario is and i can't tell you that over the life of five years from now if we'll get five thousand dollars a year back in you know energy savings or not uh because that's i'm not an expert on that yeah the only the only thing that you're going to save is a you know as we had we had one failure whether that was another scenario tied into the failure but working with units like these for years it's just a bad way of of doing things that should have been put in the original design in the building but something that was overlooked at the time but if you see air conditioning systems on the top of the roof or you see them in around any building or cooling towers if you're familiar with cooling towers they're all ventilated and that's the primary reason is what i explained it's let that air come in the bottom easily and air go out the top you need to draw in cool as cool air as possible and uh being if the vents are put on the east side of the building fine in the morning the mornings are normally cooler in the evenings and as the sun travels west you'll be drawing in cool air from the east side cody and i recommend that we just put an extra couple of thousand dollars in there and i think i know we have a savings account for hvac and my and i would say it sounds like may you know we've maybe identified a problem but i don't think it's up to us to decide how that should be fixed you need a mechanical engineer to look at it and so maybe use put some money aside to get a mechanical engineer to tell us what needs to be done or call the mechanical engineer that did the original design and tell him his design is bad and tell him to fix it that's what i would agree it sounds like a design so i mean i think that you know it's great that we have uh we've identified it but we need to know for sure for certain the fix and that's up to an engineer to tell us okay any other comments i'm a stationary engineer or was 20 years ago but since retired but i i didn't design them but i installed them so i know how the installation goes yeah the missing piece of the puzzle is what's the cost benefit of this improvement i mean yeah it's nice improvement but what's the payback on it and twenty thousand dollars i mean what's what's the payback the cost well if it's if it saves if it saves one of the units from being replaced your cost savings is extended out let's put it that way by not replacing a unit or multiple units in the next few years hopefully it'll extend the life and hopefully the damage that was done to one that failed for various reasons who knows maybe this will extend the life of them that's all i can tell you what's the expected lifespan on the unit in a perfect world with proper ventilation proper ventilation i've seen them again my most experienced but failing units is in the midwest and they can run as far as 20 years 30 years in florida i know life expectancy on a home unit is down to about 12. you know i haven't had any experience with industrial units in florida so i like italia's experience i've had with cooling towers and ventilation and installing how old are they now it would be 10 years 10 years old so if they're only supposed to last two more years maybe maybe five you got to look at it that too because would it be better just to hold off and put the money into a new unit once it's needed i don't know i'm just asking and that that's what we've got the savings accounts that we do uh for in the capital projects fund we we save that money to alleviate the uh you know large dollar expense in it in a single year so we're building up uh an amount of money up to replace those i you know what lynn to put this thing to bed and go on with the rest of it is just call an engineer up get an opinion and let that be the guidelines and go forward okay okay we can do that lynn i'd like to um you and i've had some discussion on this but everyone else obviously has not um with us so um this whole issue with the beach easements and access points and enforcement the basic idea is that the police pretty much you know are doing what they can i guess at this point with the with the individual that we have patrolling both cities that's obviously not adequate and i know lynn you've been out there looking and things have been temporarily better but they get temporarily better they get temporarily worse it's been going on ever since i've been here and i think it's been going on before that so the question is is what are we going to put aside for as a contingency to address this issue um i realized that tomorrow um you know you're going to be going over to bellaire shore discussing this some more but you know i i think something has to be done other than just us saying you know yeah we're going to deal with it or you know we're going to ask the police to step it up because i think the police have stepped up as much as they can so if this means that we have to put some temporary security on then that was that's what it means if it means we have to hire an officer so be it and then there's bigger things like gates and card control and stuff like that but i don't think we can continue to ignore it it's obviously creating a rift between the two cities um and it's going to end badly no matter how we do it if we don't address it so that's my point how much you want to put at it and what you propose i don't know but i don't know that there's anything in on that no there is there isn't anything in there at this point uh i don't think we you know from a fiscal standpoint we want to pay for a deputy for 48 dollars an hour uh to to basically check id cards uh if that's what you're wanting to do and and i think that has to be discussed further with belair shore in also uh so you know we could uh set some money in this budget or we could once everything's resolved we could amend it at a point in time that we feel comfortable in both cities or uh agree that this is the the process that we go forward with so any other feedback on that and i'm not proposing that we use police officers i mean but obviously even if you had a security you know part-time security there and it's you know again we've talked about this as weekends and holidays but um you still need police ultimately to respond because security can't you know they can't they have no law enforcement power so um we need something and again i just don't think you know i think we're ignoring this at our own peril and and there's just several things that play over here um you know i don't even think we get to this umbrella ban if if we had been patrolling those things a little bit better and it is our responsibility under this in a local we are the ones who took on the responsibility of security so i don't want to say we're in breach of the contract i won't go so far but i mean we could do better i just will say that and um let's you know i just want to make sure that we there i mean i don't care if we amend it after you speak with them tomorrow night if we have more discussions but if it's not resolved by september i just we're going to need money and it should be resolved by september because we've been talking about it since may so right i i would i would suggest that uh if uh after the the further discussion uh with bellar shore if if we need to add some money to the budget then i think i would just do that at the you know let everyone know from the budget workshop and we'll go out and kind of figure out okay do we want someone there on and and that's really up to the city council is the city council saying they want some that one there on every weekend saturday and sunday are they wanting you know sporadic are you wanting it year-round that's a question that we need to resolve also i think you need an overarching strategy on this and one of the one of the biggest issues right now that you can really put your finger on and that you see is cost containment of the legal fees that are that this thing's starting to generate right and and and it also goes to that contract review you handed out that thing with a contract review and you went down the line there and there were several line items in there that said hey we need to review these contracts and there's one that's ready for an rfp but you know you threw it out there nobody reacted and we don't have a next step or we haven't identified what the action item is out of that one of those things was legal right go ahead i'm sorry i meant yeah this is council member slope i'm gonna agree on the legal i mean our attorney fees are is just getting absolutely incredibly high i mean we were at 6500 for the month of june and and we all know july is going to even be more with you know seven and a half hour meetings and stuff as well as our videographer that's there for those that amount of time so what do we have in the budget for legal and for the video of videographer the the video person we have eight thousand dollars uh because we didn't have a couple uh meetings you know that that there's some savings there but as far as the city attorney through june we've expanded the budget that we set up which was 35 000 and mainly that that a lot of that money unfortunately you know it was between public records and this that and the other back and forth there was a little bit of additional expense with the charter review back and forth to get those things done so if this continues if the trend continues we're going to have to even add more money to this budget jody i guess no one's monitoring to raise your hand no i did i said jody didn't you hear me oh i know i raised my hand but i don't know if any anyone else oh i'm seeing it yeah electronic raise your hand um so i i we've kind of jumped into another subject but back to the beach um in bel air shores i know when we talked about lynn when you and i talked about the um gulf boulevard beautification it seems like that that would be a time we're gonna have to amend the budget to tackle that which would then of course because that does tie with belair shores would be a good time to allot any funds that might need to be allotted for whatever the resolution is with bellar shores i don't want to go into a whole lot of discussion about that but whatever it is so so that would be my comment um with regards to allowing some funds for um something there and then then back to the legal fees i agree we need to i have to tell you i looked in detail at that last invoice we received i'm not sure how my name got on there because i am so i never reach out to our attorney i think i sent lynn and patty an email about beach cleanup and somehow the attorney reviewed the email i don't know why the attorney would need to review my email about having beach cleanup i i don't i don't even know why he's seeing that that was a question to lynn should have never gone to the attorney there are a lot of conversations between council members and the attorney i just don't i my personal opinion is we shouldn't be reaching out to the attorney unless there's a dire something and i think that those communications should go through lin to control costs just my thought and i'll leave it at that when yeah two things one is and it goes to the sheriff's line item in this thing we've got a worksheet that was provided for fiscal year 21. and i discussed it a little bit with lynn reeves and it kind of goes to what changes are there i'm not sure we understand everything i asked lynn reese if he might reach out to some of the other municipalities and maybe benchmark some of these costs and try to understand whether or not there are some differences and why there might be some differences along the lines of these uh the cost containment for legal fees one one of the aspects of this thing is i i think there are ex parte conversations going on with the city attorney that need to stop discussions and strategy needs to be discussed in a council setting before the city attorney gets tasked with any kind of actionable item that the problem with that is if the strategy changes we're doing a a a renewed work effort and that's bringing up additional legal costs and also strategies are being set and then without discussion without the advice and consent of the entire council so my proposal here is that any and all discussions with the city attorney are either in the council chambers with all council members present or they are filtered through the city city manager and he kind of takes a lead on it that's number one that's a professional courtesy to have the city manager in the loop on this thing and also the precedents we we had a council member get spanked for this very thing of uh having an ex parte conversation with the city attorney and coming up with a resolution or whatever and that's not the way business is supposed to be done you have a meeting with the council you come up with a strategy you task the city attorney everybody is in the loop so glenn yeah come on if i add something uh to that last comment uh i know that you're referring to my resolution however my resolution was handed over to patty uh and lynn and then they decided to bring the attorney in because they were not aware of how to handle this particular situation so i don't want you to think or go under the false pretense that uh that that's what happened that i was undermining uh the council i actually went to patty and lynn and never once said i need the attorney to do something uh so uh just to clear the record no i i didn't bring that up in the pejorative sense uh and you know i that the issue was there was some business conducted without the full knowledge of accounts and there are discussions now and i will be specific now either there are conversations between the mayor and the city attorney that are taking place resolutions are being developed and then they're being slapped in front of the council without discussion and a full exploration of all the different alternatives and options and i think that needs to stop that's one of the ways we start containing the cost for the city attorney well let me speak to that when the contract for the city attorney was executed if you bother to read it you'll find that i have absolutely every right to speak directly to the city attorney i don't have to go through the city manager or anyone else um as mayor sometimes i'm privy to stuff that other people aren't it's just the way it goes and sometimes you're privy to things that i'm not privy to so i have a reason sometimes for speaking with him in terms of setting policy i've set no policy with him sometimes i discuss stuff with him being an attorney i'm able to discuss an attorney to attorney which is benefit that no one else has and he enjoys those conversations i noticed that he doesn't always bill for the full amount of those conversations and i do think they're productive i'm not wasting his time um i don't go to him for routine matters i only go to him when there's something that affects the city or something that really has to be kept confidential it's not always practical or actually advisable for me to include anyone else and i'm not going to go through anyone else i had an issue that concerned lynn reeves directly and i'm not going to even say what it was i definitely didn't want to go through him given the situation and thankfully it was resolved in the positive and it was resolved by the city attorney and never came before this council it's not something that had to come before this council at least in the city attorney's opinion so sometimes that stuff comes up there's not routine um conversations that are going on um in terms of his dollars that are being spent we could spend it better okay if you're going to sit a city at hernia for seven hours on a council meeting that's our fault okay he didn't have to be here he wasn't giving advice during all that time you're gonna sit a city attorney in and discuss a 200 bill by people that was submitted and spend 150 of his time while he doesn't give a concrete yes or no decision you're going to spend legal time one of the i like the city attorney but one of the problems i'm seeing is that we can't get a straight answer okay it happened just the last conversation i got your next dave um and uh i think dave gattis asked three times to have something um explained by the city attorney that i had brought up a legal issue and he didn't i don't know if he still got his right answer um we're spending money for all of that stuff and we see that back and forth constantly um sometimes you can't just sit on the fence sometimes you got to make a decision and i see a lot of this sitting on the fence waste a lot of legal fees okay and so i i think stuff can be cut down um also keep in mind this year we had charter review which we had him sitting in on which was a you know he was in on several different events for that it took like how many times to to get the charter review stuff i still don't think we have it complete i mean some of this stuff to me is just not good workmanship you know and i'll go out in the the lead and say that um that charter review stuff should have been drafted once and if if it was drafted multiple times that's not our fault okay that we didn't change our minds so i do think we could do better as for the public records request shame on the person who made that thing that wasted thousands and thousands of dollars of city money unnecessarily and uh so be it you know it is what it is if people are gonna do that you're gonna spend legal money so i think we can do a better job of cost containment i don't know that it's going to get down as low as probably everybody wants it to be dave oh if uh memory serves me correctly i believe whenever we went through the interview process of the three attorneys and attorney firms that applied uh to uh to become our our city attorney uh it seems to me that um fred's was was the most uh inexpensive but it was purely an hourly rate and i think that up front we were possibly going to pay more for other probably higher uh more highly qualified uh attorneys and firms uh up front but now i'm beginning to wonder if we're really getting uh the best bang for buck uh doing this this hourly rate whereas uh someone who's a little uh better versed with our type of community and uh uh especially a beach community would would have an answer much quicker and it would be far more precise again i i have no no uh grievances with fred reilly but it's at some time we're going to be paying a premium budget for an attorney that we could have already had for much cheaper does that make sense uh robin and then glenn no dave what you're saying makes sense but you know when i look back on the other attorneys you know they brought their big gun that you know guys that had their name on the law firm but they were going to give us like the junior partner who didn't have any experience so you might have been paying more money for less experience at least he had cheaper rates and he has experience with another city which is you know why he got my vote because i thought he was the cheapest and the most experienced as opposed to a new attorney that's getting their feet wet and i don't want to be the city that they get their feet wet on so i mean i don't know i don't know if he's supposed to give a straightforward answer i think that last meeting the potential leak future legal issues to me i would think as an attorney you don't want to concretely say something because then you may get stuck in that role if something comes up down the road so maybe he was trying to be vague for that i don't know again i'm not an attorney but so far i think that a lot of the money was spent on that records request so hopefully that's in the past and we won't have to have any more of those big records requests and then we can move forward and hopefully we will not have another seven hour meeting that's it glenn uh number one the uh lynn provided his review of the contract and city attorney is on that for review and it's one of those things where i think everybody is has some questions in the back of their their mind to address uh robin's uh issue with expertise that the the benefit of of some of these larger law firms is that yeah they may send a guy with the least amount of experience but when there's a question or an issue that he's not that familiar with he goes back to the office and he has a a ready resource and he can talk to his uh his fellow uh attorneys in the in the office fred i don't think has that depth uh of expertise that he can lean on uh i think and that's starting to surface maybe in this beach issue uh i think we're starting to rack up them some some attorney fees in this as he as he uh obviously educates himself on the issues and that sort of thing but at some point i i think there's going to be some questions that we may want to just go straight to an expert on somebody who's familiar with these issues has a lot of background and in the long run it saves money may seem expensive up front but you're going to get an answer much quicker and with a lot more reliability and level of confidence than keep uh revisiting and negotiating this thing it's a it's kind of a fundamental difference in uh philosophy here i know we want to go negotiate this thing with bel air shore and then see what needs to be done next my feeling and my experience has always been you walk into a negotiation knowing a lot of the answers to the questions that are going to be asked you don't go in and find out what the questions are and then go research them i mean it's better to walk in loading for bear and understand what the issues are and uh what what resources and what the case law is already out there so that's all i have just to add something that glenn said with i saw it with this beach stuff and again i'm not trying to knock fred he and i have spoken a little bit and it to me as an attorney 60 70 of your worth is anticipation and issues spotting and i don't know that that's happening all the time um i could give you three ish instances on the last meeting where it didn't happen i spotted him he didn't spot him i'm not your attorney and i'm not gonna give legal advice and i don't know that the legal advice is appreciated anyway so i'm not going to get it um he asked me to help him review all the laws i'm not doing it okay that's not my responsibility this council can review the laws i'm not negotiating anything with across the street although i intend to speak as a citizen i have my rights and i intend to to uh protect my rights but you know it hit home with this issue with the signage um that uh the attorney who came to us mr a um he uh lin uh lynn got the uh information sent it to me and fred said um well the man was nice he gave me a k he's gonna send me the case law and i said i'll tell you the case law i'll tell it to you right off the top of my head and i told him the case that was the overriding u.s supreme court case um you know this is not news this is not news at all this thing came out four years ago and it was a big issue so you know why we're researching that and why we're doing that i mean i wouldn't even charge for that legal research if it was my firm because i just feel something you should know and we are doing that and to glenn's point he's right okay we're doing this with this beach thing now this is a complicated issue um with who you know where the sand lies and all this stuff it's complicated but um that's why i'm encouraging us not not to get into litigation because this is an expensive venue to start researching and i don't know if he's the right person for that quite frankly so um you know i think we can better spend our money maybe we do have to bring in a specialist if we get embroiled in litigation of which i think there's two or three things pending right now um it's uh it's something that you know we're just going to have to watch but i as i recall to robin aki's point um as i remember when we reviewed these and don't hold me to it i think the big firms gave you a set amount of hours i think even paul mourinho did that with us in the past and he had a flat fee and that covered you for a certain amount of average time but if you started to exceed that you still had to pay extra so i think we'd be exceeding it under probably anyone's contract and probably pay in some overages lynn might be more familiar with the particulars of the contract but i think that's the way it worked yeah usually they give you a a base but the the typically in the in a lot of these contracts that base gives you i'll call it generalized legal advice but uh and and i could pull those rfqs out and just kind of give you some update on them because i know it's been what 12 months ago but what i recollect those firms did offer us a flat fee for basic and then if it was additional items that we had to pay for that was outside of that scope there was an additional charge but i can pull those out if the console wants me to counsel city manager lynn reeves i'm good with you pulling it out we need to get a stronger attorney that can in my opinion that can um be our attorney so we don't you know nobody on this quorum and then this city council should be given legal advice at all so we need an attorney that can do that for us as a whole for the whole city versus uh you know conference in with another attorney of any kind as far as one on the city council because i disagree with mayor manziel given talking to our city attorney as attorneys attorney because you're not representing this city as an attorney and we all know that so i think we need to get a stronger attorney i'm not counseling with him as the city's attorney i'm counseling with him as mayor and it's within the contract parameters i wrote the contract and you all approved it so and i shouldn't have had to write it by the way but don't worry folks i'm not going to be doing too much legal for you um you know it's again it's i'm not the city's attorney so i kind of expect him to step up an issue spot and do what he's supposed to do but i don't check my attorney license at the door and i do have a responsibility to this city um the city not to each of you not to any of you but to the city to make sure that the city doesn't get itself embroiled in lawsuits so if i see something wrong i'm going to say it because i would not be acting as an attorney if i didn't um i'm not your attorney i'm obviously an expert in the law and so if i see something that's wrong i'm going to say it and um but he's not going to be working with me on anything it's that simple yes jody yeah mayor i you know and i appreciate your um candidness of you know having the ability and the knowledge but we don't want to put you in the shoes that you have to we have to rely on you we have a city attorney for that right so it's not fair to you and it puts you at some i mean it puts you in kind of a liability situation which isn't right either i mean i wouldn't want to be in your shoes so i'm just saying i know and all due respect to you i think no thank you to rita's point i think it makes sense that we make sure that there's someone stronger that hopefully doesn't have to call you for advice i i didn't that's kind of not a good position to be in so and and i shouldn't have to really you know and i've done this in the past and i'm just not going to be doing it much i i shouldn't be you know i i took him to task glenn gunn wrote this i'll say it because i did discuss this with fred he wrote a proposal for um for some um control on uh records requests and i asked during our work session i said what's the legal authority i asked lynn to get me a memo on the legal authority well i haven't gotten it and i'm not going to get it because i know why i'm not going to get it because there is no legal authority for it and i had that discussion with him afterwards and basically that the feeling was is that well you know i kind of put it through to get to a discussion i'm like fred this is my opinion but don't put something through that doesn't have legal basis because then you put me in the position of saying wait a minute you can't do this okay that thing was against the u.s constitution the state constitution and the state statute don't get me even going i said don't you dare bring that up to the council because if you bring it in the condition that it's in i have no choice but to shoot it down i'd look like an idiot if i don't but toby thank you for your concern i shouldn't have to be the one doing that because you know what there's other mayors who are you know from all walks of life one's an ex-cop one's a hairdresser one's a business person what if i was an accountant from the good old days i shouldn't have to be doing this and i really don't want to do it so i'm not the city's attorney and i'm going to step away more and more from even giving legal advice but i've never been the attorney to counsel him with smokes point um and i never will be okay so just so you know thank you jody though for your concern dave uh yes i would uh i would uh like to ask the council to uh let's just go ahead and do a yearly review on our attorney and decide if this is the direction we want to go continue go uh moving or do we want to uh begin interviews again for a replacement personally i would prefer to have an attorney that is not basically his opinion is not left open for interpretation i would like clear and concise answers i would also like to have an attorney that cannot be pushed around uh by the council i think that basically we should respect that attorney and um listen to what he has to say and we don't second guess him uh it's you know obviously people are going to have different differencing opinions but i believe it happens too often with fred and um i i think especially uh with what's happened uh in recent meetings i think that it would be in the city's best interest to move over to a different attorney i think maybe this is a subject for a i mean we supposed to you know one of the things we kind of faulted um you know not the last council but ones that went many many times before that was in 22 years never reviewing the attorney's contract and i think we said that every year we were going to take a look at it well it's that year so um if we want to set up for a work session and maybe get you know explore this a little bit fuller i think that's what we're supposed to be doing we're really supposed to be looking at all contracts every year um i'd ask lynn to prepare that list and he did and thank you and um i'm i'm fine with let's have that discussion maybe we have a work session in august and decided i think that's about the year's anniversary and uh if if we collectively decide that um he's good wonderful and gets another year and if he's not doing what we expect then it's up to us to make changes or make suggestions and make a shift if we have to good mark i agree with that i think it's something that the council intended to do anyways to review all contracts we just ought to probably get in depth and see where the city's going i will say this you know there's things that have propped up over the last year we never expected so there was a lot of unexpected stuff that came up and i think we need to consider that but on another note i'd like to make mention putting in the budget a possible another employee in public works um you know we've heard about lynn doing things on the weekend and i don't think it's fair to him if we had any other city manager um you know we'd be paying for another employee to come in on weekends and empty garbage cans and do the work that he's been doing he pitches in like one of the guys but i don't think it's fair to him and i don't think it's it's fair to us really we need to really address it and look forward if we need another employee or a part-time employee let's put it on a budget take a good look at that what's your view on that jody i had this conversation with lynn earlier we're talking about the um uh code enforcement officer that we're using the sheriff and we've got a budget of 40 000 for that position and getting a sheriff 12 hours a week um i think that money would be better spent with a code enforcement officer um and maybe you know lynn had proposed maybe doing more of an in-house trying to work with the staff he currently has but you know to your point marv i don't like to hear that he's out emptying trash cans on the weekend so um so you know i don't know how what that looks like but my point is we've got 40 000 sitting there you could pay another staff member get our code enforcement brought back in-house and have maybe some extra hands to do those weekend duties that need to be taken care of so just just a thought morph jody i'll agree with you maybe it could be a combination code enforcement public works person to do double duty in that regard and take the load off when it's needed and maybe that would help things flow a little better and and take lynn out of that picture totally and give him time to do other things that's that's my thought lynn this is councilmember swept can you um give us your opinion on it what do you think well you know i i thank everyone for the thought of taking me out of it you know it it's not like i mined it and i think i've got a staff here right now uh and and i do propose bringing the code enforcement back inside uh i think the value that we're paying is not there you know it's 48 dollars an hour for the code enforcement officer from the sheriff i think that uh we could utilize that money and possibly get a a part-time person my thought uh is to take uh laura's doing the administration take her and put her out on the street early every day uh in that time frame and then occasionally on the weekends you know and that's what we're doing with the current code enforcement you know he's coming in one weekend day a month uh and then do some additional training with the public works staff and kind of get them up to date so in essence what we'll eventually have is uh myself the code enforcement person and three other people looking around also and then you know if we want to leave this money in the budget then we could look at trying to find a a part-time person to do a a mixture maybe maybe they'd do the trash and drive around the city you know on the weekends uh or or of some other situation but uh i think that potentially could work uh i've had a meeting with the staff members uh and thrown this idea out to him uh and everyone was uh committed to the situation so i i think that's a good thing it says a positive thing for the staff that that they're you know they're invested also then um first off thank you for uh what you do on the weekends you and i have had discussions on that and i i just really think it's terrific that you know sometimes you take out of your personal time to go track down a code violation and um that's great okay that is absolutely great so you and i have had this discussion i'll just share with everyone else is that basically you know the gremlins seem to come out on the weekend with the trouble and that is to me when we have to put our efforts in for code enforcement easement enforcement you name it so maybe there is something i told lynn last week i would entertain this idea and i do um i i think there may be some merit to this so i would like to see some proposals from you as to how you would do it but i think for me to support it it's going to have to have a nice component of enforcement on the weekends to just say one like we used to do one weekend a month i think with laura when she was doing it or maybe the prior code and that's just not enough it's got to be maybe one weekend off a month but it's got to be we've got to really hit those weekends because that's when they're building the houses without permits and doing the movings and you name it that's when all the fun stuff is going on because they know we're not watching well we we're currently danny the current code enforcement person is coming in one weekend a month currently uh i haven't seen his report from the last because he was just here over this weekend but uh occasionally he'll find one or two uh but i think we can do that i've got one of the public works staff also coming in they work a new shift now sunday through thursday sunday through friday that'd be a heck of a shift no sunday through thursday so you know i think doing something like that and and trying to find another person to help fill in i think uh that will work laura's doing the administration already so anything danny brings forward that needs to have a letter or do any of that stuff uh laura's already doing it and i i like i said i think the staff as a total is committed to doing whatever we need to do going forward but uh so i i think we can accomplish this it'll be a i guess how i look at it we had a trial period with the sheriff this year and i think we can have a trial period doing it another way and move forward marv you're next i just had a quick question for lynn lynn are we under contract on that code enforcement we have to re is a contract going to renew it it uh it's a separate from the sheriff so we would have a we would have to i'd bring it to you to renew it so we have to make a decision by september then yeah well i'm going to bring you the sheriff's contract at the next meeting or we could renew it and use as least hours as we want to that's another option can we go month to month well i mean it seems like we have to have a discussion here of a couple things so we might as well maybe do an august work session or something i don't think there's any other meetings in august other than our regular council meeting but i'm guessing you know this is not a topic for a regular council meeting but um maybe we'd do it you know and get that answer to you but so you could have it maybe for august and by the end of august if that helps if you can you can prepare the financial information in your proposals yeah i can you know right now you know if we leave the money in the budget then we can always adjust and move it where we need to move it within the the uh general fund budget so the money wouldn't go away we'll just use it accordingly repurpose it more two things one the city staff lynn has done a great job on reorganizing it and everything is working well and by putting another person on and helping them out and having that team work together i think it'd be a great idea the next thing is i know lynn and i have had a conversation with where are the police in the city and i know they all have a gps on the car when we had our own officers there were two in the city one left occasionally to take someone to jail or do other duties but they never left so the issues that we're having with the beach access were almost non-existent when we had our own police department but that's never going to return and i think there should be conversation between both cities so that beller shore can up there part of the contract and we can maybe maybe not up it but say hey guys you're you know how many hours are you really spending in the city where are you uh and kind of keep a handle on that i don't know how it would be done um i know there's resistance on using the gps locating but i think all of us can agree that you very seldom see them roaming around even on the weekends yes they roam around but then where do they go the rest of the time i mean there's 12 hours they're supposed to be strictly in the city but that's the issue or between both cities so where the heck are they that's all i have to say about the contract coming up i don't know how we could do anything else and what the contract what the sheriff puts out but i i i would hope to think that to be something we could do to make sure they're in the city more than what they are then last year i reached out to clearwater i'm not going to do that this year i think that's something that if it's going to be done it should come through you at this point but um you know there's new management up there there's a new mayor up there last year their response was no they're the only other uh in law enforcement agency that could possibly handle our city at this point in time but you know i'm just wondering just for due diligence i mean every year you know the sheriff's going up we've we've heard complaints we had a resident come forward last month objecting to the 400 plus thousand that we're spending on police um to mars point i mean i sit in front of my window all day i'm not looking at it all day but i am working and sometimes i don't see a car a car go by for hours and hours on end and knowing from experience it takes about two hours to drive the entire city if you're driving slowly um i should be seeing a car every couple hours and we're not seeing it and it's not that they're on calls because you know thankfully month to month we've had very low if any crime so um i don't know where they are maybe they're doing something or investigating or i don't know but um there's a perception issue here and it's not the first person i've heard it from we have speeding we have you know other issues that are going on and and i guess there's other you know there's concerns so i don't know that we have an alternative but maybe we should at least look for it number one and then number two is you know is there a better way we can get better value for our money i don't know if there's an answer to that either yeah i'll reach out to clearwater but i'm guessing they're going to tell us the same thing i'm guessing you're right because because they've been reached out too many times in the past and they they've always said you know we don't want anything to do with that but that's that's uh you know i think a lot of times we we get you know the sheriff's contract went up about 2.6 percent this year uh it's 503 000 and there's a lot of benefits that we get with the sheriff as far as you know if there's backups or things that we need you know there's deputies surrounding us so if something would happen that's a benefit so at this point uh you know i we've got two new deputies that are coming on into our city started they just started friday well one started friday another one started to today no both of them started friday so that's been a problem with the sheriff they've had a lot of shuffling with all this uh closure and beach stuff and things of that nature so i'm hoping that this six month window we're keeping lydia and uh officer monado mal tanato got to get it out of there uh he he's he's staying uh and lydia is staying and then we've got uh oliver little that's coming in on knights and uh ernest blanken his last name uh is coming in uh on the day shift where over the last few months ernest fielding and uh i i did speak with captain liner and voice these concerns that that some of you are talking about i you know i want to know where they're at too uh and uh you know why why aren't these things getting enforced uh and you know if if you want to give them a warning the first time give them a warning but put a piece of paper on their windshield or something because because i think that's a lot of the problem that people are saying no they didn't do anything they just drove through the parking lot and didn't do anything to them or you know they drove through the neighborhood didn't you know i i think our community is more in tune to the fact that we have an officer that communicates with us and i did speak to the new day officer and i will be speaking to the new night officer also you need to you know be a community police officer and speak to people when you see them don't just drive by and going down the street because that's not what our community is about and fortunately over the years we've had a lot of those officers that have been that way and i relayed that also to captain liner on friday so we'll we'll see what happens over the next 30 days with the new officers dave have we relayed clear directives to uh pinellas county about what it is exactly we're looking for yes yeah we we've had those meetings and i know it seems like sometimes they it doesn't click and i will say over the last four or five months with all this closure and non-closure the deputies we used to have they left for whatever reason and i don't think we were getting what i consider i'll call a quality deputy and i think that hurt us in some respects so you know all of that was brought up with captain liner and also the patrol captain uh nick lacerus you know because i'll give you an example i i question where a deputy was over fourth of july uh during the daytime because i was out two or three times every day and you know he does have they do have gps on them but i the thing that concerns me is if they see you out in your yard or walking down the street they're not acknowledging you and i think that's an important part of what our residents are looking for and and i relayed that to captain liner again on friday glenn yes glenn you know coming from the military you always had standing orders and protocol and when when we've discussed these sorts of things with the sheriff's office we've gotten pushback you know hey they want to come on watch and and basically have a uh a free uh reign on on how they patrol and conduct their their their watch and they kind of resist any they they resist directed patrols they don't they don't like that sort of thing i guess but i think at some point we need to be a little more prescriptive about you know what our level of expectation is and and lynn and i have talked about uh delivery of services and and uh a follow-on is in all of these areas code enforcement uh trash that kind of stuff is what is the level of service that is expected by our residents and what is the level of service to be provided by the city uh at a reasonable cost and again aligning those those expectations so uh i i i've always uh kind of felt like we need to be a little more prescriptive in where we want them to patrol how often we want them to drive by a certain location uh you know that sort of thing that's that's all i can say on that thank you anyone else do we have any other comments on the budget uh council we do have i noticed there's uh bill luskin a person named alex here um as citizens we normally this we're not making a decision so we're not required to hear from citizens but we've traditionally always opened up the floor to citizens so i will ask if no one has any objection if the citizens have anything they'd like to discuss or bring to our attention i'd like to open it up to their to the floor for them anybody have an objection to that there being none then patty um we have bill lusk and alex i don't know if they wish to comment but if they can raise their hand electronically um if they wish to speak no thank you mayor thank you bill okay no other comments okay i think lynn then there's a few items but overall it looks like the budget's uh in pretty good shape here a few items to bring to our attention i guess that'll come up to our attention for the next council meeting you'll pass it out at yeah what what i'll do uh this is our proposed budget if we uh we'll clarify the 40 000 in code enforcement that's one thing uh the uh we may add a a few thousand dollars to get uh engineer uh to look at the mechanical thing as jody suggested uh but everything oh and a few thousand dollars we'll put in there is a a placeholder whether we use it or not uh for the possibility of having someone is a security screener we'll call it uh but if we don't use the money then it'll stay and it won't go anywhere else so uh i'll just put a you know 10 000 initially in there for that and if we have to shuffle money we'll shuffle it at that point in time but so what that would do uh it would probably raise the reserve amount uh in a round number uh it would probably be somewhere around 280 000 and i'll adjust it to that point that we would have to take from the reserves based on the the items that we discussed so at this point we'll we'll adjust those and add them into the appropriate department and then go from there with that and uh then i'll send you out another clean copy very well thank you and you're also going to speak to clearwater good luck with that actually they were very nice last year they just weren't interested so who knows maybe it's changed we'll see you know they don't have the revenues that they had last year you might get a different response we'll see i don't think anybody has a revenues ahead there you go so you know that can be a game changer folks if there's nothing else then we'll adjourn this meeting and start the next one do we have a motion to i'm sorry jody i did have one other item that i mentioned to lynn and i i know we beat this to death before but um just revisiting the marina um rates and or maybe looking at a utility fee for the marina because we're spending seventy five hundred dollars a year on utilities out there um you know i know being a voter it's they're pretty good rates that we're offering to both residents and non-residents and just another potential maybe way to have a little bit of revenue bump in that department um anyone have any feeling on that any feedback on such a thing i i and i'll just tell you i took that divided by the 19 slips we have and it would to break even it would be 32 a month i'm just saying like could we propose like a 20 a month utility fee and keep the rates as they are dave um i had a question about that i'm i'm looking at the uh the number of slips i see 19. uh out of that how many lynn how many are actually residents of bel air beach versus outside there is a list in your budget i'm trying i'm going to look for the page real quick page 67 say you beat me to it jody okay all right so i'm seeing here that's the page i was actually looking at all right so that that makes sense non-resident there's not a lot of non-residents but um you know it's it it would make sense that if you did not live here you should be charged for yeah well and and they are but uh and this kind of ebbs and flows with the tide because you know at times there's been more non-residents there than residents and it's just the the situation now it appears there's more property owners than non-residents i'm not a boater but i'm i'm with jody on this i mean i think whatever the market will bear on that it's a great marina you're you're at your boat in about 30 seconds from the parking lot um i know we don't have other facilities and stuff like that but whatever that's worth on the fair market and maybe a little a little premium because let's face it you're parking your car in bellaire beach it's a nice place hell you could even park your car there and go across the street and swim in the water there's not too many marinas that have that kind of a setup and everything we don't we don't wear house the boats or anything like that that's about all i know about boating in marinas but um it seems like a pretty sweet deal to me and if jody says we can raise the rate a little bit based on her experience i'm going to defer to her and i think we should get whatever the market will bear on it marv lynn i know we've got money in a budget to upgrade to marina but i'm sure there's some boats over there that have 50 foot or 50 amp connections to power and the other thing some of them utilize water some boats can actually use uh potable water to cool the air conditionings in the boat so i don't know if we monitor all that i've never looked at it but um i just wonder what our actual utility costs are there you know what they are for the marina well the the the budget number is pretty close to what it costs us annually uh i can tell you that where is it we don't have it broke out by by each slip so we would have to the only way to do that technically would be to to make each slip have its own meter and each slip have its own water meter uh and there are some marinas that do that and then there's other marinas that have a flat utility fee like jody said so uh that cost is kind of intermixed with the lighting the parking and all of that lighting that's there also so well the point is if somebody leaves their water run i mean we're paying for it if somebody has their boat you know battery chargers and uh air conditioning systems running on the city's power it'd be nice to know who's doing what and charge them accordingly well i don't other than metering them separately i don't think you're you know which would be a a pretty large expense to convert all that i don't think you're i think jody's philosophy or uh direction on it is much more palatable to just making an average fee jody i have you next and then dave gaddis and robin does the person with you want to speak just kidding jody you're next then dave um dave you go because my phone's my house phone's ringing no one ever calls me on that so i'm probably gonna get a message here in a minute so you go and then i'll take it okay dave well basically what i was going to say is uh rather than metering these these uh like the electricity in the water obviously water is something that everyone should be provided as part of that because you have to flush these boats out every time you use them if you have a boat that you know requires it's not a full-time in-water boat but as far as electricity goes that should be a premium and if nothing else there should be a way to turn it off and on and lock it so if you want electricity you actually pay for that service and it's tacked onto your bill it's just an additional fee that goes right along with your slip rental you finishing um yeah i so that was my thought was just along those lines is one it would be too cost prohibitive to have meters set on every pedestal out there so every boat slip has a pedestal with power and water available um so i don't know i don't know that there's a fair way to handle it i'm can guarantee you that every boat that's in those slips when they go out they come back in and they use water rather whether it's for flushing engines or washing the salt off or you know what have you that's just happens at every marina every you know i can tell you we do it at our house so that's um expected and i think even the smaller vessels probably have a battery charger that they're plugging into even if they're not plugging in for ac and those sorts of things i don't know how many are in water boats and what they use that type of uses that's why i said would it be it's not fair to you know just say oh here's the total expense of 7 500 and you know the fee would be if we wanted to break even everyone would have to pay like 32 a month so to kind of offset some of those costs i'm not saying to we want to balance the budget but i'm just you know suggesting that and then i do have a question for you lynn is i'm looking at this this roster of um each slip and i notice we've got property owner we've got non-resident and we have resident so what are the differences well a property owner is someone that owns a property here but they may not live here the resident is someone that physically lives here and then the non-resident is someone that has no connection with the city whatsoever so are you telling me that we only have one resident property owner and the rest of the property owners don't live here and they're using use it well i'm kind of confused i think patty may be able to answer that question better maybe the resident is a renter or something yeah yeah that could be but they're property owners uh and patty takes care of this right now and we're in the gonna transition that uh actually we're gonna transition it to kyle which we've been in discussion with and so you know i think your proposal is reasonable yeah i mean i think it's very reasonable i know that we pay for the street lights out there but you know and again the only people that benefit from those street lights along the dockage is are the residents who have their votes in the marina um none of us can go walk the bulkhead down there like we used to be able to because it's gated and locked and you know so every other resident in the city cannot use can't go take a stroll down the dock so there's some you know i just they've got a great they've got a great benefit to have those slips available to them so what what is the console's thought on that i like what jody had to say if you can work out some numbers behind it i think it's a very reasonable proposal without going to separate metering which sounds like it will be very expensive any other feedback i agree with judy i like her idea i also agree with jody glenn yeah you know i i just want to make sure we understand the hidden costs it's not just a matter of uh dividing up the electricity bill by the number of slips and charging them i mean there's like there's a carrying cost for the the money there's there's a administrative fee for managing the billing that sort of stuff so understand what those hidden costs are and charge them appropriately i mean just it's not just a simple matter of dividing the electricity bill by the number of slips or the lighting costs that sort of thing that's there should be a premium for managing that sort of thing it's a nice facility and there's going to be a big difference between a boat sitting there on trickle charge versus a boat sitting there with with humans in it running an air conditioner yeah and part of the part of our problem you know if we go down the to try to compare rates and we've done that many times rate comparison yes ours has got security fencing around it i will say that most marinas don't even have that most marinas uh you can walk out on any you know if you go to dunedin to the municipal dock or to clear water to the municipal dock there's no gate that stops you from going out onto that thing so that is a benefit for the for the slip runners so and sharing in some of that cost may be the simplest way to go back what is that going to cost a person uh that has a uh we'll just say a 30 foot boat it's costing them to 210 because that's our minimum so it would be an increase of uh about 20 bucks a month so 240 dollars over the year dave um i do see that you know we have a few non-residents just curious do we have residents that are in line waiting for an opening yeah how it works you put your name on the list and uh what happens is when a slip comes open we go to the resident list first if we have no residents that want to slip because people will put their name on the list and you know it could be on there for six months or a year and then they say no i don't want that slip anymore so then we go to the next person uh so that's how a non-resident ends up there oh marv i think you were next yeah lynn question i have or not question but they do make some cheap meters in-line meters that can be put on um maybe down the road if you know just try one and just see what the usage is on some of these larger boats the ones that have the water connected all the time which could be for air conditioning or whatever and uh you know you've got some boats maybe have uh 25 to 50 gallon holding tanks in there for waste water and um fresh water for their sinks or toilets or whatever else have you so it may be more than what we imagine as far as water yeah okay i'll i'll do a little more on that and kind of give you some feedback on that at the work session actually in august if that's okay thank you jody for raising that one that's a good idea does anybody else have anything else on the budget discussion before we call it we have a motion to adjourn solved and a second second all in favor aye aye aye okay we're adjourned and we'll immediately start the next one i don't have this printed out so this is patty are you ready to go or do you have to separate tapes or anything like that no we're going to run a continual especially sorry i have to talk this way because i got my other computer where this is on special city council meeting city of bel air beach um it was set to uh start right after the beginning of the end of this other meeting and my screen just blacked out um it's 7 58 so i'm calling that meeting to order um we'll stand for the pledge of allegiance again i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all for all madam clerk please call the role council member robin ockey here council member mark bean council member dave gavis here council member jody shirley here council member rita here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo yeah and city manager lynn reese here okay thank you everyone we've got two items on here the first item uh both set by the city manager first is consideration of setting the tentative millage rate for 2020 through 21. city manager yes uh the staff is recommending that we set the millage rate at the current millage rate of 2.0394 uh this is not the final millage rate but setting this at we we cannot go any higher than this when we come to the budget hearing in september so i'm recommended that we stay status quo that's an increase of about 4.28 percent uh from the rollback rate uh and that will bring uh about 59 000 uh revenue into the budget uh for next year so i'm recommending that we set the tentative millage rate at 2.0394 which for the record that's been that way for like six or seven years correct mr reeves yes okay but again we're we would be looking at an increase in revenue due to the increase approximate almost five percent increase that we have in our property values this year thanks to the uh appreciation yes that's correct okay we have any discussion council on that and again this was the and i just want to clarify this i know there's two people um listening in this is not a final rate this is the maximum rate we can go it is possible that this rate can be lowered um you know through further discussions uh lynn has gonna give us more information there's still more discussion to go there's gonna be two public hearings on this budget also so depending on the feedback we get anything can happen to us but what can't happen is that that rate will not go higher this is the cap i'm going to agree with city manager reed's recommendation that we stay with what we're at at the 2.0394 anyone else jody you know we we talked about this um last budget season and i still feel strongly about it i'm more leaning towards and you know i know this isn't that this isn't the final decision but i like the idea of a roll back and keeping everyone's taxes where they are and i i'm you know i know it's not a huge number i think we're talking about roughly fifty thousand dollars but i you know i think that uh we can find fifty thousand dollars somewhere in the budget so that's just my two cents jody i agreed with you last year i'm gonna agree with you again this year um i i ran out of no new taxes thing i know it's difficult i know the police go up every year unfortunately we have you know that's just the cost of living and i know that we um you know sometimes garbage goes up every year i think we did a good job at cost containment last year but i i'm in favor of keeping it at the rollback i will vote to cap this tonight but that does not mean i'm going to support the passage of this when we get to the actual item in fact if it has an increase i'm most likely gonna well i'll probably join you jody but i'm not i didn't vote for it last year and i just can't do that um i think we have to be very vigilant about coming up with new sources of revenue if our costs go higher you just gave one tonight that's been overlooked for many many years and there's probably others out there if we put our thinking caps on so um so that's i agree with you 100 on it marv i think we did a great job overall last year staff did a good job we've saved money uh all the way around and uh we're very diligent uh looking at every possible angle the thing that worries me a little bit is the state's loss of revenue and that may affect us a little bit and by staying where we're at i think we just might break even at the end of the year that's what i'm thinking i hate to say it but i think our uh conditions here in the state of florida and the loss of revenue throughout from travel and whatever else is going to hurt us a little bit so i'm thinking i'll just leave it where it is for now i agree with lin's recommendation uh i think that uh between the virus uh past present and future uh we have not yet seen what's gonna happen and i think honestly we're probably better off keeping it without the roll back and let's see where things fall maybe next year will be better and we can uh go back to the rollback route but i i just think right now it's too risky and uh the last thing we need is to be in a position to where we cannot afford to uh run the city in the proper manner any other council comments before i open it up to the citizens we do have to hear from citizens on this mayor mr left can you see mr lusk has his hand raised i just see his that it's muted so if they will on if they can be unmuted and if they have ice see mr alex is dropped off so now i have bill lusk unmuted mr lusk if you wish to speak the floor is yours thank you is it out of line to go backwards to what you had adjourned on before in regards to the marina um yeah this is well this is i mean maybe not it's this is on the on the adoption of the budget rate so to the effect that it might affect the budget rate go ahead and speak nothing to add on the budget rate i had my hand raised it was ignored and just for the record a couple comments on the marina okay i don't have a picture of you and i can't see when you're raising your hand but just you know what i want to hear the comment and if council doesn't mind just dispensing with the rules for a second i want to hear what mr lusk had to say everybody's giving me a thumbs up see thumbs up so go ahead mr lusk just so you know i can't see you so i i don't know what you're doing that's no big deal thank you you know i do it every year i've been down there a long time and i'll help a little bit uh i'll do another study to help everybody with competitiveness that's one side of the variable as far as gates yes you can go down to clearwater yourself you can go to dunedin you can see in gulfport you can go to saint pete they are all locked they all are lit the one big difference and i think things have changed within the last year is that we have a minimum of 30 feet and i i don't want to take up too much time because you're moving along and i don't want to but i'll address this little different remote the new study there are a lot of residents that don't have 30-foot boats but we're paying 30-foot rates there are a lot of residents that don't use electric that don't run uh 24 7 electric to their boat or for that matter even charge so just some consideration for open-mindedness i don't think anyone on council is currently tied to the marina or maybe even not a boater but i'd be happy to provide what is current in regards to competitive rates and address this discussion i'll take your guidance how you want me to do it if council is okay with that i'd like it mr lusk if you could just route that through lynn reeves then he could pass it on or patty gentry he they could pass it on to us that would be fantastic very much appreciated thank you uh another opportunity to speak when you discuss it again would be great too sorry to interrupt your flow there no it's okay thank you no do we have no other citizen comments correct okay okay then i'm going to come back to council what i'm going to need is because we had consideration we just discussed it lynn has made a proposal now that we we stick basically with the millage rate this is our cap and it's a 2.0394 so if we could get a motion a second then we'll open it up for final for a discussion here we'll run through it real quickly and then we can vote on this because we're gonna we have to approve that tonight correct mr reeves yes correct okay okay so do i have a motion okay and the motion just to clarify is to adopt the city manager's recommendation of a 2.039 millage rate cap that's our preliminary millage to be voted on after the public sessions we're all in agreement with that right it's the tentative military tentative village that's better said yes thank you does anybody need to discuss any further i'm just curious who seconded it at the same time i can't tell who thank you okay and then no other council comments no other citizen comments right mr lusk you're good i'm good thank you mayor thank you okay back to council dave gaddis last word uh just like i said i think we should trust lynn and with everything that's going on we don't want to paralyze ourselves with another lockdown so before the council is the motion to adopt a 2.0394 tentative millage rate for this upcoming year patti gentry would you please call the roll council member gattis aye councilmember shirley hi council member swope aye councilmember aki aye council member beam aye vice mayor gunn aye mayor mandel aye so it passes uh seven to zero the tentative millage rate is 2.0394 city manager please factor that into all your calculations for the budget yes thank you so move to item number two again sorry for turning sideways here authorize the city manager to execute an agreement for stormwater rate category development through pinellas county utilities and budget amendment approval the description is to approve the agreement with pinellas county which we were provided do i have a motion first that's mark b making the motion and second second second by dave gaddis marv beam no i open it up uh mayor you can carry it from here we've discussed it many times and uh i'm fine with it do we want to defer to lynn just for his explanation of this probably a good idea okay mayor and console uh this is part of the implementing the storm water rate fee uh the county has a vendor that has redone their software so this cost originally was going to be twenty three thousand six hundred and twenty five dollars uh i did go back to them and question the cost and uh in discussions and through a couple emails we got the cost reduced to sixteen thousand to six hundred and twenty five dollars uh i'm recommending approval of this this is so we can establish so they can establish uh the software program to start collecting these fees and if the council approves it i will give them the go-ahead in the morning to move this forward so everything uh moves forward for the stormwater rate this is a one-time fee it's not uh going to be charged every year annually when was that 16 06 did you say 16 625 dollars okay and i i sent you the uh updated agreement i also provided you the original email which was uh as i said was 23 625 dollars and uh i'm glad we went back to them and said hey come on here cut us some slack so pinellas county is is gonna do uh some of the testing for us that they have to do to make sure it works when they do the billing process then i have only one question and that's a great job of cost cutting there do you have any other choice in this or are they basically our sole source for this yeah they're the sole source and this is this is their vendor so they're the ones that do the billing for us any other comments or questions i'll open it up to the public mr lusk all set thank you thank you sir back to the council with last word by uh marv beam no i'm i'm good with it i know that lynn did go back to the county and reduce the fees very happy about that thanks lynn and uh hey we've got to move forward on this it'll help us in the end thanks for the good negotiation lin we're ready to take it to vote okay so what we're here to do now is to authorize the city manager to execute an agreement for stormwater rate category development through pinellas county utilities and budget amendment approval he just told us that the cost is a one-time fee of sixteen thousand six hundred and twenty-five dollars payable to the county that's basically our sole source provider of this um madam clerk would you please call the roll council member shirley aye council member swope aye council member aki aye council member beam aye council member gavis hi vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo hi so it passes seven to zero city manager if you would please as soon as possible you said tomorrow morning but whenever you can get to it let them know that you've got the okay sign whatever's necessary if i need to sign something just get it to me i certainly will do that for you and um let's proceed with it thank you mayor and consul and i want to thank you for all your support through this budget process and also thank the staff uh kyle laura patty for helping put this together and the financial consultant uh andy and heather i think they did a great job in putting this budget that's a little more streamlined than we've seen in the past and i appreciate all your input and we'll make the edits and uh i'll get back to you at the the work session in august lynn maybe it's you know that we the newer council members have two years experience and the and the senior ones have three but this seemed to be a very smooth process this year and um and i think it was much more streamlined and it shows a lot of hard work um from you and everybody who's you know associated with this so uh kudos to everyone involved with this i think it's a better budget it's much more easily understood and certainly by the public it'll be easier understood so anytime we're doing that we're effectively communicating so excellent job thank you thanks um with that folks that's all that's on our agenda so we can move forward adjournment at this point in time do i have a motion don't move and a sec i think we had a motion and a second there we have a second right all in favor aye aye our next meeting is the next council meeting correct mr reeves yes uh august 3rd uh at this point we have not heard from the governor that he's extending beyond august 1st uh once we do then we'll figure out which way we're going yeah with record with record deaths and um and cases my bet is if anybody wants to bet a drink that he will extend it yeah i guess i'm guessing he will but you know it seems like he's always waiting till the last minute that he will do last time he did it we went to the night before so um but we're ready to go either way this i think worked out well today dave again thank you for jumping in and making that quick trip down there to get it all working this worked great after we got it done so with that we're adjourned everyone and thank you and be safe and have a good weekend and uh good week and we'll see you in august third thank you all right stay safe stay healthy thanks you two more bye-bye bye"
