    "transcript": "good evening everyone uh welcome to the june 21st city council work session for the city of valler beach please remind us for the pledge [Music] i pledge allegiance to the flag in the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all adam clerk please call him councilmember robinaki council member frank banker council member glenn gunn here council member leslie otero here councilmember rita swope here vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves city attorney fred reilly here all right thank you uh let everyone know we have a code of conduct we run these meetings via an opportunity to order that's the rules of the game that's the way we're playing it tonight we had some problems last time i'm hoping we're not going to have that again i intend to follow the rules today item one discuss community center marquis sign replacement sign replacement is the topic city manager brought it mr reeves uh as all of you know we've been talking about the city sign for months and months and months the insurance as i mentioned at the last meeting said that uh we either needed to move forward or he was going to pay us an appreciated amount which is about four thousand dollars we would get some replacement value of somewhere in the ten to twelve thousand dollar raise from the insurance uh i've asked mike vogel he's here uh we went back he was the low bidder last time we went back got a revised quote from him with some modifications but i asked him to come and have a little discussion with the council and if you've got questions uh he can kind of go over what he came back with and [Music] maybe we can get some direction on this hopefully so um if you uh actually why don't you just slide out because well thank you uh for having me here um all council members mr regionals um what i'm going to do is just get any questions i guess at this point i think you probably offer the signage i think you've got some in front of you design for the community so if you have any questions um let's start there and i can [Music] how answer the proposal as it stands right now um it was less expensive to do non-digital which was why armstrong was more expensive to do non-digital so it's like well then that's two digital and no it's more expensive to do digital media price includes the digital display that's a nine millimeter display and let me explain a little bit about the nine column here led should be 16 you know 30 millimeters millimeters is the distance between leds so the tighter the leds in the space nine the more tighter the resolution so they can go anywhere from three now all the way up to we pretty much keep around 15 for readability uh what you have here is a color unit and it's about 9 millimeters so you get the readability a good output and the size of the included here you get enough lines that can be altered you can go from six inch line you know vary the lines depending on your uh copy and the image you want to pursue so it's a very good unit as far as millimeters that can always be changed if you like this is a color unit that can always be changed if you like you can go to a monochrome unit which is a little bit less expensive um but really the market kind of used for color but that's up to you what's the impact resistance on the uh excuse me you have to put that microwave what's the impact resistance on the sun because most of these digital signs are like watching divine impact uh storm comes out 35 miles an hour this unit yeah this is designed for 150 mile an hour which is by code it is engineered stamped by the state of florida so the unit itself is engineered at 150 miles an hour the unit the sign itself structure is stamped engineered by the state of florida so all your concerns as far as hurricane winds and whatnot should be alleviated because it's structurally sound or state of florida what is the uh maintenance requirements of these signs is there much maintenance to them does it have a warranty meeting the because this is oliver d it used to be that we used to use neon um used to use fluorescent lights those were more less efficiencies are examining energy leds have approximately 100 000 hours of illumination so you shouldn't have any really down time and even i believe the community center which is eliminated that's illuminated with leds as well so everything here is led illuminated including your logo off of a 12 volt power supply so your minimal output of energy is reduced significantly because we're only using leds and 100 volt very low voltage so as far as that goes um low voltage lows energy consumption you shouldn't have much as far as maintenance um if the unit you do have a warranty if anything happens to the trunk unit or in fact it'll sign itself we get a one-year manufacturer uh from us on the unit of the sign itself and then the uh the led unit is warranty for five years starts number i have a question um consuming the overall height is nine feet that's pretty darn big compared to what we used to have it used to happen i can tell you you're eight foot four inches overall on your previous side okay so this is a little bit tower not much but mainly the height is due to that feature we have on top that wave feature so i'm curious is this sign scalable at all or is this dead you can reduce the size as much as you want but remember if you reduce the size you reduce it with copy you reduce the led board so as you reduce the legibility coming over the bridge every direction is reduced as well slice rust [Music] [Music] a similar unit not quite as extravagant but a similar unit did ready to chores and michael robinson i thought you know michael robertson he's a commissioner there and we've had that thing up for probably a year or so so i would welcome any of you who call mr robinson um see how the elixir came in it's right on above very similar to this one and what's the price difference between this is for color the monochromic and then the non-digital okay uh between this the monochromatic um i don't know off-hand i would say probably i'm guessing on five thousand dollars but if you want to pursue that and certainly do a proposal and get that back to you uh the ones where you actually used to have when you put things up front you were talking about it being a little bit more expensive it is a little more expensive because we have to manufacture two separate cabinets uh as opposed to this unit which just slides in so it was a little bit more labor mode and then you've got the changing changeable letters when somebody has to physically go out and put your messages up this one you can run on a schedule unit so for instance you can run this a year on your calendar so maybe whatever day you want to put your message you can put it in it'll automatically that day change it so really it's pretty easy to just let your on go so you can change it at any time the other good feature by helco i mean it's every tuesday you can get on their uh get under a call and they will answer media questions they will help you with any uh scheduling anything you want they're willing to answer any questions to help you and that's happening it's every tuesday everyone what are you looking at as far as time wise mean time any time the lead time basically is two things um manufacturing sign doesn't take long it's within four weeks what will take the longest is to guarantee boarding they have to ship it so i'm going to say [Music] other than that no we look pretty good our suppliers have had us supplies what we've done we have a storage warehouse in the back and we had a little foresight so we pre-ordered a lot of the stuff a lot of the aluminum bottom plywood so um to kind of get hedge against some of that like fiber also looking at it here on the basis to be determined is that price included or is that still that used to be purchased i think what we were talking about the stone we've got stone it kind of matches whatever um that's to be determined if you want to go to come out you know if you want to go painted like the cabinet um that could be something that you altered so that's kind of where i'm looking at the support it says that's to be determined by a state certified engineer that's right we know that already or you know we know 45 years so what's the communication [Music] [Music] and then you just do it it's wireless essentially so as well not just in buildings do you have access to the computer system here from home you can set it up that way if you have a id number you can set up an id number and anybody at home can change it and what was the final bid for us i'm sorry it was 20 i'm sorry 39.775 plus max now the display itself is can that be either a banner display or a steady constant display uh typically in the state of florida they don't encourage your actual amount of encouragement you can't rotate you can't move the electronics because it's distracting traffic so what happens um you should think about let's say this he says see website [Music] okay and the last question i have then is the illumination the brightness can be generally changed it automatically changes 256 degrees 256 different degrees of brightness so it automatically changes with it with the sun so if it's an overcast state it will recognize that and change accordingly did you have a chance to override it so that's just too bright you can override that to whatever you want okay so um automatic to see how that goes because it really works pretty well so you want to give it the maximum visibility so you don't want to get them so typically illumination for electronics is measured in mints and this is this company knows about 14 000 nits and over a period of about five or six years that led's all of these you have to decrease in the importance but by the time after 10 years it might be you know 789 000 units so it's still very viable it just as leds do they never made it over in four years a lot of companies will start at 10 000 so after a period of time they're well under the 7 000 minutes which is the kind of the gold zone for readability so um you can see where i elgo gets to push up a notch so when it does come down it's still all over the 7 000 minutes that's typical for me so as the display itself starts to wear out if the sign itself is in good these are panels each panel these are in like 12 or 12 rounds so let's say it starts after 10 years you you want to you can just replace the pounds however i would say because electronics it's probably going to be cheaper in 10 years to just replace it as opposed to what it is today so and the technology would be better as well so apples but probably in 10 years there will be smaller millimeters for the same price so just as a rough order magnitude what would it cost to just change [Music] do you want to open this up for citizen comments it's an option on a work session it's not [Music] thank you and debate this a little bit ourselves here here i just let me say if if whatever you decide to do if you want to change this i'm always open to changing whatever you want if you want to get certain items on whatever you want to do to see the device now you can do that so just you know that i'm here and we'll work with you guys so thank you for coming in with us and answering questions mr reed you want to come back and you want to so we can't vote tonight on this as you know the most we can do tonight is just discuss this there's been i will say a lot of citizen input in here some of those citizens i know are not here uh to voice that input now but i doubt that their you know opinion has probably changed there's been a lot of people against this for various with our reasons it's a beautiful sign by the way a beautiful sign i mean um but whether it fits with us and whether we need it and whether we should spend 40 000 at this venture that is the question for the council to determine and also i want to hear from our citizens so with then i'll just throw up into comments man how confident are you that you can get the 12 being out of the insurance company because if you get hit it's going to roughly cost us around 28 000 give or take a few dollars well basically we're looking at roughly 20. well the adjuster sent me an email as i told you at the last council meeting that he was going to close it and give us the depreciated amount which is about four thousand dollars and i asked him to hold it and uh he has not responded he's going to close it so i said i want to talk to the council one more time and see where the concept well after this discussion tonight i'll have some more of this question with you now he told me 30 days when he said that and that was just before the meeting but i sent him immediately back and said hey wait i'm sure our letter for mr riley is necessary to give us a couple extra time we have to get this to the next council meeting yeah i'm fully aware of that but you know i asked mike to come to kind of clarify some questions and you know get feedback from the council and that's really what i was asking for so do you want to agree that we're going to get a yes or no vote at the next council meeting i mean we have been debating this for quite some time i want to if they're going to do this i want this publicized not buried on page 100 a minute of the agenda put it as item number one well not you know one but number three four whatever it is put it up front let the citizens know and then everyone can come and speak if they can't speak they can write in whatever they have to do so that the council gets the full range of opinions and then we all can make our decision yeah i think most of just most of the comments were light splashed that that's what i heard from a lot of them uh and i did talk to mike about that and the light splashes is minimalistic in the scheme of things it's no different than a street light you know but we're a long ways from really anybody's house you know several hundred feet in some cases several yards so i don't think the light's flashing he may be able to give you some more feedback on that yes like i mentioned before um members so i would strongly suggest if you're calling michael uh making a trip down there just driving that area the benefits of just information hurricanes is certainly a big impact i do have one more question about the brightness you said that you could override the automatic light adjustment does that adjust the range of the can you adjust the automatic portion of it or is it all automatic we have no control or it's a manual you can set it however you want the automatic adjusts with the apps with the lighting issues um you can go in and say hey at five o'clock i wanted to be experts and they would do it that way so you have a range of options for the brightness i think you'll find that it's probably not that big a deal i don't want to minimize that but again i would encourage you to go to a place where it has it because i think you'll find especially the only neighbors over here they're you've got a little trees i really don't see an issue with that i really don't but again again i would encourage all of you to take that ride and see for yourself and maybe you talk to others like that one that's in running some chores that's pretty much similar to this very soon problems even in size actually that was a little bit i think this is a little bit bigger than this um you know i think i've surveyed a couple of places that are putting in some different signs and initially the feedback is pushed back but once they go in people are very receptive to it because they like the information that's being passed on the other thing is this light splash issue we've heard from a few very vocal people and we had a communications committee actually comprised of some of the members of the council and some of the members in the audience here and their recommendation was to go forward with the digital side i think we very adequately answered some of the concerns of the vulnerable residents because we can't turn this thing down it's not going to be the fireworks this way that some people are concerned with it also along with the water quality studies that the city pander's done he's also done some light surveys out there a light splash from it from this size would be minimal compared to just the street lights and delightful disabilities i think we've done a good job of answering all the concerns of the residents and i think we should move forward with the recommendations of the communications committee and our communications strategic focus within the council thank you my only comment is this is my first point of this um i can't i can't see why we expect this is going to cost us 42 000 yen insurance total price for the 42 i just knocking down 28. a lot of money have we sought out i think the old sign was perfectly fine um indiana speech still has saliva letters and selective numbers in it we reached out to trade schools see what they were doing for donation building trades or whatever using the insurance money um i just uh if i looked across the street i wouldn't want that i wouldn't want to be looking at them right your comment is not one or two residents it's a lot of residents they tried this stunt a few years ago on the corner the room was filled with people it was prior to our council citizens you know you can't have it both ways we love the character of bel air beach and we don't want change and we don't want business but i put a digital sign make it look like a casino again no offense to your son i've seen them i've seen reddington's stores i've seen largos the other thing is hypocrisy we don't have the money to fix our we turned out a 200 000 parks grant last year because there's only 50 000 a year out of our pockets here so don't fix your thing with your parts but put a 50 000 sign that not one person and i get the complaints not one person to say hey what happened to the sign i rely on that you know the communications community first off doesn't tell us what to do they suggest so they work for us not the other way around i appreciate their hard work but they also said use the technology that's out there we've got these things everybody carries them okay use it text people actually other stuff you don't need a fifty thousand dollars funding this is somebody gets their emergency information here you know an emergency is survival of the fittest and if you're getting your information off of a digital sign in front of city hall you may not make it okay there's way better ways of getting more information try like the national weather service and people like that so emergency management from pinellas so i i'm not in favor of this sign at this point i don't know that i'm in favor of any side and we had a thing where there were i think for two or three thousand dollars portable signs digital portable signs that could be put up temporarily for the amount we're talking here we could put them on almost every corner in the city if it was that important those are also computer generated they're not fancy again this is a beautiful sign do we need this and i don't think we do i was in that room where there was push back against the signs they were talking apples to oranges because we were talking about a sign further on the corner and it was also in conjunction with county signs across boulevard within the city of boundaries that's where the majority of the pushback was so far as the communications committee goes it was comprised 99 by residents and their i'm reading the recommendations correctly in our capital improvements project we have 40 or excuse me 30 000 in the budget and for prior years for a new digital sign so this is not maybe not as much of a financial hit as we might think we have that money put away in the um capital improvements project i might also add that we can look at different ways to reduce the cost but the cost is the issue i mean this is a beautiful sign i agree but we can do things here that would bring costs down a little bit such as go into monochromatic instead of a full color we can take some of the elements off if you need to we can do some things here and get costs down whether it's going to be done where you like it or where you want it i don't know we need to try and reduce some of the costs make it more manageable for you if that's something you want to look at michael i mean i you know we can sit here and you know take the little cover off and i mean i don't want to drive you crazy i think you've already come back to us with a couple of these already you're welcome to bring whatever you'd like to the next council meeting and show it to us but i do think at this point that you know what i'm hearing that insurance companies kind of get nancy here we need to call it an up-down vote on this thing and i don't care which one it really is that we vote on you know you can everybody love this little feature on the top but if we took it off we saved a few thousand and go on we save a few thousand more so maybe if price is a concern for people maybe if you want to give a bare bones one that's fine i'm not going to ask you to do any more work than you've already done i know you guys have done considerable amount of effort so far but it's up to this council if that's what they if they want to they want that if that's if there's no interest then let's not put the man through an exercise here that looks something like this is the design that this was the final design of everything that we've looked at uh over the various designs we discussed the v-shape several variations on this and i think everybody actually did like this um i'd say we put it to a vote next council meeting and put this to bed with consensus i've said it they've said glenn's well i guess i mean everybody loves the sign but i would be opposed to reducing the price and some features like i don't think we need color because that was one big thing they didn't want to be casino science i think monochrome at this time so that brings it down to 34. so i would be in favor of sign if it was cheaper because i think having this sign cause i've had residents be like where's our sign like what's happening and i keep telling them my debate and it's either coming or not so price is my big thing that's i'm going to be bothered to accommodate that as well right so know can we think is there a number that would be based on our budget and based on insurance that would be more comfortable for us have we looked at it that way what's the age what's the real insurance number you think you're gonna get forget about his blood for the four thousand but what are we really gonna get well originally he told me between 10 and 12 if we replaced it that's what he told me originally and uh because there is in our insurance there's a replacement cost component and the base of that sign was like eight thousand dollars but you're gonna get some escalation is a replacement cost so what they do is they take uh what it would cost to replace and we even got a number for that to replace the sign as it existed and it was uh i want to say 12 or 13 000 as it existed so somehow however you know i'm not proven to how the insurance people work but that's that's what he told me verbally so figure 11 10 to 12 let's say that again 7 11. and we we have been putting money aside each year part of the sign with uh the caveat because we knew at some point we're going to have to replace it uh so we put this the next the budget that we're going to talk about tonight would have been the fourth year of that and you know we weren't looking at the insurance happening so we were planning on about forty thousand dollars now we don't necessarily have to use all 40. no no just because we have 40 doesn't mean go ahead with this if we can get it down no no i'm not saying that you use it i'm saying we've been saving [Music] [Music] okay so at this point we have consensus that we're going to to do two things number one like you're certainly invited back if you wish to you just heard from one council member you know we've had a lot of four to three votes of late so you know this may pass or fail by one vote so she's asked if you could have a lower number i don't think it's a bad idea so if you want to do that come up with something you know an alternative force presented and we're going to get a yes or no vote one way or the other at the next council meeting mr reeves you're not going to bury it you're going to put it up towards the top of the agenda preferably the first action item that we have to do okay everybody in favor of that yes yes okay everyone's in favor no one's supposed right that's what we're going to do then okay thank you again for coming in we'll see you next time july 7th this is thank you very much thanks again for your work on this all right so now we begin the big budget workshop to review fiscal year 2021-2020 has hopefully the budget that mr reeves gave us last time and i will turn it over to you lynn reeves okay i'm gonna be back here because i'm gonna it's it's on the screen there and uh i'm not gonna go through every single page i'm just gonna go through highlights of it uh i did give you an updated to the uh overall estimated expenditures and changes uh heather and i went through it again and so there's an update that i've put at your seat tonight i also put there uh what the rollback rate type budget would be uh and then we're gonna we'll discuss things that would have to come out of the budget if we determined to go to the rollback break so we'll start with the organizational chart what i'm proposing is to bring the code enforcement back in-house and staff will do it and we'll hire a part-time office assistant that will be no additional cost to the budget it's a warsh situation and then we would have code enforcement at least a half day every day of the week where now we really don't have that uh that that's one of my recommendations another one is to uh because at some point time i'm going to transition to retirement and i think i think what i'm recommending is we modified kyle's position in making the assistant city manager so you have a transition person at the time that i decided to retire and he has been doing a lot of things as an example this year he did the paving and curb work project i gave that to him he did the beach accesses project did several things and i'm training him in uh the community rating system this was our verification visit i had him working with me side by side to get that visit done uh of course it isn't completely completed yet but we've had the exercise with the female people already so now it's in their ball court to come back to us and tell us so that's that's one of my that's my two personnel recommendations as far as the code enforcement a lot of things get missed you know danny's only here a few hours a week and if we put him in more hours a week it would cost us significantly more we've had complaints that as an example i'll just use grass for an example driving down the street one side of the street there's high grass and on the other side there's high grass but he only sees the one on one side uh some of the other things we've had 21 cases of code enforcement only two of them have been brought by the sheriff's deputy in that time frame that we've had different code violations that we've moved forward so you know my position is uh he struggles with uh the uh building construction because he doesn't have any background in it i mean the bottom line he's a he's a deputy and he he's limited you know if if you want a deputy sheriff then i guess that's what you want but i think it it's more conducive to the residents that do call in and you know they want immediate action and a lot of times what that entails myself or laura or someone else has to go do it even though he's here eight to 12 hours a week so that's that's that uh i think it would give us a part-time office assistant in the afternoon is what i'm proposing and having free laura to go out into the city during that time frame and as i said there's no cost uh change at all it's a war between using him as he currently is used and using our own code enforcement in-house and i do think we get better service okay um before we start getting too deep into this how do you want to handle the questions do you want them now as we're going along no what i'd like to do what i'd like to do is i'll go through the budget and i and just kind of do the highlights i'm not going to go through every department i can highlight it and then come back for questions okay okay i will tell you that the citizens advisory committee reviewed and they had a few comments they reviewed the budget a week ago uh and uh a couple of comments that they made um they wanted to look at what the rollback rate would do to us uh and i've prepared that for you to be able to talk about that but for the most part uh you know we talked about the sheriff's contract and things of that nature which i'll highlight about that but for the most part i think the and there are a few members in the audience for the most part i think they were and i asked him to come tonight i think they were happy with what they saw for the most part unless i'm hearing something different so going forward if you'll uh it's the budget schedule some of the highlighted things we've got to do as you know the property value went up 6.03 percent which translates into about a 69 000 increase in the millage dollars which is about 57 of property in the city which if you take that down it's about 13 or 14 cents a day uh as far as a increase and it's based on value so the critical dates that we have uh june 19th we'll have our second workshop after you give me feedback tonight we'll do some adjustments as needed and then immediately following that we'll send this to the event july 19th yeah july did i say june yeah sorry uh july 19th we'll set the tentative millage rate and i'll tell you right now at this time i'm going to propose the 2.03 is lieutenant military [Music] that is not the final millage rate at that time but you don't want to go lower than that because you at that time you can't go back up if you're lower or lower than that so that remember that's just the tentative okay and then we'll have our first public hearing on september 20th or no september 8th excuse me and of the proposed military and at that time the council can accept the proposed military or do something else or do something in between the rollback and whatever you know number they choose to do and then the final budget hearing will be on september 20th july 1st the county will validate what they've already given us that uh 6.03 there will be an update and uh we'll have to fill out the forms for the state put in our budgetary night dates and uh that starts really the process just we have to do the same thing with the nonvelorum assessments for bellevue estates island i have to turn that estimate assessment role in by july 1st it's already been turned in i've updated it and so that's going forward okay the page just a budget summary our budget is proposed at two million six hundred and eleven thousand four hundred thirty seven dollars that's about a hundred and twenty thousand more than the previous year uh our admiral tax collection uh is proposed at twelve hundred and thirty three thousand five hundred sixty-five dollars and as i said that could change uh october or i mean uh july first it could go up could go down generally it's very close to that these are just the highlights of what the income is and then the operating expenditures include things like personnel operating cap operating capital projects and then our debt service which is when we talk about debt service it's the money that we're paying on the bond which that debt service is paid by the residents of bei and then the money we're paying for this building which we pay portland okay okay as i said uh the millage rate projection right now uh is going is currently at 6.03 the dollar change in that amount from the prior year was 35 million 837 390 and we're going to skip to [Music] this slide and that's what i gave you updated on it it'll say proposed budget i think it says 621 and then the rollback rate what's on the screen up there we found a an error in it and we updated it so i'm just kind of clarifying that that's why i put the copy out there for you after this meeting you give me your projections and then we will uh update it according to the console's desire and then we will prepare an updated budget and give that to you as a as i told you the 1230 or 1 million 233 565 is uh leaving the millage rate as it is no rollback or anything like that as you'll go down uh there are a couple things that i want to highlight last year we were concerned with the pandemic and when we were doing the budget we saw some of the revenues drop now it appears that we weren't hurt as bad as we thought we were going to be hurt and uh so we're bringing our projections up to somewhere at or a little below the prior year uh as an example the utility services tax we're estimating 273 800 which is a 31 000 increase communication service tax at 50. business registration and property rental registration if you look at the 19 and 20 we're collecting 24 000 this year we're right at 60 and we're pretty much done collecting for this year and as you know uh we'll have the second hearing on the budget that that collection will change from january 1st to december 31st as far as the calendar year for the rental registration state revenue sharing half cent sales tax those are all numbers that come from the state last year we had a 50 000 grant from pinellas county of course we don't have that this year we've already completed the project we should have the recycling i don't anticipate unless we have a hurricane any fema reimbursements uh charges for services uh garbage collection 303 000 lot mowing is mainly something that we would have made a lot for where somebody didn't cut the grass lean claims parking permits and then the parking meter feeds for some reason they've drastically increased over the last couple years usually they collected about 75 or 80 000 after the pandemic it's like nobody ever has been to the beach before so that's that we've looked at the number through today actually and uh so we're estimating we're going to bring in about 135 000 in revenue this year which is a good thing it helps with our expenses find some forfeitures that's mainly the parking tickets and that should stay static it has dropped since we don't write parking tickets you know in other areas other than within our city code violation fees that's if we have a code violation so you can't really say i'm gonna charge somebody ten thousand dollars with the code fees you're not gonna do it if you go to the next page our our rentals our interest and investments has dropped dramatically and until they start raising the interest rates and a few things i don't see us gaining a lot on that but the randall uh is starting to come back and i think we're going to be good next year during this year the rest of this year and into next year i think the rental will improve then we go into just miscellaneous revenue and things of that or we do assessment searches when the house sells we get 25 for that so over time we will collect in some years a little more or less but it pretty much remains static uh site plan review that's really a pass-through to the engineer that does our site plans currently we've got six houses under construction in the city so you know there are a few other lots that i know are there are going to be tear downs or that i've been told with this budget we'll end up using about a hundred thousand dollars of our reserve fund right now our estimated reserve after the hurricane the 20 percent that we have to buy state uh is about a little over two million dollars which i think we've been doing good in keeping that reserve at an elevated level even with the stormwater projects and then you'll go down to the expenditures for each department for the most part they're they're pretty static uh and if you look in the back uh round information which is the second section where the details added it'll tell you pretty much uh what percentage of increase it is or is it but overall that increase it's a decrease of 0.81 in that section of the expenditures for the departments the non-departmental would decrease 21 000 and the code enforcement would go up 2600 and that would that's what i'm saying is really a wash for the fact that we would bring the code enforcement in-house and use the executive assistance code enforcement administrator as the code enforcement officer and she currently does most of that work as far as the administration part but code enforcement uh you'll see a big drop there in parks and recreation and that's mainly from the feed for that we expensed last year for the boardwalks when we paid some part of we paid 50 percent of it so uh now if i gave you and we'll talk about what change it might be i just want to quickly talk about changing the uh rollback rate if you go to the rollback rate that would mean we had only collect you've got i've set that at your desktop uh if you go to the rollback rate we would only collect eleven hundred and sixty four thousand dollars and i will detail a little bit later what you might give up or will be giving up with that but i want to at least provide that to you it's a difference of sixty nine thousand dollars okay some of the budgets decisions that we've got to make tonight uh we got to decide on the sheriff's contract what we want to do i had a call with the sheriff on friday or thursday and uh currently this year's budget uh it's going up 3.6 which in right now we have a which i have given you previously the number uh the credit or the contract that we share and i want to make this clear it's two separate contracts bella shore is not part of our contract we just get a credit because they use our deputy okay and i think we need to understand that the fact of the matter is if john the deputy is at 12th street and there's a call in bellar shore guess who's going to that call john our deputy because that's how the system works no different than the fire district no different than the clearwater fire department showing up here because they can get here faster than so you're service wise i don't know that you're gonna see any difference in saying we have one deputy of ourselves uh we're gonna lose the thirty thousand thirty four thousand seven 700 credit if if that's what the council wants to do and that's a decision the consequence to make this far so what that would mean is our contract this year is 503 it would go to 556 771 and we need to go somewhere find that money so there's 34 000 out of your 69 already the consuls talked about things like video and zoom and improving the communications in this room the initial thing that we talked about a couple of weeks ago was 15 000 almost 16 000 we are having the company come back and give us a full blown estimate i'm guessing that that estimate is going to be somewhere in the 30 000 additional because we would do some modifications maybe put some different tvs in and improve it so we could zoom and see people up there that are calling in so i i expect that cost if that's where the council wants to go that's an additional cost so just in those two projects we each have to 69 thousand dollars for the most part one thing i want to update you on i did speak to the mayor beller shore about the gulf boulevard undergrounding money which i told you i was going to do [Music] and it's it's going to stay with us because it has in the past so we will utilize that money to underground the utilities on the whole we had a nice conversation and i uh felt like you know nothing's going on right now so i i was very happy with that conversation and i think there's some other things that i know councilmember banker wants to talk about uh buoys we're out getting prices for that and frank and i have talked about it personally you know between us uh about the requirements and i think that's another thing that we're going to need to go talk about our shore about you know how how that would work and the cost to put them in and who's responsible for them and what the requirements are because uh according to the people that are telling the city uh and i don't know if you've heard any more from that individual you talked to but what they're telling us is some ordinances have to be changed and so you know it's more than just saying we'll do it and we'll i think we can work further on that and some other things that are common building between both cities so let's see one thing that changed a little bit uh which you will have at your next meeting the audit the audit committee met we had two proposals one was for 25 000 and one was for 17 05 which is what we paid last year from our same audit firm the audit committee met and recommended using the same audit firm i will bring that recommendation to console i'll ask tonight do you want the both audit firms to come to the meeting or or not that's that's a question that you know the council i mean at this point seventy five hundred dollars is quite a bit of money for the audit and i don't think the other firm that we've had has done a bad job uh but as we've done with everything we've always went out with the contracts and rebid we only got two proposals so that's that's where that's at uh some of the capital projects uh this sheet on the screens showing you the things that we pretty much save money for each year exterior painting of city hall carpet replacement last year not this current year we did a lot of buoy replacement so we're back to the savings computer hardware the z1 we saved money for the truck john deere tractor so that's stuff that we've been saving money for so we don't have that big expense all at once at one time then we'll go to uh the capital projects uh just to the penny for pinellas money the infrastructure sales tax that we get the gulf boulevard beautification we're going to have to do an amendment on this year's budget because the uh we didn't sign the interlocal agreement with the actual funding until after the budget was already done this year so we're gonna have to do an amendment for about 330 000 for the money for this year and what i'm proposing to do with that is roll it over into next year because i don't see us starting the undergrounding at this point until we've got a good lot of money to move forward with it but next year the combined numbers 9300 423 and we'll get that for three additional years on top of last year so it's a pot of money of about four million dollars and we're still negotiating with uh duke because that's the biggest cost issue at this point and how we're going to do it rather we do it like we did at bellevue estates island where we went out and bid the [Music] conduit and stuff separately and we were the project manager and then we hired someone to help us which was very cost effective for bellevue estates island as opposed to so they are in the process of re uh bringing me a better number than they gave me the first time so and and i expect it to drop significantly some of the facilities uh that you know of course okay the next one other projects the money we save for the roof here with replacement what we talked about earlier the digital sign when you don't see any dollars in the out years what that means is in 22 is the year we're going to do that improvement as an example we're going to do an improvement to the boat ramp we've saved enough money and i think we can move forward with getting that improvement uh the pavement of mormon park morgan park uh it needs to be milled and we'll mill and repay that next year the money for the gulf boulevard beautification i just talked about there is uh some money that i'm going to bring a request at the next council meeting we've got about somewhere around 60 000 left of the previous money that we have to expend before september 30th of this year and we'll finish the west side of bell boulevard with a spectrum we've got two little projects there that are about 52 000 so we won't lose that money we'll use it effectively and go forward there and if you've been out there you see a lot less lines going over the boulevard and in the very near future there won't be any lines going on and if you've driven the city you'll see a lot of holes right now in a lot of places throughout the city where they're putting kind of making connections street resurfacing uh we've always put about 60 000 in we'll look at the pci and see what we can do with that as far as what street paving we need to do next year bridge repairs on both harrison 22nd we didn't put any money in there i think we have a reasonable amount of money for any repairs that we need to make at this point i do still believe we need to save money for the replacement because there's going to be a time when they need replacement uh street light installation we're building a fund there so we can do some upgrades on the street lights eventually get rid of the wood poles possibly put up concrete falls that was the discussion or possibly solar lights if we wait you know some length of time the bridge lighting replacement uh we've been saving some money for that and uh i do think you know we could probably after this year probably limit that to 40 000 and just keep that there but uh and i want to clarify that with fema because if you were here during irma all of our lights stayed up all of the other sides went down and uh i want to try to clarify if we would be reimbursed for that so if we would be reimbursed for it then i don't need to save as much money for it because the only time that we probably have to replace one as an example since irma we've replaced two poles and uh the county has ability to storm so good with that you know we have you know a good relationship with them so uh we may want to just limit that and if it happens then we use the emergency one million dollars we got to set aside so uh but i want some feedback from the council on their thoughts on that city sea walls uh when we do the dock at 7th street we'll look at that seawall and probably do a replacement there why build a dot and then have to modify it one thing i do want to talk about is this area right out here i want to suggest that we talk to an engineer and put a sea wall here because that scouring is getting worse and worse and worse and it's coming up this way more and i think we have enough funding to to make an improvement there and i think that would be an improvement to this area the city where all that rock is dumped if you'll remember in the hurricane we lost pretty much all the vegetation there and the rocks got pulled around and got scoured so so that's a that's an opportunity there then we'll go to the marina we adjusted the parking revenue in there recognizing that the revenue was about twenty thousand dollars so we upped that so what that's going to do is uh increase the revenue that's transferred to the general fund for next year in the past it's been about 40 41 000 next year it's estimated to be 62 000 if we continue to collect parking as it is now the slip rentals went up about ten thousand dollars with the increases that did the uh council approved a few months ago they won't go up next year but they will go up the following year because we've got that set on like a five-year plan where every other year we're going to raise the marina rates utilities insurance and things of that nature are pretty pretty static and then there's a list of uh right now we have four non-residents in the marina out of the country stormwater fund we estimate that we'll collect about 175 000 this year and then we have some personnel expenses that we take from the public works out of there uh the npds numbers uh cost us about ninety six hundred dollars through street sweeping is about seven thousand dollars uh storm during maintenance and things that other maintenance like this year we re-graded this retention pond in the back so the flow would be better cleaned out the swale across the street along the edge of the park and that produced a better flow for when it and there's 30 000 in there on that page if you look at it and we don't know if that's going to be required or not it depends if the governor signs the bill house bill 53 which today hasn't been signed um oh i'm sorry uh what i was saying is that there's 30 000 in the stormwater or a mandate it's a bill house bill 53 that we've still got what 10 days left the side of the governor's side but that's going to what that's going to create is the requirement to do a needs analysis for the infrastructure in the city for the next 20 years and submitted to the state that was something that came in so i think that concludes everything that i have as far as this goes uh so i guess questions from the council i did give you a sheet that shows the highest and lowest expenses of revenue [Music] as far as what our biggest revenue is of course is actually in taxes the collection for the trash collection and then i gave you a sheet that talks about the expenses and what our highest expenses are and for the most part it's contractual services and you'll see that sheet across the top law enforcement is the biggest of it which is 532 000 that's got a ten thousand dollar supplemental uh patrol that we've been doing this year where we put out patrols on holidays and special days [Music] and of course garbage and trash utilities professional services insurance and legal fees i'd say those are the top six or seven items that are our expenses the stormwater project for next year is uh 17th and 18th street and we've already put a box on 18th street in staff did that which saved us several thousand dollars of having a contractor do it so we've got a little bit of head start 12th and 13th is under design and permitting currently and that's a project that hopefully we'll get out to bid here in the next month or so i mentioned the reserves are a little over 2 2 million dollars uh twenty percent of it uh we have to keep it reserved which is about five hundred and forty five thousand dollars hurricane's a million dollars and that leaves us a reserve of about 2 million 66 so i think our reserve burn rate has to slow and i will mention again that eventually we're going to get some money from the federal government that we'll have to decide where we're going to use that which it looks like we can use it for homework but we haven't been given a date or time or anything at this point we've just filled out forms so questions you said we only have four non-residents we only have four non-residents in the green currently they pay the same as residents no they pay a higher fee uh let's see i think it went for them to uh i want to say residents are paying like eight dollars a foot and non-residents are paying like yeah 12. significantly more but the plan was to raise the resident and raise the non-resident eventually to 15 and that's over a five-year period you know there's a lot of residents that would like to get in that brain if they can definitely push on your residents now it shouldn't be about shooting cities are there is a resident list which you know one of them leads [Music] seriously congratulations okay but um i think this council needs to we could probably spend a work session on the night just on that um you know i like kyle i've had some dealings with him i think he said yeah and you may be the next person in line but i think that's something that we all need to discuss here and come up with some type of a decision as to you know when you decide that you wish to go watch the cardinals play you know america's team say here i look they're my favorite but but when um you know when you decide to do that we need to kind of have our our idea here as to where the council wants to go because part of the thing we talked about with charter review was calling a city manager's position called an administrator position you know and there may be differences when you go out to actually look for someone on the outside in terms of what you have to pay and things like that so um charter says city manager so you can't without a vote of the citizens you can't change it to administrator so but all i'm trying to do is uh put in place for a few thousand dollars to help to put kyle more involved in the day-to-day operations bringing to the council meetings uh getting more up-to-date because when i do decide to retire which i haven't made a decision at this point but i think regardless you need a person that will be here to help the transition and that's that's where i'm proposing i'm not proposing that you know if he applies for the job that's up to him but that's not for me you say um with regard to your comments on the sheriff and bring the code officers i do and i've had some discussions on this i think that's a topic for this council and i think that's a topic that i want dan daugherty to be here for um i want to hear his side okay it's easy for you to say things up here i've heard other things um i want to get it all out okay i want to hear what the detail is i want to hear how this experience has i want all been here information out so that we and this community can make a smart decision as to what we have to do one of the reasons we brought dan on board was because we weren't getting coverage on the weekend um and now we're talking about having a person during the weekday well that's great and then the residents you know the bad ones that want to cause problems do all their bad stuff on weekends we've had that issue before so um i think that that should be scheduled [Music] and if you read the contract sheriff's contract the deputy on duty is supposed that doesn't exactly work out so right so um anyway i'm going to ask that if we put on the next council session if you want that decision from this council to make that change then let's have i'll call it like a hearing it's not a hearing but it's i want that i want that we didn't have a work session that's not a problem um yeah oh yeah that's fine we can do this work session we'll do the regular counseling session what's ever easier dana when i came here we were about hundred thousand dollars a year that we were going after the piggy bank to have our capital projects and you just announced that if this budget stays the same we're talking about a hundred thousand dollars so that's all that counts as last two councils here and the improvement that we've made we're not hitting that piggy bank and two million dollars in the bank got a pretty big piggy bank that if we do have to tap it for capital we're gonna be in good shape so that was that was a new budget extending um the underground i'm not gonna get into any comments because of my personal situation but um i'm glad what mayor schmidt said and i hope that that's correct um councilmember bloom said something otherwise at one of their council meetings okay and of late councilmember bloom seems seems to get what he wants there so before we get before i would just like to see how their council focus on that i hope that it is the way mayor schmidt said that we continue to do it if we continue to do it my question to you is never asked this initially what's our arrangement with across the street we have an interlocal agreement and liability waivers for the work that we're supervising and doing well it's the county interactive agreement we don't have anything because all the work for the most part is done in the county right away okay so it's an enrollment agreement that says that in all the utilities that have to get that they have to get uh runaway permits to work there so you know they're providing insurance and things of that nature but it's tougher through accounting or local right that thanks for the question um the insurance you mentioned that insurance is staff i've talked to like five people this week who have homeowner's bills that are just going through the roof i took to a state representative last week who was doing legislation because insurance is going through now i know that's homeowners but you haven't seen that at all with the city minimalistic when i say static what i mean is there's going to be some increase if you get into the detail as an example i put two or three percent in for health insurance okay because that that's probably one of our biggest insurance costs uh actually that probably costs more than i believe properly and uh what i've done over the past couple years is if if they come in with some exorbitant number then i you know i have to talk to the employees of course but i tell them hey this is the numbers i have and this is all i can expend so we may have to change a plan i'm talking about liability and particularly coverage and flood coverage that has been i mean we're talking 20 plus percent for average homeowners uh our flood insurance because we just we actually we just paid the flood insurance for the next world war i think it only went up a couple hundred dollars it wasn't much blood insurance for uh cedar this year was like uh 6 800 and i've got budgeted at 7 500. so i you know this building a little different our flood insurance was about 2 800 and i've got budgeted 3 000. i don't anticipate because this building is is elevated uh general liability and property windstorm those combined are about forty four thousand dollars and uh that well that's what we've got budgeted this year they're at forty so we went up about four thousand dollars and unfortunately we're building this budget on stuff that we don't have yet because they're they haven't given to us now the flood insurance i know because we just paid it you know for our year goes from like may something i forget what it was but within the last month we paid it so that number i know is is good for at least another 12 months it was about 6700 but i i can get you the exact numbers for that property right now 250 max [Music] right what's the context well the contents uh on top of that there's there's a lot of equipment in there it's more than a house but i can get you that if you want to know what that is well we shopped in a couple years ago uh with what we were paying from uh was weston uh that insurer was number was much higher than what i got it for using phoenix no are we getting fired yeah yeah and i'm going to ask i just went through this i just went through this with three people including myself my house was newer than this building um i mean they're talking about not even doing coverage for certain people if your roof is older than four years which is absurd okay but that's what these some of the uh yeah yeah well okay i don't have a sugar roof need to be you but they're still acting kind of silly so i'm just going to tell you i mean do whatever you want to do but i strongly suggest you make a phone call for the agent and find out what they have on their sleeve that we may not find out about because you may have sticker shock you know six months from now and we've already passed the budget unless they're for some reason taking care of government entities better than they are households this is like a crisis in florida right now i mean the legislature was actually putting you know efforts to try to bring this stuff in a lot of it's due to people making improper claims and things so i i just suggest you might want to make that phone call and find out what they have coming down the pike for you i hope you come back and tell me it's going to be five percent that's great yeah you know it's it's uh well the flood insurance we locked that right in for three years so next year would be the third year i can tell you honestly if i did that because it was an option that they gave me at the time which was cheaper than the company from south florida you know as far as municipality and liability insurance it's pretty much went you know four or five percent higher you know it's it's a long run so and if if the flood insurance we may have to shopping again and look at what we're covering but i can't find i'll i'll get you that invoice frankly councilman questions comments opened up to the citizens there's no questions okay mr reeves so then you pretty much have went through this tonight you have have we answered what you need to have answered to move forward here well one thing you haven't answered is what do we want to do with the share i kind of need that answer because they're going to come with a contract here and if we're going to you know is it this council's wish to increase it because i i did hear that the concern that we were paying for next door well i i think that at this point is not totally correct because they it wouldn't matter where the deputies at they would come whether it's whoever's closest is going to go there just like the fire department or the ambulance or whoever it is [Music] so uh in the conversation i had with the sheriff uh i will tell you he said why don't you start your own police department and i kind of laughed and i said well that's probably 1.1 million at least and he said you're right or go somewhere else was i think he's frustrated with you know some of the comments that have been made and i understand his frustrations but i i think we need to decide because what happens if uh bellar shore says i i don't want to give them that credit anymore are you willing to eat 35 000. that's the question right now for council comments if they if they did that would they have to establish their own resources no so we can still use our pen the way the sheriff and the fire district and the ambulance all work is if not not to control the beach or something like that but if there's a call whoever's the closest is going it's just like for us if there's a call and they need backup guess where the deputy comes from he comes from belar gloves he comes from indian rocks beach this is that's the sheriff's deputy dude and and i know that all of us have seen we'll say an accident in the street on belt boulevard did you see one sheriff carter no you saw several so you know i'd like to be able to go back to the sheriff and say you know unless the council tells me differently no we want to keep this credit we don't want to get this 35 000 increase if we can keep it but that may not be our choice but i want to know what the concept's feedback looks like well my question is you're supposed to get 15 minutes of i can understand there's arriving or something like that they all respond all right but it's a half an hour a day or something new coverage about our shoes no it's about an hour and a half today if you if you calculate if you want to calculate it that way but i think you have to calculate it on the crime rate which there's little or none here i think you have to calculate it on the calls for service which is uh we're about 95 of the calls for service they're four percent and you know i gave statistics on if you went by the crime our credit would be much lower uh so i think you know in looking at the bigger picture the question the council's got to answer do we have a crime problem here with what we're doing now we'll hear there's never sure okay but that's my point you know yeah but my point is is it am i being given false information that it's 15 it's not 15 minutes a shift it was calculated in like 45 minutes to shift okay so it's an hour and a half that's right again right and if i uh i asked the deputy one time about that and he told me to close all three gates it takes about 10 minutes drive close the gate close the gate close the gate 10 minutes open the gate open the gate open again if they do a beach patrol that might take them 15 or 20 minutes they do little or no house checks which is a theory that some people here think they do a ton of house checks over there they don't do any based on what the daytime deputies have told me uh so the really only service that they're getting is the deputies patrolling their parking lot which he drives by and if he sees a car in there that you know what the daytime deputy told me is he sees a car in there that isn't a regular that he already knows then he goes in there but if he does and he doesn't drive in the parking lot uh and and i can do the same thing you know because because i know the people that go there on a regular basis that drive their car so i can drive down the street and say oh well that's so-and-so's car um so i i think we have to look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is do we have a problem with the sheriff and the crime and what we're getting from the sheriff and i don't think we do and and you all the council members at every council meeting when the sheriff comes what comes what what is said to the sheriff ah great job yeah you guys are doing a great job you know this is this is not a new issue this goes back to two or three councils and this issue has been raised before the issue is that i'm the numbers guy the manhole accounting isn't there so the only way you can figure it out is you kind of got to do a thought experiment sat down and tried to kind of brainstorm what are those things that the deputy does in the various places during your shift and the numbers just coming out the bottom line is going to be some months we're the winner someone's uh [Music] [Music] ultimately we don't have the final decision on that now do we because if better short is called tomorrow said hey we're done we're going to do something else something different then we are about to increase anyway or not correct i mean we don't have the choice to say we're not well they are with the sheriff but you know i i will tell you i had a conversation with the sheriff about that and um i i would you know probably make a phone call to their mayor and say hey you know this we don't have crime here why are we you know i probably try to uh say it's working why do we need to change it and uh you know it's kind of like i went and made the call to the to the mayor about the gold boulevard money and explained the situation and he totally said that we've always done it this way and and constantly is aware of that and i you know mayor i don't have privy to what conversation you said mr bloom said but um town council okay okay well uh maybe that conversation needs to be had with mr bloom too and i don't have a problem doing that because i the the best benefit for the gulf boulevard money is for both of us get rid of the power lines improve the thing and that's what the money is supposed to be used for and in my estimation it's the same with the sheriff that's the best benefit the sheriff gives us you know sergeants and corporals and all kinds of backup information backup police force uh the guy that you know whatever happened to him and fell off his bicycle on the bridge i mean they closed the bridge for i don't know an hour or so i don't know if you even knew about that but that happened here in the last couple weeks and uh it wasn't but it wasn't a car hitting anybody it was a guy that fell off his bicycle for whatever reason and i don't know what the outcome of that is today i know he was injured severely but they had the police they had the resources and anything something like that happens they have the resources they're not coming here with one deputy they're coming here but in most cases two three sometimes even more now so you know i i just feel like maybe we should be talking to bellar shore and saying hey we want to keep this the way it is and it's not our contract they have their own contract and the sheriff could do something else and and i know he was going to talk to them about that but my recommendation is leave him alone you know our sheriff's contract isn't up until october isn't it september uh yeah yeah okay so this is not up it's not a provoke tonight because the budget's going to have to be adjusted because right now the budget is 34 000 short based on the the credit that's the possibility because i i put it in there as what the sheriff sent me which i've provided you with a copy of i'm talking about this talk too much you can sit down in your seat that's true june vancouver 7th street beach um bella shore's last council meeting they said there would be no increase for the sheriff cost so are we absorbing that cost that's my question to this council so even if we stay with them in this situation insulting that cost if we have to take an increase i believe they should take their part of the increase it's it's it's on the right [Music] thank you thank you citizens right back to council mayor i i would expect that uh based on how the sheriff calculates their numbers because of how it's done currently is by population right so uh and i will confirm that with the sheriff but uh the population numbers for us have increased if we're like 1625 so i don't maybe their population isn't as high and it adjusted but i'll clarify that because they should get based on population they should the sheriff's contract throughout i don't care if it's indian rocks or bluffs it gives you that percentage of increase that's what it is for everybody so they don't get any uh but it could be that their population and then you put our 1625 in it for last year i think it was it was a 1566 petty something like that so we've had an increase in population so maybe our share is a little bit more but so that might not be a correct comment or to understand there might be slight because if the sheriff's price is going three percent just cost a living basically they might see that but then we may have a little difference in population maybe we have a bigger population gain that's what we're basically well we do have a prior year and maybe theirs is down i think last year's if i remember right their population last year was like 109 and ours was 15 66 i think i may be off you know one or two heads but i guess we could go over and count but no i don't think so do we have a cost per hour from charge you you got the uh how how it's based it's based on a deputy and and i gave you uh gosh probably a couple weeks ago the sheet from the sheriff and what one deputy costs cost per deputy is 103 575 dollars and our deputies have a post of four times 1.2 with the relief factor so you know you can probably put that in a cost per hour if you divide the hundred thousand i'm guessing it's probably somewhere around 50 bucks an hour give or take i was i was i was sleeping around 49 so that's probably pretty close so um that comes after like 21 000 for the hour and a half a week eight day times eight times seven times and then we're getting what thirty nine thousand thirty four three four thousand so then there's another twelve thousand thirteen thousand dollars in miscellaneous yeah yeah because the way the sheriff allocates it every city pays the same for the number of deputies they have and for us dummies have 39 figures that's probably pretty close i'm just doing a rough calculation no that's that's probably pretty close uh i think danny's costing us about 48 an hour right now three percent buck and a half so it's maybe 49.50 next year i but i think that the council has to kind of give me some feedback on where we want to go with this and i think i need to relay to the sheriff hey we're fine leaning as it is or not if the council doesn't again i'm going to stress that this is a determination that comes up when we ratify the contract we've already ratified it through september if you want to take a poll where the council stands i have no problem with that well that's what's going to be finding on september it's not so we can't break our own rules here no no i'm just asking for what the council's direction is that's fine so if the sheriff comes back and tells me uh do you want the the credit because feller shore is willing to continue that uh is the council okay with that because if you're not then i need to tell the sheriff no we're not we want we're going to pay the 34 000 so in a nutshell are we still good as a council with a sharing arrangement with bellairy shore this year it's approximately 34 and i go up or down slightly based on population or allocation it's not going to change drastically if the answer is no that needs to go back and say we're not good with that and then we'll have to increase the budget right 35 000. if we say yes then it may change slightly but we don't have much more of a discussion than others sorry no issues whatsoever with the current situation the only thing that i would recommend is since it's possible that those things may change whenever the contract comes up we maybe need to pad a little bit in the budget just to compensate for the difference in case we lose that well i'm hoping before we pass them well i will know that before we pass our final budget in september so i'll have to adjust it by that but at this point i you know if we're fortunate and keep the situation that it's good good for us i think i've been very satisfied with the services we received from pinellas county i agree with everything of us [Music] yes yes i'm just still confused on our deputy ghost still better do business and then they're saying that possibly we will not get that credit if we raise these issues now who's going to where is the money going from bel air to provide that that stellar shores has to make a payment is what i'm saying something's not connected in my head and i apologize for my stupidity well what would happen there's there's a couple options i guess that could that let me finish me i think i'm being held hostage okay by saying well if you don't agree or we're not going to give you the money well who's going to pay for the share from balor shores they are okay so they're going to use whose deputy well that's that's what's can be debatable as an example if we said we don't want to have the arrangement we have today and i'm not saying that bellar gloves or indian rocks or anybody would would they still have to pay yes okay so what i'm saying is that they use irb or sand key or whatever then they still have to pay yes okay so does the depth does the sheriff's department have any latitude on saying what deputy you're going to use they have a system just like the fire and everybody else approached first to the thing that's the point i'm trying to make they're not going to say well okay you're not going to use bell or at least we're not going to use treasure on it i mean it would be ridiculous you have to use the closest deputy that's right so i don't think we i'm not getting hog-tied here's what i'm saying all right they're going to have to use baller beach you might be and we would get the credit regardless no no the way i understand it is for routine patrol purposes if it goes in on speech or better they're going to come up five minutes to drive up from the rocks gauge and do their normal control and then turn around and go back but in a case where they've got an emergency call a 9-1-1 call or some break-in or something it's going to be no he can't not if it's not part of the thing he could he'd have to use either another you know i mean i can't say that it would be indian rocks or someone else that has the sheriff we're surrounded by him so that could happen right and technically if you wrong speech and bel air plus doesn't agree to it they may be in worse shape and have to pay three times as much to get one person throughout the day so i no and you know the sheriff told me he had two or three options he had an option to talk to indian rocks he had options to talk to bellar gloves he had an option to he called the county car i don't know what that means he didn't really explain it to me or he has the the option to do what we're doing but that's going to be determined by you know the situation but in the end i don't think it really matters one way or the other it's if someone needs service you don't want them denied the service whether it's there or somewhere else i'm for the current situation i'm satisfied with the service i think for budgetary planning purposes we need to figure that into the budget that credit so that's why i think some sort of consensus is moving forward just for the commercial planning purposes obviously when the contract comes here contract approval is a separate thing right now we have five people who are in favor of it i'm not going to express any opinion either way um until i see final numbers frank or against doesn't matter it really doesn't i [Music] okay so so you have five people so you can tell the sheriff at this point that you have a consensus of the council for the cost sharing and i think everybody is going to have a look at this come september to make sure that that cost has been equally and properly shared that's where right now it's done by population that's fine so okay anybody else have any other questions on the budget before we close it i had just one yesterday we talked about the bridge light replacement and you know i've had side wars on this and i think you're trying to start a to craft foreign sort of policies so that we've got this million dollars hitting in a hurricane point and it's an awful lot of money sitting there and maybe for a big storm moving through knocking down lights rather than having 30 or 40 000 sitting in reserve earmarked for greek's lights maybe if you have a storm you lose lights it's a one-time justifiable expense i pulled it out of the hurricane fund we changed the policy so we can do that with a payment repayment schedule of maybe one to two budget cycles and it's all back in here maybe rather than have money sitting there in reserves it's already sitting there hurricane it's not necessarily about the budget but actually the media that it's being distributed on i did get a little bit confused uh when comparing the handouts to what you gave me some of them looked like they were newer there was a couple updates maybe some of them were older uh everything matched in um maybe as you're making changes you create a new revision and that's that's in the footer you publish it so that every time we get one of these even if it's in a pdf format we know which one we're looking at yeah well what what what i was trying to get out of tonight is your feedback now you're going to get another and i'm going to tell you to toss what you got because i'm going to do some you know a couple modifications uh and uh then you'll get a cleaner copy it'll have page numbers on it but this is this is like the uh what do you want to call it the first draft to see what the console's feedback and anything they want to change do you want me to put money in there as an example that's another question or the the videos system audio video do you want me to put money in there uh i i hopefully uh we're meeting with the gentleman on june 29th so hopefully we'll have some better numbers shortly after that uh and at the next budget session if he gives me a number i'll put it in there and then you can tell me take it out or leave it alone and the the thing with the street lights maybe we repurpose that money you know that's fine uh i will make a couple phone calls to see if they they got reimbursed by fema because sometimes some of those things aren't reimbursable because all their lights were gone anything else okay thank you in residents bullet point insights on future budgetary impacts and sunshine implications i don't see a name here so i'm going to assume it's the city manager put this on is that correct actually it was me okay so from now on i've asked this only about 25 times i don't know who makes these motions if you don't see it so this should say motion by gun or item by done okay go ahead yeah the only question i had on this thing was monetary damage in the future couldn't  our city because we're talking about budget and if there's a budgetary impact i just was wondering what the insights were on that and whether or not i guess [Music] going forward there was a resolution passed that was resolved i think the record speaks for itself and my thoughts on that well i mean i was at that video so i'm just asking okay so then could you just go back to the firefighter well i think the record on june 7th that you have that you can get a copy of clearly i want to say something now that this the resolution has been passed it's been adopted it's closed business um i would like to uh add to what you're saying right now it's apparently it's not because this was sent out to all council members after that meeting so it was not resolved otherwise you wouldn't have written that so i think mr gunn has a very valid point do you know something that the rest of us don't know hang on a second i'm going to jump into this first off this isn't a court of law he's not under deposition or subpoena if he wishes to speak about it by all means speak mr banker if you don't and you want to refer to the record that's fine as for what you write afterward we kind of lose sight of this a lot in this city you don't lose your first amendment rights to right when you leave this building you can disagree with resolutions we had a council member that was six to one disagree with a bridge thing went all the way to nick disickly and got stuff done so listen if you want to write a letter you're by the letter there is an issue here that i think mr gunn wants to speak about with potential sunshine which has to be talked about briefly but if you don't want to talk about it that's it don't be forced into doing anything no one here is going to force it mr chairman yes let's let's clear the record right off the get going i had a conversation with the secretary about this we talked about almost for 20 minutes about the email okay at the end of the 20 minutes our attorney had to go to another conference it was the wrong email that we were discussing all right it wasn't until he sent me the email which i didn't even know went to all you council members i'm not on there well when i s when i was when i sent my reply back it was to two people two constituents that wrote to me okay i don't know how i'm going to excuse me well i'm not excused because i don't have one i don't have with anybody except there's two people right so now i don't know how but the record speaks for itself the resolution was closed it was i have a copy of the resolution here i can pull it up on my computer i'm sure but it says immediately upon the boat that you would sign so it's over it's done the business is old business it wasn't being resurrected are you either one of you guys proposed to rescind the resolution yeah first first off some say sunshine locations you're putting words in there i i'm not but you should be worried that i'm not well i don't believe i violated it sometimes well i've never heard over there insights on future budgetary impact unforeseen monetary damage of the future good for varsity at a matter about this the city clerk hasn't paid and she can play back through the events and it's crystal clear it is on the website i think there is two issues with this i think the first issue which is battle of the sunshine implication which you know as soon as i saw that i was like sunshine you know and i just attributed to him being newer and not baby is aware it's very easy to reply all because every time i reply i'm so scared about doing that i like triple check to make sure it's only getting to one the second part of this that glenn brings up i think is kind of passive aggressive here i think i don't know to me this your email response seemed a little passive-aggressive and snarky grenade is driven so tone is different but in your reply to vice mayor it seemed a little passive aggressive because you know i also voted against the resolution i still don't agree with the resolution but it's passed it's over and i'm ready to pull up my big real panties and move on like we all should which we have trouble doing often um but and i think personally glenn i think and what i i you did it before me the email response i would have maybe sent something to patty or to fred and said hey you know just maybe refresh frank's memory about the sunshine law and when it's okay to do email in case he doesn't know to me this seems passive aggressive and i feel like we're tattling and we're getting principal involved or something so what was my exact response he knew it was awesome i think it was to the city clerk and the superman i said i'm concerned about the sunshine implications that was it yes but this was forwarded to everybody my question again is the unforeseen monetary let's talk a second about sunshine i'm going to ask the city attorney if there's anything i said that's incorrect here because um this you know the way sunshine is banned about this city the legislators are turning over in their graves okay it is not i'm reading from the sunshine manual okay the attorneys general attorney general's office stated it is not a direct violation of the sunshine law for members to circulate their own written position papers on the same subject as long as the board members avoid any discussion or debate amongst themselves except at open public meeting his practice is strongly occur discouraged that's attorney general's order 07-35 see also hg01-21 you didn't break the symbol okay as far as i'm concerned and i'm sure the city of i'll be finished and then you can come so it's discouraged if somebody responds to this publicly that's when the sunshine thing gets triggered because now there's a discussion going back and forth glenn and uh and dave and i went to emo one that was covered in detail they went to emote too i don't know if they had a refresher on it but certainly that's been apparently the city's position also that's the way i learned it so you get what they call the first bite at the apple you took it you can do it as far as i'm concerned you're gonna do one thing wrong so the city attorney has a different view i'd love to hear it but um you know that there's nothing wrong with what you did it's not it probably shouldn't be done regularly but i don't think i did anything wrong either because i i didn't know it said to everybody but b i want to thank mr john for bringing to in terms of this discussion with regard to sunshine quality advice any suggestions or anything else i'll have suggestions the suggestion is that as i understand it it was an inadvertent unintentional response to all city council members that i i'm you'll probably get tired of me saying stuff like this i'm always going to say it be in the position of being in the safe harbor not in the position of splitting ears and a lot of times people want to try and split ears and that means you're barely on one side of the line the far better thing is to be clearly on one side of the line and obviously we'll be in the same the same forward the thing that it gets tedious of me to do it but i do it every time that i write an email to y'all i at the end of it saying to to ensure compliance with the sunshine law please do not respond to this with an email text if you have a question please call me directly i do that every time i've done it for years i think i say the same thing every time but i do that because it's a mental step that i need to take and i would encourage you all to do the same thing i'll go away from this situation to a different one that has is evolving and it's getting people into trouble all over the state and that is social media somebody posts a uh they're friends with each other council members on facebook and somebody makes a comment about something related to city business and then somebody else who's on the commission or the council responds to it in some way even as simple as a thumbs up and that's gotten people in in trouble and you know it's it's a fine line but you know my advice to to y'all is don't make it a fine line be clearly in the safe harbor and you know you're you're new to government and it's you know it's something you have to learn from talking to you it was clear to me um there was no ill intent there was no motivation to violate the law in fact you were very concerned about making sure this is something you should dwell on i think it's something you brought up member guns brought it up it's been discussed and you you should move on that's my opinion i'd like to make one more and then i'll try basically i'm i'm going to first say the reason why i consider this an ongoing conversation directed at us is you were not very happy whenever whenever the meeting was over where that that one agenda was complete so um see this email the next day it looks like you're harping on us automatically i came to conclusion that's my fault that's on me all right i'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and and uh accept that you made a mistake it was an accident and and and just walk away from it well what i'm saying is it was a mistake that it went to all the council members right was i happy about the resolution no i'm still not happy about it but it's over that's what a resolution is and you move on and and so you know i mean the rules of order paul that once an item is and we get debated i mean we're not going to debate something that we did before but we certainly talk about stuff that happened before prior meetings so this discussion is appropriate once something is voted on we don't discuss it again in that sentence or again or at the end of the night but it's wrap up but if you want to go out the next day or anyone wants to go out the next day and hold a press conference and say gee the council was way off you have that right you have every right in the world no one here is going to stop you and if they do they're going to get the city into a major problem so you have first amendment right to say what you want you're not the only person who's not happy with that resolution and i'll leave it at that so what else we have anything else i just wanted to make a comment as well i don't think that i understand what you said city attorney rally but i don't think that we're the proper [Music] make any determination on comments well there's a procedure in florida law if somebody wants to make a complaint to the commission on ethics and they can do that not to get off into another topic but i will say it only in passing the reason i sent you the memo i sent today to the city council members about the application of a floor of our rule is because i want you to understand the council members to understand the role that i play in this i'm i'm not supposed to take the ball and then it's not my role to prosecute anybody it's my role to do what i put or what i highlighted in that rule and that's exactly what i've done so if somebody here is so agreed by that uh what has happened and now that you have an explanation that it was an important thing yet they still want to make a ethics complaint that then they they can do that that's up to them citizens no comments okay um yeah go ahead uh one question do you want consensus of the council the audit committee did not bring the groups in they [Music] you did ask that question does anybody else have anything else that closes it lynn the audit committee um i'll try to maybe cut through this real quickly it has always been our position to bring the top ranked people in for a presentation i think that they took the time to make a bid even though they might be in second place maybe they could explain why their services are worth more than the other people we only have two it's not going to take that long one is the incumbent we were going to do that with we did that with the city attorney who picked the top three um and had mr mourinho bid he would have automatically got to the final so he said so basically why not that's my opinion if anybody else can't spare 15 minutes we'll get together uh so i appreciate it as chair of the auto committee i think it's a waste of time honestly to bring the two groups in we've read the professional uh well done proposals we thought it was pretty far apart between the two the incumbent march uh more professional and fully completed proposal together so i just after some of these discussions i've seen how also this discussion i think just from the efficiency of the meeting perspective i'd recommend um as a chair of the audit committee that they're they don't come to do a presentation so that's just in does that change our opinion does it change your mind did you get a question no they're trying to get business they better not charge us what would you expect to hear they would change your mind or change it well i think back to when the night fled riley came in and you know if you were a betting person there were some pretty heavy law firms that came in and if you were going to bet the favor was probably not no offense to friend not fred riley okay and fred came here he did a great presentation and his credentials were excellent and he was remembered that night okay so um i i respect what they did and we're probably going to vote just the way they did but they put a lot of effort into it if they if they want to come in if they don't want to come in that's fine too i just think we owe that much it's only two people so that's all the market we're familiar with but i think it's a courtesy more you know i don't mind another 15 minutes that's all we're going to give him like 10 15 minutes of presentation yeah we would yeah we'd do it at the beginning of a council meeting and then i'd ask for you know selection and then we go ahead because because they will start the audience sometime in august so we're on we're on a good timeline that's what i'm telling i'll contact both of them and i will pass on the rankings absolutely and you know it may be that um does not have to come they know what the recommendation is right but so what we want to do is put something on the consulate for july 6 to move over to the execution of the contract with whoever the city give them the option because it's not afraid of completing that just because again account because the committee recommended it we're each going to make our own decisions after analysis would i do it if i was hopeful yeah i'd come here and say any questions i'm taking the time to come here i'd love to continue as your auditor that's what i would do but yeah now i'm just mentioning to you i'm hearing a lot of things on this july meeting that's the anniversary of our seven hour meeting like last year yeah just keep an eye on what you're putting on our table here see if you can beat it [Music] money for uh because we have to expand it before september for the verizon our spectrum too many things in my head right now and then i think there's just a couple other things i don't think we've done any other ordinances we're going to probably try to do a work session on the sign ordinance at some point and uh maybe if you want the code person you can work that in but so what i would suggest is we think about a couple things in july okay um maybe it's the second monday and then you get the third monday we'll have three meetings in july that's okay we had a couple months where we have nothing so that's one meeting so right now we have july 6 at 19 on the books and we may be adding another one so we would be probably if we kept it on monday it would be july 12th is that right yes okay but that would be probably the sign ordinance and well let's we have given for a time on that i'm not i'm not gonna because we can move it to a different day too so we can we still have enough notice time patty if we uh announce it at the council meeting yeah yes so we'll see where this act with our overall development because remember we have quite a bit of stuff on that so yeah that's fine um um okay any other council comments general business running for a couple of um we last time we we keep doing this and i don't really think it's appropriate we keep putting the minutes in the consent agenda and we normally have moved them when there was an issue out of the consent agenda except last time we didn't do that so buried in our minutes i think is a vote that got completely buried in terms of the dissenting vote it's not specified immediate that's what i wanted to object on last time i have jack but getting corrected i'm calling voice votes but i'm not going to call them this is optional to me if we're going to bury the vote i've always been of the impression that you own your vote so we put it in the record i really think that we should put they're not it's not a consent agenda consent agenda is for ministerial stuff that doesn't require discussion it's national earth month we all agree we're going to celebrate it wonderful we put it in the consent agenda because we don't need to set this up but when you're doing the minutes there's almost always some kind of question and if there's not it takes like 10 seconds to say anybody have any problems and you blow through it and we approve it but if we're going to start having incomplete minutes not showing reflecting the full votes then i'm going to call voice code and not a crystal i'm going to call a roll vote for everything because that's optional and it takes a little longer so be it so the simple solution is just move the approval of minutes out of the consent agenda into the regular [Music] it open i got spies they told me i haven't put my kayak in the water yet but i've been too busy the program's not open when's it gonna be open we'll get it open this week we had fish detail last week i understand that and i appreciate that clean up good job okay last the city submerged land thing fred issued us a memo today lesbian you might have just got it it looks like the end of the day um i think this may need some more i have legal issues with this in terms of what happens when you fill in other people's land and who owns the dirt and homes you know we know wheel in the water it gets to a complicated real estate issue so if that's going to come back up before us i think we need to hash some stuff out how's the best way to do it i don't know i asked lynn when i was here the other day i said maybe i can sit down with him and go through the maps and see what we're talking about here but um i mean i have more questions than i have answers at this point although i think fred did resolve the one issue with regard to the charter so but you can come in and i can show you what i'm talking about because the the line like i said it weaves like it that first section it's it's wider down through probably second or third street and then it goes back into the seawall and then it comes out again a couple other places so if you click on the map on the property approaches map you can see where the property lines are lined up and the submerged lands is when you click on the property outside of their property it says it's owned by the city of our budget and it's called submerged lands well in the research i did when mrs lovinda they did hers we found that somewhere in the 60s or 70s they you know i don't recognize they'll have to probably do something to find it but the state there's a land organization that gave that to the city because the city was better equipped to control the filling of the lands and probably most of this you know i don't know when their sea walls were put in but in the 60s and 70s they're probably were sea walls there it was probably just rocks or dirt or you know so johnny comes along oh well you know i need to push a little dirt in here because my um backyard don't we do this let me meet with you and then maybe we'll get whatever whatever questions i have that you can't answer i think it's going to get into some legal stuff and then you as the city representative can determine if you want to refer that to mr riley they're not simple like question many plans are off the top of his head we're going to get into like what happens in this strange situation when you do this and it's probably not the first time it's happened in the state of florida but i don't know the law on it i've never you know it doesn't normally happen but i'm sure it's not the first time so let me see that what is your schedule like in the next week or so yeah i'll give you a call mr chairman i want to throw that easement issue now if it's orlando they've already built can't we sell them the land at a dollar a square foot um it's not a lot of money those people didn't do anything wrong in my opinion they've inherited a mess why drag this out god forbid some some one of their guests drowns in their pool that he won the city property are we liable awesome yeah to your point um one of the people again this is all new to me too one of the people came up after the meeting last week and said to me there's condos that this has been happening at because they're selling on the land now i don't know if they're selling it at arm's length or if they're selling it like you say at a dollar a square foot or something well we would get the tax revenue back we would make it out on this the only problem is if we start getting into selling land anything we're selling city land that's the chariot question that i have for mr riley he's going to answer that under the affirmative that has to go to voters to actually sell city land so that's where we have a situation here and i'm not you know when you go to first street if you look at this house as it did they got a wall that goes right there well that that wall actually extends into what would have been our water and their dock is in what would be our water so you can't access it as a citizen but i'm saying well okay if you take that piece of that wall down you have an extension of first street park i'm not saying that's what we should do okay i feel sorry too but we need to square this thing away somebody's still in our land you know and i mean it's uh i understand it but he said these residents bought this you know and i would like to see just this cleaned up as fast as possible at the least expensive i just want to make sure we do it right because if we give away charter plans we all can say goodbye to being on council in this land it would be like florida communities trust land i mean yes i can't sell it either you can't sell it right that's all i believe under the constitution you can sell some type of uh land to the state owned like this would have to go to the voters and through this when we were going to take a look at every park in the city because we did an analysis to say is there anything we can do with them besides just have people put their dogs there and um we looked at it and most of these things are very restricted and i think this was one of them because we asked about this and lynn checked it for us and it's yeah florida gave it to us but it's like we're giving it to you but if you do anything with it then it's ours to us it goes back to florida so it's not even ours i'm just saying my heart is after those people yeah but i think we want to solve it i think we want to work with them that's my position but i want to do this right okay and i don't know that the encroachment easement is the right way to go so i'm volunteering my time which is fairly expensive as an attorney just sit down with you um and i will come up with the stuff and i will lay it out you always want me to go through you to go to france so i will go through this with i need your knowledge because you have a historical background that i don't have for this and i can tell you the questions i want to have and then you know fred can probably give us maybe the right way to go so that we stay compliant with the charter i have no problem selling it for a dollar a foot but that has to be on a referendum if that's what we do if we can give a walking easement or an encroaching week for the first reason that'd be fun too but whatever we do for one you know and i'm not going by what they did in the past we are here because we didn't like what was going on in the past but um you know let's do it right now and make sure we do it in the future because if this person comes along i think the next person will be behind them is a problem yeah it seems like what happens is [Music] and [Music] is that my problem as a city person that's what we have to be thinking about here and there are swimming pools that go into that i think in this case the swimming pool deck goes right into it so yeah we'll give it to you well i don't think we're going to go excavate it and put it back to water florida probably let us do that either so all right anybody else have anything else to do i just want to back up for a second on this consent agenda thing it went by pretty fast and my feeling is it's a back step from best practices we we started throwing minutes into consent agenda because 99 times it is a ministerial kind of thing anybody have any objections and this one went askew because it was you who wanted to withdraw stuff or nearly somebody would draw something and they just amend the the agenda right so this one was cute because you well there's a mechanism to do that if you want to make a motion you just pass the gamble but what i'm saying is to start pulling all the minutes out is is backtracking against best practices we just started 12 against those things this is not the attorney general's background best practice i'll tell you that if it's legal cities that's just their opinion but the definition of a consent agenda is a normal recurring item that does not require um any discussion i will show you how many things we have pulled out we constantly usually me because i actually read every quarter of the minutes and find issues with them and so i mean i don't think it takes any time to say you know i have five minutes anybody have any questions we call a voice vote and it's done we can dispose of it almost as quickly okay yeah if there's six things in minutes but patty's been pretty caught up on the minutes we've been getting almost almost like the next time by the best practices i mean having attended other city council meetings that's typically already i just attended the ems board of pinellas county's emergency services way others do it look however you want if it gets buried i mean it shouldn't matter whether it was me making it anybody who has an issue with the minutes i think deserves to be heard i didn't even get a motion so you've got bad minutes i mean they're not killers they're accurate it was a six to one vote you'll just never know who that person is if you're reading the commitment so that's wrong i don't think it should be married so for the one time we started pulling out all the minutes we should pull out all the minutes all the time so that's the point okay and you can fly through i mean come on do i have a motion to approve the june 6 minutes yes second anybody have any comments no anybody's kid citizens no okay call the question done voice vote yes what did that take 30 seconds if there's nothing i mean i don't think our time is that crazy issue okay i mean i'll go with the consensus i just said that you know recall the voice voted against a few minutes uh none of this calls my role i don't that i thought was an improvement and i appreciated that suggestion we've integrated and i think it does make things quicker i love the consensus i just think that we should have that opportunity to speak about the minutes the rest of the stuff national city clerk's week i'm totally fine with making that in the consensus that was fine you know it was a city clerk's month it's like city clerk's year whatever [Music] i think to help speed up the meetings that we all believed in agenda but you can call for our [Music] um okay that's what we'll do but if we start getting errors with the minutes then you know we'll see usually they're excellent but we do need to move minutes out if somebody has a concern i'm very concerned about that so um anyway that's two people i think last time we had unanimity so that's five to two right now who wants a name that can say who wants it in conservation one two three four okay so leave that we've changed our mind so we'll leave them in the consent agenda and we'll pull them out if there's a problem i will call a non-roll votes until we see that this problem is taken care of okay everything will be sorry i said no no don't trash don't trash anything public records go off you couldn't even so much as a doodle on that it's a public record so yeah i wouldn't trash anything but that's best practices too okay second everybody favor hi no don't begin good night"
