our city manager will make a staff report the applicant will then make a statement we will then open it up for discussion between the board members and the applicant and then we will vote on a series of criteria and six different questions for our city code we'll go through them one at a time and we'll vote on each individual ones per our for our ordinance at that time after the sixth the criteria questions are answered I will entertain a motion in a second regarding the vote itself and regarding the variance itself I will announce that in my case tonight I have a conflict of interest I have filled out a state form because as owner of Kelly pools and this being a Kelly pool application I will be abstaining in the vote I'm refusing myself at First State ordinance that I am required to make that announcement so that every everybody understands in advance that I can give information but I will not enrollment how are you ready for there's a 15 upward point but I apologize okay are very into request tonight number 23-20 at 112 18th Street Mary Jo Henderson is requesting a variance from section 10-174 regarding setbacks Heights and widths of swimming pools subsection G says that the height of a swimming pool shall be no higher than 18 inches above the crown of the road any structured part of a permanently installed in-ground swimming pool response shall not be built higher than 24 inches above the pool depth including race decks race bars race pool beams upper level decks and raised waterfalls exhilary deck mounted equipment such as handrails ladders grab rats Diamond boards and slides shall not be subject to the height requirements set forth in this section they the request is to install a swimming pool and depth four inches above the maximum height above the ground above the city correct at this point I'll turn it over to Kyle and let him make a staff report and fill us in on why we're here thank you chairman Kyle replayer city manager at Miller Beach so we received the permanent application and plans and noticed that the the elevation was greater than 18 inches from the elevation of the crown of the road as I sent it on 2L carrier PE with trans systems and he reviewed it he replied the letter is an impact that he replied that the young players requesting a variance from the following other Beach city codes division two swimming pools section 10-174g this request is to construct a pool greater than 18 inches above the crown of the road height the proposed pullback elevation is 22 inches above the crown of the room the various requested for the pool to be four inches above the crop and then he goes and states the section of code is it normal for Al to make a recommendation to approve or deny or is that mainly information it's me and the information he's just pointing out that it does not comply with the code okay okay thank you Craig Patty have we received any correspondence whatsoever regarding this variance no sir okay at this point I would like Mary Jo Anderson or representative to please come to the podium and tell us about your case hey Mary Jo Henderson 112 18th Street thank you uh for spending some time this evening to listen to the variance request basically my home with the grade above the street level as a nice elevation which is certainly very handy during Hurricane Season but with this unusual code I guess I will say it would I guess prohibiting from putting the pool in and the problem is all my neighbors pools if I met the code I would have to lower the pool so low that every time it rained the one from all the neighboring yards and their swimming pools would all run into my new pool which would be quite low um so therefore that's why I requested the variance I am just getting over pretty nasty chest goals I'm going to turn over to Chris to finish speaking in my behalf so Chris you want to come up absolutely continue with them thank you thank you hello everybody Chris Arnold with Kelly pools and I'll be speaking on behalf of Mary Jo so if you guys have any questions feel free to direct it to me or to her just like Kyle said we're requesting the variance for four inches of relief current code is 18 inch above the crown of the road if you want to take a look at the plans in that packet there's some elevations marked on the Kelly pools plan the Mary Jo's house currently was an original house built at grade it's not a new construction home it's not built up higher than the other houses adjacent ever her current house is built at 26 inches above the crown of the road we're going to be doing a step down out of her house to lower that down four inches to have the pool deck elevation set at that height the issue is that four inches doesn't sound like too much however if we want another four inches down to try to satisfy that code her pool would literally be below her existing grade of her sod her patios and she would have an issue with neighboring water coming into her swimming pool so with that being said um I think you guys might be looking at changing that code down the road I think we have another one ourselves coming before your board next month and I think there's been a few in the past too so um I know the other ones have been looked at and been approved because of that same reasoning so we're just asking for the same and if there's any questions that I can clarify or answer for you guys I'll be happy to do so Gerald was the line board member I'm seeing at the pool is being built adjacent to an ambition to the home is that correct that's correct is there a level change up or down step from the current level of the current home onto the Edition I don't police so very Joe is that no it's at the same finished floor height as what is currently there so there's no elevation change in the pool construction's got nothing to do with that proposed elevation of the New Edition thank you yes sir anybody Carol Connery are there pools on either side right now there is a pull to the west side for sure that I know of and the other one there are multiple pools on the street [Music] down into the pool to the West is a pool there even as the adjacent plot going across there and I don't believe they have a I don't believe they have a pool but their yard elevation is still up at that height so regardless of whether there's a pool or a patio or sod back there there's going to be an issue with water going into a report since it would be below great I yes I would agree with that one who was the one board member I see the house was book built in 1996 based on a tax record no 1957 . yeah okay thank you any other questions thanks Chris thank you at this point I'll um direct every board member to take out our worship a variance request worksheet I'll wait till everybody has it in front of it is our criteria this is the actual [Music] procedure that we're going to follow to review all the questions the applicant has answered all of these questions are answered in the application specifically so as we go through these if you need to review the application fine if that you're ready already we'll ask for a vote as soon as I get to the end of each question okay we've got the worksheets in front of you let's go to question number one the right print in order to authorize any variates from the provisions of this chapter the board of adjustment

Gardella Mr gatliff yes Mr Mariano yes Mr wisawati aye Mr Kelly since those six I will that we've already reviewed at this point on Entertainer motion if you have a motion by Mr Beam we have a second by Ms Connery how do you go ahead and complete the role Mr Bean Miss Connery aye Mr Gardella Mr gatliff yes Mr Mariano Mr wisowati aye Mr Kelly abstain on that note variance number 23-20 for relate to four inches of the maximum height in the city code is approved is there any other information to come before the board any more comments as Chris just said earlier we have another variance coming up seems the same as this situation here at Miller Beach relative to the same code provision Kyle at any point is there going to be a work session to put this thing in the future or a cohort division or code revision board put together to review these perhaps uh yes I believe at the March work session I've made the requests that we have another code review board and we're dealing with the the building codes and some of the Boat Land Development code it was recommended by the attorney that we try to bring in a consultant so I have contacted um they were representative that works with FW or FLC Florida legacies and um he did not do that kind of work or for exactly what we're looking for when he made some recommendations so I'm going to follow up on that I'm going to try and bring in somebody to work hand in hand with our code review board when we're reviewing such ordinances effect I'll mention to the board members as I did I think in a previous meeting it stipulates that the board of adjustment members cannot serve on any other board in the city even though that's an ad hoc committee is that correct Kyle that was how it was handled last time I could have the City attorney review that right well even so the situation took place two years ago Carol and I were both on that board that review board right Carol and we had to formally um resign thank you for the from our poster from adjustment so both of us had to go through a reappointment process with the city council and it got real ugly so information only I will not be going on that even if it's an add-on committee because there's a lot of real strong people in this city that would like to do that you could actually attend all the meetings you just don't vote attended every single one of our review board meetings we had a dozen things did we manage everything and went on for months but there was a lot of input from the public and just so happened that two of us were from the board of adjustment we had to resign so I I just suggest you move wisely if you want to get on that committee attend and let isn't there another committee we have here in the the city that citizens reuse citizens advisory committee would they also participate to think in that or would they just advise they could participate in some sections of the code but the attorney recommended that we used to planning and zoning board for the line development okay so this perhaps might come up in the next month or two or a couple months I'll open in a couple months yes okay well at least we're moving in the direction of review and that's all we can ask for it was advised back in August when Tony you had your variants Lynn Reeves the previous city manager said you guys can do one of two things go for variance or wait until the city changes its code and as the applicant tonight and Tony in the past one coming up in May they've each chosen the other Americans so Mary Jo thank you very much for your patience through this it's been a complicating process but with the approval of the board we're ready to roll Kyle thank you very much for Expediting this so we can move forward with this just have this has been approved thank you very much I appreciate it if there's nobody go ahead no thank you Barbara yeah it's I'd like to say um I think why for everyone on this board to attend as many quote but just like this board we tend to have the same kind of areas that's come up all the time for years it's been the same kind of variances could see ones it's been what we call reverse pie lights where the the Waterfront but they're in the back and they're now really you know it's just you've got a huge front yard you've got nothing but 40 or 50 feet in the backyard Dave Dennis said the same situation Frank Gillian in the same situation this board sees the same kind of variances so there's a situation that the city can ride dirt on and potentially change the code it makes life easier for the staff and easier for our board and I think that's the direction of their head Mike Gary go ahead a question if we intend some of these committees committed dinner for yourself as a board member and then put them in common yes they're allowed the chairman of the board of that review board is a council member has been a vascot and he or she can ask once they go around the room and talk to the individual members of the committee they'll take comments and questions from the rest of the people sitting in the room the meetings in the past were held in the little assembly room over there on the side but they they got kind of full so maybe if there's more people attending Kyle you end up being here kind of life and work sessions so they're going in a positive direction that's all I'm going to say so any board member like Mark just said should consider attending any they're usually help late in the afternoon I think four or five o'clock yes I think they were doing like six maybe oh okay back here I thought those meetings were in the afternoon but it'll be whatever the committee really yeah whatever works yeah all right but no further business we stand adjourned"
