report Deputy clapa good evening mayor council members staff citizens Deputy clapa for the record uh for the month of November um we had about onethird of my code enforcement violations that we're dealing with grass overgrowth uh which we have resolved a lot of those issues another third of it again is dealing with unpermitted uh remodels or any type of building uh the rest of it was mainly uh some houses that needed to be repainted which we have got we've cleared those up um and then again some of the other issues were trailers and boats parked in yards or up in in driveways which those have all been completed um if you'll notice that this is a short report um last month or in uh last of October first of November I was off for two weeks uh and Danny dowy was going to stand in for me in case we had any problems um so that's my report and I'll stand for any questions Council I don't know if this would be on your agenda or even the city managers but I got uh Friday night and I think I brought it to your attention one time there the junction boxes that they're doing for these underground lighting underground power I mean um a lot of them like at Sixth Street Seventh Street I think Seventh Street might be closed but like from First Street up to the causeway they're about a foot and a foot out above ground they're six foot square and there's no cover and you could there's at least a two foot drop in there yes sir so I don't know who would we be addressing that too that would be the contractor that's actually doing that type of work um I've never gotten any complaints or any asked any questions about it but there's something we can somebody put cones at the Sixth Street one yes but there's um and I think also down on third they put cones around that one too okay but they should be covered up yeah okay we we we can um uh we can address that with the the contractor I do want to say it's been a pleasure working with you all in case you don't know I am being transferred actually my first day was uh working down in Readington North Readington Beach uh that's going to be my new assignment uh for the rest of this week and part of next week I'll have the new Deputy who's gonna be out here his name is Richard Trump uh he's going to be taking over my duties here in Beller Shore and Beller Beach so again um it's been a pleasure working with with you all and unfortunately you know uh I'm I'm being transferred so if uh like I said if anything ever comes up you still have my phone number I'll be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns that we have I have one comment um you can tell mayor quain we don't appreciate it I will do that I I appreciate uh your good service and uh and and you've done us very well I I greatly appreciate it and

question answer session with the Church of the Isles that's the property that we're um moving forward with to purchase to build an additional fire station which will better serve b beach and we also met with the county on that issue as well last week um and meeting again with them in the next couple of weeks about putting together midyear funding for a peak time Rescue Unit that would be you know the idea is to have it on Friday Saturday Sunday and Mondays during the holidays um as that station's being built and then it would be full-time and we would move the fire engine here which would be it's only a two-minute drive to this building from where it's currently located so it's going to really improve the response times to this area so we continue to work on that um I'll be Tallahasse for

okay yes Mr Roberts um K on I just curious how many um contractors attended the non-mandatory pre-bid meeting did anybody come in two to attend you came in okay Y and you said uh 10 potential contractors downloaded the plan plans yes I'm just curious about how many did that same step when we did 12th and 13th we did not put it on demand St we only advertise it on in the paper and the website okay so we had two contractors were you familiar with them or yes um Ajax Paving and k&r which did 12th and 13th okay excellent any other questions or comments for the city manager no all right thank you very much Mr Reef you now we will move right over to the consent agenda which is items nine and 10 this is for approval of the November 6 2023 city council meeting minutes and approval of the November 13th 2023 special city council meeting minutes do I have a motion to approve motion to approve the present agenda as written and proposed all right and do I have a second second all in favor I any opposed all right the consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 11 this is for consideration of resolution 2023-24 d8 a resolution of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida establishing an auditor selection and oversight committee providing for membership of the committee providing for the identification of the chairperson providing for duties and responsibilities of the committee providing for meetings of the committee and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of resolution 20238 by title only Mr Mayor um in as much as I was asked to this is on the agenda as though um presented by me I was approached by the city manager and and asked about the process for selecting the auditor for the coming year for those those of you who have been serving for that amount of time you may recall a similar resolution from 2021 um establishing an audit committee and reviewing that in the statutory language it looked like there were some tweaks um that were necessary uh Chief among them the statute requires that while a council member does serve on that committee they must be the chair and that's not how it was previously structured um and a few other little things just to make this clear so this resolution um largely parrots the language you would find in the statute um this uh the the duties and responsibilities set forth in section three are divided into two categories to capture the process for selecting the auditor and then the continuing engaged role of this subcommittee which would be composed entirely of one of you and your CAC this um your citizens advisory committee this was one of the contemplated functions of your citizens advisory committee so um you would you would come together in that context wearing that hat and then providing continuing oversight so that's the purpose of this resolution happy to answer any questions you may have thank you Mr Mo before we take questions from the council I'm going to go to the citizens would any citizen like to comment on this proposed resolution seeing as there are no takers on that we'll bring it back to the council I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution do I have a motion motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second I'm going to give that one to Vice May Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor I believe Mr Moore has explained it pretty well you any other comments no all right well let's uh take it to a vote Mr reefer would you please call the rooll council member Frank Banker yes council member Mark Chester yes council member Leslie Noto yes council member Lloyd Roberts hi vice mayor Jody Shirley hi mayor Dave Gattis hi so the resolution passes unanimously thank you mayor I do wish to add though not specifically on the agenda the resolution contemplates the appointment of a member to serve on the committee a member from this body to serve on the committee and chair that committee um recognizing some of you may not be with us uh come the New Year if you if you desire I think it'd be most helpful to make that appointment now so that the the committee can begin its business but if not we can do that at a later meeting I wish to indulge the council as to how they wish to proceed question does that can that be done in a work session too we typically don't take official acts at work sessions you're not going to see that in a statute but by the way this body works and its rules of procedure typically we do that we take official acts at meetings so we could I I don't know that a whole lot's going to happen between now and the January meeting if this board desire if the council Des desires to wait um but I did want to make sure uh you were aware of that option I would propose that we nominate someone at this meeting tonight and I would like to nominate lesie Mato second no no thank you no thank you any others I would propose that we wait only because we're going to have a at least one additional possibly two additional members at the next meeting that may have some backgrounds that are very strong in that area I am one that doesn't have a strong background in that area but hopefully we'll have somebody in the accounting auditing background and skill sets that might fit Council what do you think I stay with Mr Robert's suggestion all right uh is that acceptable that's that's that's I mean I I defer to manager ref but that's certainly acceptable it's a legal course of action it's really up to you I I I don't know the administrative pressures so I defer to manage a reefer in that regard so the um the audit committee the audit selection committee will need to meet just to approve the RFP before it goes out um given it's the holidays I don't know if we to be able to get a meeting in December so if we do it in the January meeting and appoint the chair off of council that should work fine then we'll we'll meet and release it okay yep that sounds like a good idea and uh we'll uh what I would recommend if uh if anyone changes their mind or they decide they uh they would like to be on this uh would like to be on this committee then U please contact the city manager and uh put your name in the Hat so all right now we will move on to item number 12 this is consideration of applicants to fill the vacant City Council seat uh which is uh to replace Belinda Livingstone uh we have two candidates uh we have one which is Kimberly Shaw Elliot and we have Michael Hayward uh Kimberly Shaw is not here tonight she is actually attending or not attending but she is with a very close long-term friend uh with a serious surgery so she was unfortunately unable to make it uh but she's she's on Zoom oh is she here yes okay yes I am here I was just able to unmute good afternoon excuse um what I was uh GNA do was Let each uh each uh s or I'm sorry um applicant introduce themselves to the council and let the council ask a few questions and uh we'll just take them in the order that they're they're printed out uh so while we have you online and it sounds like we have a good uh Clear Connection uh Kimberly Shaw Elliot would you like to introduce yourself to the council well thank you very much of Mr Mayor and I appreciate this opportunity uh very much and I'm honored to do so um I know many of you uh so uh I I'll uh give a little bit of an introduction to my background uh that you might not be aware of one is I hope I offer a unique set of cir of experiences here uh professionally I've spent most of my entire career in the financial services industry and what's unique about that is that I've done it as both an attorney and in other uh positions as an executive and Financial Services firms so hopefully I can give reasonable legal advice but come up with practical Solutions and understanding what that means to implement um that advice uh here of course we have the incredibly uh good Services of Mr MOA um but in terms of this role hopefully I understand what it means when we uh enter into ordinances and have an idea of what the Practical implications of those are in those executive roles that I've served in um I have been accountable for managing very large budgets I've been understand what it is to manage to a budget um I've engaged in strategic planning um and um uh uh being accountable for results uh from a Civic perspective I have uh been previously on a Planning Commission on a zoning board of appeals um I've been on a variety of different charitable boards and um Boards of professional organizations personally I've moved to uh Beller beach in 2015 which now seems like a significant period of time but um I I still feel every day like I'm on vacation when I'm living there so very pleased to be part of this community um I have had a lifelong love of the um of uh Florida uh we traveled here as a family when I was a kid every year for Christmas time so um here I am uh the opposite now um in the north uh during this holiday season um I tell you a little bit about that is that my dog who is a good Florida girl uh I took her outside this morning to the door she literally stuck her nose out turned around ran back in the house all the way upstairs and and crawled in a bed so um being the reverse Snowbird is not exactly the the wisest choice that I've made but um I hopefully you can appreciate why I'm here um I've had an acute interest in the environment and with our Beach Community I think we have a lot of pressures on us in this beautiful beautiful place that we live and that balance between how do we preserve that beauty and how do we protect our homes and how do we make a livable circumstance so um I'm I'm happy to be part of the challenges to try to figure out those Solutions as we look at our future I recently semi-retired and I'm actually considering full retirement probably in the near future so with that I'll have both the time and certainly the energy to to uh meet the challenges of this wonderful community so I have uh a great deal of appreciation for this opportunity I thank you for the opportunity to talk to you today and I welcome any questions that you might have thank you Miss Elliott Council any questions for Miss Elliott vice mayor Shirley yeah hi Kim good to see you sorry not the best circumstances for you um I hope your friend's okay but have a couple questions have you picked up a packet for the qualifying for this upcoming election I have and the interesting thing about that is that I thought that this would be kind of a shortterm um appointment if it's successful um but I did learn before I left that the the opening period is now so uh I completed that application and the uh petitions before I left and submitted them on Friday okay good perfect and are you currently serving on a committee am I correct in saying that I'm not sure yes um the for forgive me I'm blanking on the name of it it's it's it's not the zoning board what what is the name of the planning Planning and Zoning is that what it is that yes planning planning yes okay thank you I think that's all I have thank you any uh any other questions from the council no all right thank you Mr Elliot I appreciate you taking time uh to be with us this evening uh next up is Michael Hayward uh Mr Hayward would you like to come up to the podium please thank you Mr Mayor and City Council Members I'm back so I was taught that if you believe in something um you shouldn't give up so I'm here again in um I'm kind of sad Mr RFI left I wanted to talk to him about it up here he's actually my neighbor and like my next door neighbor and he was there with me like growing up um he helped me out a lot like when I got my security clearance and for my um job at the state department and he helped me out when my mom was sick and he he doesn't know this I wanted to tell him that but like he would tell my mom about working for the city and he did influence me a lot to like take action and to be a part of something and to like be involved so I want to thank him but he left anyway to um remind you guys uh like my background um I grew up here I've lived in the city for over 30 years like this is all I know um I went away for college and for other jobs but I'm back um right now I don't have anything to keep me away from doing uh the city council job um for the foreseeable future at least all the way up until March when it expires so I'm very available um yeah and my background like I like U I went to school political science got Ms in international studies um so it's big passion of mine to be a part of something bigger than me and to give back and I appreciate you all for having me again thank you Mr heward do we have any questions for Mr Hayward I'm sorry just to clarify you were saying something ends in March well the next election okay that's make sure right thanks and I picked up my packet of paper so I'm filling all that out good Mr rward uh what what are you doing currently I work for a movie production company and I run movie productions in the area but right now there's none none going on so I understand all right any other questions or comments all right thank you very much Mr Hayward uh before we continue I need to go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to comment about either of these candidates no all right citizen comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion from the council uh to continue uh with this uh vacancy uh filling this V vacan SE I have a motion so moved motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by Leslie NATO Mr Roberts you have the floor yeah uh once again I think we're we're blessed that we have two candidates that um there's no wrong answer here I think they're both extremely qualified and more importantly I feel like they have their heart in wanting to work for our city so that's wonderful so um think you go ahead and vote uh like to Echo those comments but I'm GNA go to on the question um we have one vote we have one vacancy right now another one coming up in less than three weeks why don't we just put both these people on tonight um because if we did that tonight we would not have uh properly posted the second vacant SE I believe 206c of our Charter gives Council full authority to do that I presume the silence and looks in my direction request 2.06 certainly gives the council full direction to proceed as it Desires in filling vacancies the the vacancy advertised this evening or that is being heard this evening was specifically advertised to fill the one position uh if this Council feels that it may yield um yield additional candidates to fill and and for the sake of clarity both in the record and and what we're talking about here you are presently filling the vacancy owing to um Miss livingstone's resignation in the interim since marketing this position it has been announced at the risk of stealing any Thunder um that vice mayor Shirley will resign from her position effective in the next few weeks before the end of the New Year I'm understanding council member Bank question to say well if she's if her resignation is forthcoming should we put both these POS people in those vacancies with different effective dates you would still have to decide tonight who fills this role so we can swear them in there is no other role to be sworn in tonight which is another procedural but complicating Factor um as to how you proceed ultimately it is your discretion as to how you proceed um I I I think both positions have good Merit which is we told people we noticed that we would be filling one position tonight not two and somebody may have said you know what I wasn't really comfortable at that time maybe now I am or otherwise and you may be able to get others but I understand council member Banker's position that we have two vacancies and two people how do we wish to proceed in this case the coun the the charter states that you folks fill vacancies I defer to you as to how you proceed it is your city your community my my only point is that we're not doing anything underhanded illegal or whatever we have the right under 206c to fill the vacancy we don't have to post it or advertise it I'm in in the meantime I'm I while you while you discuss or deliberate I'm also verbally stalling while I get to read the precise language of the charter um but I would tell you that um you know illegal is not really as you said a concern here um interrupt you I just don't you have two candidates you have three months before this election cycle is over um we have a vacancy coming up so it doesn't look like there's a favoritism or anything like that or friends and family are going to be pulled into the next opening you got two great candidates on the board here and I don't think we're violating the charter at all in fact I think we're my my motion is to follow the charter right and so the language of the charter and I course I would submit follows the charter but um the the language of the charter again for clarity in the record says filling the vacancies a vacancy on the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council any person appointed by Council to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual election and and and it continues um as to how we would proceed if there were less of you Etc um there is no statute specifically governing this because this is one of the like the remaining home rule Powers we have um so this is a home rule decision in that sense of how do we how do we proceed and again I tender it to you as a councel as to how you proceed I did not anticipate the inquiry so my apologies but um that is um ultimately your your uh judgment I would suggest regardless that you decide how you're going to fill the first vacancy um regardless all right I've uh I've heard comments from council member Banker I'd like to hear comments from other council members before I give my comments yes Mr Roberts so we we currently have two candidates it sounds like both candidates have already filled out the um qualifying package for the election coming up in March which is a good thing however my real question is um Randy so somebody let's say we postponed it until the next meeting meeting for the selection of the second opening and that person had not qualified for the election in March what what issue would that cause if any a great question thank you council member Roberts for the question and for the benefit of all the question is is it is it is it relevant at all how we feel this position relative to whether or not the person is qualified for the March 2023 record uh election restated um no uh you're really specifically concerned with just the the Bridging the Gap if you will between whenever you make the appointment and the March election you need not have qualified um in some communities people are very adamant that they want anybody serving in an interim capacity to not be running in other situations people want to know there's the possibility of continuity and that's again a personal decision that each of you make is you weigh who who best to fill the position but there's not any direct relationship or requirement between whether or not somebody opts to run in March and whether they are suitable qualified Etc to serve between January and March okay other comments Mr Chester I'm I'm just a little slow to change what we already had planned I think Frank makes some good points but know I came here tonight ready to vote on this the way it was proposed but okay um Lesly I'm of the opinion that we vote to replace one person tonight we have one opening right now so we vote one replacement vice mayor Shirley I would agree with what lesle said um there's still opportunity that even if we um the qualifying period is not over until the eth um I I see that as a benefit that someone's taken the initiative to be interested in uh qualifying for the election because it is such a short period of time gives us kind of a view from uh from a voter standpoint to see what uh potential candidate might look like um on Council long long range um but on our agenda we have uh we came in tonight to vote for one person there's currently one seat open I even though in the future there'll be a second one it's not open until the end of December and I think we should stay at the course and then my comment is um box mayor sherle is not out the door until she's out the door um she may get get a uh a voice in the middle of the night or something that makes her change her mind and realize just how much she loves this community so I'm not giving up on her yet um I uh would also uh I I know for a fact that there's several uh potential candidates who were still weighing in on the whole uh do I have to do a full Financial disclosure report and uh I think that um they're because they're already considering running uh it would be uh it would be a shame not to give them the opportunity to fill vice mayor Shirley's seat uh and at least know it's coming instead of having to uh kind of get blindsided by a hasty vote tonight so I would I would prefer that we hold off and uh and only handle one seat tonight um Mr Banker I'll give you the last word I apologize you for thinking outside the box all right uh so that being said uh we now need to decide on one candidate um where are the ballots at one at each seat yeah all right before I actually uh before we actually vote I have to go through a few things I have some formal procedures here that I have to follow uh but I am still looking for my ballot got it all right it says the mayor has the duty to maintain firm control of the meeting consistent with the provisions of the city Charter city code and Robert's Rules of Order the mayor shall announce that the audience must refrain from any outward display of approval or disapproval of any applicant uh the mayor states that the seat being filled shall hold office until the next annual election in the city on March 19th 2024 the mayor shall confirm with each applicant that they are a qualifying registered voter which I am about to do uh qualifying physical resident qualifying permanent resident and qualified by civil rights so let's take care of that one uh right now um is Miss Elliott still online yes I am okay great so I'm going to ask you each one of these questions here uh are you uh a qualified registered voter yes sir are you qualified physical resident yes sir are you a qualified permanent resident I'm are you a permanent res resident in B yes I yes I live there permanently okay and are you qualified by civil rights yes okay thank you very much all right now let's go to Mr Hayward uh if you would sir uh just stand up for us and uh and let's confirm this uh so are you a qualified registered voter all right and are you a qualified physical resident right are you a qualified permanent resident and are you qualified by civil rights all right thank you very much uh let's see here here uh we've already done our presentations uh and let's see here we've we've asked questions so we've gotten past that and I believe oh here we go after the council has concluded it's inquiry of the applicants the floor shall be open to the public which we've done uh the clerk Mr reefer uh was the timekeeper after the public addresses uh Council uh council members shall vote by paper ballots with results announced that an applicant has attained a majority of the votes of the council members voting the city manager shall announce the result results so uh so everyone find your ballots and let's vote only pick one okay so council member Frank Banker selected uh Kimberly Shaw Elliott council member Mark Chester selected Kimberly Shaw Elliott council member Leslie Noto selected Kimberly Shaw Elliott council member Lloyd Roberts selected Kimberly Shaw Elliott vice mayor Jody Shirley selected Kimberly Shaw Elliott and mayor Dave Gattis elected Emily Shaw Elliott so that is six thank you Mr reefer uh and uh so that's um unanimous for Elliott I'd like to thank Mr Hayward for volunteering and I'd like to welcome uh Miss Elliott to the council uh normally we would call you forward to be sworn in I believe that has to be done in person is that correct um I think it'd be best if we did given that there's no urgency and and and afford michaw Elliot a little bit of the pump and Circumstance of being present for the moment as well um unless this commission unless the council feels otherwise I think it'd be prudent okay thank you uh and uh Mr Hayward uh next month we're doing it again I'm sure so I will see you at that meeting also and congratulations uh Kim Shaw Elliott uh we look forward to working with you thank you very much I'm very honored to be part of this Council and looking forward to working with each and every one of you and hopefully you too Shirley okay so now we have to do a motion to appoint the applicant who has received at least four votes which I believe we've we've already established that but we have to do it formally so I need a motion to appoint uh Kimberly Shaw Elliott to the council so moved motion made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second I'll give that one to Mark Chester uh we're gonna have to take this to a vote so um Mr reefer would you please do a roll call council member Frank Banker yes council member Mark Chester yes council member Leslie Noto yes council member Lloyd Roberts hi vice mayor Jody Shirley hi mayor Dave gtis and so it's unanimous and now it's official welcome to the council and we'll see you at swearing Yen thanks very much uh just for the record did I get that right was that was that close enough okay good good all right and I would like to uh to thank Miss NATO for the assist also all right now we are on to item number 13 this is to off authorized the city manager to execute a purchase order for the replacement of the community meeting room carpet he says he doesn't like the color no he didn't say that but I just thought I'd throw that in there you know Mr wler you have the floor that's thank you mayor so yes this is to replace the carpet In This Very Room um this carpet has been here since the building was built so it's it's been in use for about 13 plus years uh many public meetings and uh wedding and other party rentals have happened here um it's just over time taking its its wear and tear as you can see it's starting to show um through fading and some stain so um given the amount of uh meetings and rentals that we do in this room um we've been saving to replace the carpet uh each year in our budget and I found um a quality carpet that I've uh included the uh quotation form which is off of a sourcewell quote which is also um a uh alternative uh alternate contract Source on the state's uh Department of Management Services website um it is a billum carpet shade uh it has some tones of green but overall it's a gray um not so much of a defined pattern as what we have in here um but we when the staff looked through all the samples we thought that we wanted to catch the the green undertones um that this room has through its trim already and uh we feel that this will over time not show um stains as as they come from from the use so um like I said I I included the specifications and uh the sample I've also um laid out the sample and I I've emailed you guys pictures um just to so you could see it in the room um but again I'm asking that uh being that this is uh piggy vac or or sorry quoted off a sourcewell contract um that was uh on an RFP done by sourcewell um that we move forward and a approve this purchase and the amount is going to be for $ 32,423 and both the like I said the material and the labor are quoted off of source well so we satisfy our purchasing requirements and that's all I have thank you Mr reefer uh before we bring this to the council we need to go to the citizens for comments on this uh on this agenda item would anyone like to speak about the carpet all right citizen comments are now closed going to need a motion from the council would someone like to make a motion that we authorize city manager to ask you to P purchase order so Mo motion made by Leslie NATO do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts Miss NATO you have the floor we leave it up to city manager all right any other questions or comments no all right uh because this is a large expenditure I'm going to ask that we do a roll call vote just so that we're on record of spending some money okay council member Frank Banker yes council member Mark Chester yes council member Leslie Notaro yes council member Lloyd Roberts hi vice mayor Jody Shirley I mayor Dave gtis hi so it passes unanimously Mr reefer you are authorized to proceed thank you sir all right we're up to item number 14 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business okay in that case we are now up to item number 15 which is city council comments this month we begin with council member bankard um three weeks from today we'll be celebrating the birth of Christ while his Earthly father sought shelter the night of his birth as The Story Goes he was told there was no room I hope and pray that all residents they haven't brought Christ into their home will this holiday season finally Merry Christmas to all and city manager Le the lights on through January 6th thank you Mr Banker all right up next is council member Roberts thank you Mr Mayor you know I know there's been a lot of talk and discussion and wondering about the um Infamous form six that we we've been challenged to to to deal with um something that's coming up I believe it's Wednesday the Florida League of cities has established a zoom meeting um and so I'm planning on definitely signing on to that and really my message is if there's um Mr Mayor mentioned that there were several people that he's aware of that may be considering I would highly recommend that if you're considering which I hope I would love to see like 25 people um fill out packets to run on for our positions but if you're interested in in running and you have some question or you're concerned about the form six I would highly recommend I'm sure anybody can get on the fla League of cities website and go ahead and sign up for that uh session that they're going to be presenting I would also assume it's going to be a question and answer type environment so we can all learn a little bit more about it I kind of get a good feel that there's so much discussion going on about this particular issue and I kind of feel like a lot of us maybe I think the state is marketing this very well that they're causing scenarios and I can't walk in anybody else's shoes but I feel like they're causing uncomfortableness to anybody that's considering or is already in in positions that are going to require the form six so please take the opportunity anybody that's interested in running for a position to learn everything you can about it then again it's this Wednesday and I think that would position everybody better to make a decision that they have more knowledge about and hopefully are more comfortable with and Merry Christmas to everybody out there who listening with the city to our Council and everybody in the audience thank you thank you Mr Roberts up next is council member Chester yeah I would like to wish everybody a safe and happy holiday um to everyone out there in our little community and to my fellow council members mayor and our two paid Associates over there them as well and uh I want to Second what um Frank said um this is a great time to spend with family U but it's also a good time to remember why we celebrate uh what we are doing and it's the birth of Christ so thank you thank you Mr Chester um Miss NATO um I G to say merry Christmas happy holidays to fellow council members to all the residents of Belair Beach um you all have a safe and wonderful holiday thank you thank you vice mayor Shirley M well I want to start by saying thank you all for the the two candidates we had for the open seat and I hope that you'll come uh back when we have more open seats because I foresee that coming in the near future um as I have um resigned my position on Council um due to the form six requirements this new law that has been U put into place um and you know it it takes away some rights to privacy as us as council members yes we are elected officials but there are some things that you know between my husband and myself and not open to public and then my financial disclosure is one of those things that's just not open to the public so uh especially given some of the history of the city and some of the uh lawsuits that are still open it's a it's an uneasy feeling so I uh have chosen to resign although I appreciate everyone's um support and um have been blessed to be able to serve our community and hope to be able to um still help out with the city on in other areas where it won't provide where I won't have to provide that form six disclosure um I want to say thank you to everyone for um putting faith in me to to uh support the city also just Merry Christmas I hope everyone has a blessed holiday season with their family and um get out and support our community whenever the opportunity is there thank you thank you vice mayor Shirley it's been an honor to work with you and uh I think you're still committed to a work session is that right that's right okay so I won't say my final goodbyes at least on the council until uh until then um I'd like to remind everyone here and at home that you are what makes belir Beach the Envy of pelis County despite the new rules that Tallahassee has thrust upon us we still need talented and trustworthy candidates with a love for their City uh for this upcoming election if you would like a seat on this Council please help us help us to keep Belair Beach belir be and pick up a k a packet from Kyle a candidates packet and uh uh if you're if you're seriously thinking about it uh please uh as Mr Robert suggested look into the form six presentation that's Wednesday Wednesday okay and I appreciate you bringing that up and uh uh other than that oh I will say this uh the way that I've calculated it right now we're either going to have five or three seats that need to be filled in the next election uh so that's it'll be three if it doesn't uh if it if the uh we don't reduce the council it'll be five that's a huge bill for for belir Beach because normally it's four and three but we're asking for five people right now so I just want to keep that in mind uh this is a wonderful community that we live in uh I think that we're all here because we love this city and we love our neighbors and uh I'm hoping that there's others that are willing to and put themselves out there uh to serve this great community and help keep it what it is um other than that I'd like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts all in favor I any opposed all right good night everyone"
