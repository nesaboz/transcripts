    "transcript": "good afternoon everyone we'd like to welcome you to the February 23rd 2023 park and rec board meeting um may I have a motion to well first of all we're supposed to nominate the vice chair and the secretary and typically before we do the call to or I'm doing the call to order but the roll call the secretary does the roll call so I would like to make a motion to move number four and number five to number one and number two so first of all um I'll talk to you a little bit about the positions on the park and record of the vice chair and the secretary so for the vice chair you pretty much um you help me or take my place if I can't be here or if um there needs to be a presentation at the city council meeting then you would stand in my place it doesn't happen a whole lot like maybe it's happened once in two and a half years um but every once in a while like I had a funeral I had to go out of town and like someone stepped in for me to run the beach clean up that Saturday so um but otherwise it's you just you participate in in group functions just like you normally would and then the secretary Patty will do based on the agenda that I sent her an outline where you really don't have to do a whole lot of writing you just fill in the blanks and you take the high notes because the meeting is recorded and posted on YouTube so it's not real detailed because if we need to get any detailed information we can just go right back to the recording okay that I could do so well with that being said um I'd like to nominate Deb for secretary as long as it's not too much writing all in favor all right thanks and it's not too much typing either right she's doing the taping um I'm putting in the blanks yeah and then you fill in the blanks and hand it in I could do that okay perfect and then Vice chair may have I can nominate someone someone can nominate themselves someone can nominate someone else I would do it you talked about it before yeah okay all right I would like to nominate um Patty Roberts for vice chair okay let's go move seven all in favor aye aye so all right we're good to go so um Deb can you call the roll please oh I'm stepping right into it you're stepping right into it okay Tammy I'm here Patty here John here and Debbie oh and Alan Aaron Aaron yeah it's a great reality is it Aaron it is oh yeah okay there you go okay okay and they may have a motion to approve we haven't had an official meeting since November 18th of 2022 the minutes from that meeting they have a motion to approve the minute sure on the to approve those minutes yeah all in favor I've double signed these after the meeting all right considering I didn't even see them but yeah they were on the okay so the minutes from the last meeting on November um 18th work approved and then we have no citizens so no citizen comments um okay so agenda item number six so um if you guys have looked at like the park and rec board and I'm sure you all have like on the city's website you know it has activities and park and rec board and you know we've had you know yoga by Tara you know twice here we have Monday Wednesday at 11 30 and then she's on the beach on Saturday at 9 30. and we had stand-up paddle board for two years but all of calendar year last year nobody showed up so we still have the stand-up paddleboard lessons where he does not come here you call him you set it up and then he'll come and meet you like you do the whole thing you pay online and then he comes but she was coming here like you know people would sign up online she just didn't get anybody so I think my theory is if you have a stand-up paddle board like I do I'm not gonna pay 35 to come down to City Hall and do it I'm gonna do it in my backyard and if you don't have one you probably did may not have a whole lot of interest in doing it or it may be a little out of you know you may be over your skis a little bit or it may not just be something that you're willing to do without a lesson so with that being said we can talk about it if you have some thoughts but I just kind of wanted to plant the seed because we need to replace her with like one more activity and we've tried boot camp in the past it didn't really go it was me dragging my friends in the neighborhood like I don't do when I still do it I drag them everywhere they're like my little tribe um but we did it a couple times and it was on the beach and it was really messy like I love boot camp but not on the beach you're covered from head to toe and sand your car is covered yoga with yourself yeah yoga was the same way like I would literally stand there and downward dog and look at all the bugs crawling across my hands like people love it though I just don't um so like you don't have to come up with anything right here on the spot but like if you think of something or if you know someone um but the way the program works is so like just say Tara for example with the yoga so she charges ten dollars per class if she has two people or 25 people whatever it is she pays the city 25 of each class to use the space um and I'm pretty sure she doesn't pay to use the beach or does she and then they get free parking I can't remember where we came out with that I thought it was a date she uses the beach they just pay for parking or they have their parking pass okay yeah so she's not we're not collecting from that okay so she's only paying on the days that she uses the building um but with that also being said the stand-up had award lady was paying even though she wasn't using the building so um she was because she advertised for her sort of yes whatever the reason may be but um if you think of something and if it you know the schedule fits like I believe like if there is a a luncheon or something like that Tara cancels the the class because the city can't give up like that huge income for someone to rent the room for twelve dollars but it's pretty sometimes yeah and if there's only two people she's been having like 20 plus people no because she has every class I see people walking over the bridge to her class in their yoga mats so she's really growing oh that's one yeah it's amazing she's so happy I saw her on Golf Boulevard the other day and she was just like thank you guys so much for this opportunity so she's she's building like a really solid group of people who love her yoga that's great so like you know we'd love to get one more activity in here it's a great building like to get more residents involved and something that they would like you know at the next um meeting you know I'll also ask for suggestions to say you know is there if there's some requests if people know um an instructor of some type that's looking for a venue to maybe do something about karate or something like that or self-defense or something yeah I mean I've taken those those were super fun like are you thinking like like an every week thing or just like a one-time seminar like a like the yoga like the yoga okay I mean that's you just said suggestions or something oh those are fun I think we talked that word is like oh dance lessons yeah you did yeah that would be fun something that kind of mix it up you know I mean couples can come see old folks and come to learn how to do that stuff so does anybody wanna do a little research on that have pricing yeah look up some things for um the karate and the dance okay like I know Bogdan who was at the health and wellness Fair like the dance magic dance yeah they might be interested if you want to give him okay yeah okay that's awesome thank you and then you can just report back at the next meeting next month okay thank you does anybody have anything else that they want to ask well I have a quick question um would you consider adding tarot to another day well that would be that would be a building yeah exactly there are days I can't make it but there were other days I could you know yeah what do you think about the YouTube can we work around here right now and just we leave the space open until we have to set up something after maybe a Thursday or something else on those days at that time okay really I'll text her I mean if she has that large of a following and you're making money extend it because I've always wanted to try it but you know that's the two days I work Monday and Wednesday all right so a Thursday or yeah yeah and I know she still teaches at drip yoga so I'll check her schedule with that okay absolutely sounds good anybody else okay all good all right um number seven discussion of the boards 2023-24 budget for city council review so we're kind of in a position where um here I'm going to hand out like just last year's budget [Applause] now this isn't 100 we adjusted things but this was what my original budget looked like and we can everybody has one we can tweak it anyway so the events that we do um for this year if you guys want to write down these dates or if you have your calendar or I can email them to you there's only four so um the Halloween event in October is actually our first event wow yeah so that's October 28th that's a Saturday from 10 to 12. we did one year where we did it on a Saturday from 10 to 12 and then we did it once um Sunday on a Sunday in the afternoon and I think we got better attendance it was it just felt a little bit better in the morning and it wasn't quite so hot tonight like it was Blazing class last year so I think the morning did work out a little bit better so there is no wedding on that day so we were able to book it so Saturday October 28th from 10 to 12 is the Halloween Pets and Pals perfect um congratulations so uh the Halloween deal is says here Sunday this is last year this is last year's last year yeah we still have to do this year okay good thank you okay so our next event is December 4th at 5 pm and that's the holiday social and Christmas tree lighting that is one hour from five to six that's where we um brought in like catering from Bel Air Market this past year I think we need to let the community know about that though because a lot of people didn't know you guys were serving food a lot of people didn't come well you know what so we we posted it like we do everything else that food is included well it did say food and I did announce it at the meeting and like 400 people listen to them okay so we were here too there was free beer at that end here yeah so I I had we had Miss Beller Beach I mean they only knew that we had one of those kitties like lined up down the bridge but it's in Shores when I was working for them for the holiday when they did this type of events to try to you know ascertain more people especially the kids was they actually hired out and had someone blow snow basically a amount of snow about Santa Claus and that's cute um and it we have a lot of people shopping I think we had five 600 people um wow so okay but we're at Reddington Redington Shores yeah did you say five or six hundreds yeah yeah so yeah we can talk about that yeah absolutely it's a good idea we talked about bringing in Santa we talked about bringing gifts in the last two years we get about five kids and that's with us advertising so it wasn't really for it's we don't have we have more dogs here than we have small children and I think a lot of it too I had to bring my four and that you said we only have about five and four of them were mine yeah and then the other two were my neighbors the little kid that stuck the tongs up his nose yeah those were my tongues [Music] anyway and his nose but you know that's how it goes um anyway so that holiday social and we'll get into all the details of all of these different things I'm just giving you the dates right now and then um December 10th literally like the father this is Sunday is the mayor's chili cook-off from ten to two so we're gonna have obviously um like NFL football not College because December 10th December 10th and the other deal is uh December holiday between five and six the fourth right before the city council meeting that's on a Monday so we try to get people like so that's why we brought in the food because we know people are coming right from the office or work and so we wanted to give them the previous year we only had swedes and hot chocolate and you know coffee or whatever we had we didn't have real food so we thought if people are coming here like I know if I'm gonna sit in a two-hour meeting after work I want something more than a cupcake so that's why we ended up bringing just some heavier ABS yeah maybe you could call it like a jingle mingle or the town and like maybe make it two hours and then really have people coming kind of like we'll celebrate together a little more like four to six City Council meetings at six and it ends at seven no it ends when it ends yeah okay so it's early that's what I'm saying it is early it is early I mean to do like uh you lose all the people who work and you still have a lot of people in this community who work but yeah exactly all right so I mean it's not really a big holiday blowout party it's really just a Christmas tree lighting that we try to tie a little bit in so we have the table and we try to really get the merchandise out so if people want to buy Christmas gifts they can come it's it's not really a blowout like the you know that I would call the Halloween thing of blowout but you know what I'm saying what the chili cook-off well so that was really good turnout for our first year absolutely right so I mean it's it's not really this holiday social isn't really meant for that it's just meant to like the big Christmas tree out front and while we want people to be there like it's it's before the meeting we did give away the beer from the chili cook up and no one really I think people drank too because they were going into a meeting so it wasn't really like no one got crazy no one got crazy yeah they got the chili cook-off people were drinking well this year they'll drink more okay so and the the next one we have is obviously in 2024 and that's the health and wellness Fair which is January Saturday January 13th and I was considering like asking what you guys think of shortening it by one hour 10 30 to 1 30 or 10 to 1 because we've had it from 10 to 2 and that last hour always is very very and that was Amber's suggestion she said if you make any suggestions about it maybe I have to cut it so just so ten to one is that good yeah okay and we can discuss more about I mean it's almost a year away I remember last year it was the same idea but then we changed it at the end we extended it yeah do you know why I don't I think maybe just if people are not available in the morning they have stuff to do but it's dragged on two years in a row and it's too long and I got like I got some information on a couple of other health and wellness fairs and they were only two hours so like even if we did 11 to one um and then we don't have to be here so early to set up that one like you were saying 10 30 to 1. yeah I'm good with anything 10 30 ones two and a half hours did you mean 130 or just do two two and a half two and a half hours okay yeah I'm good with that and we'll get into way more details about this later I just want to make sure you guys had for our four events that are currently on the books that we have to turn in this agenda so we will go through at our next meeting like you know you can look at the agenda from last year you know we can um switch some stuff around you know like we can do changes I'm just I wanted you guys have a picture in your head of what we have to present to city council to get them to vote and approve it we have a budget but that they already approved but then we have to get their approval to um like kind of break it down like event by event what's up buddy so it's we don't need to discuss at this point if I understood this uh that the Christmas tree lighting was very very close to the chili cook-off that's not what that's you mean close in day yeah closing dates yeah okay so how that happened was um so this past year it was in November and like we had a ton of people tell us Thanksgiving you're too close to Thanksgiving so the reason why we looked at a date that was open when it wasn't too hot so like you know it's um in the fall it was still kind of it's still kind of too hot to have it and then December 10th is kind of one of those things where you're over Thanksgiving but you're not really in the throes of Christmas Yet like it still feels really early and people are still like you know if you're into football you're going to be watching football that day so um that was the date when Kyle and I went through the city calendar that was open and then next we went to mayor Gaddis because it's his chili cook-off and the other thing is is that I would like to and I've talked to them about it I'm going to get your guys's feelings I can't see you saying no because all I want to do is get some of the other boards in the city involved like whether they want to participate they just want to talk to their neighbors about participating they want to donate whatever whatever they want to do like because it is it this is the park and record really helps with this but the mayor's chili cook-off this wasn't our event this was requested so this wasn't something that we came up with so we want to include the other boards and you know and they don't have to but like we would like you know and it would be a good way to get to know them better because I don't know a lot of the you mean in the City Council meetings when we're presenting like the quarterly board reports you don't really get to talk to people that much so Tammy what is our uh what is our uh planning period here we actually are we a calendar year or are we uh for these budgeting a week calendar are we a junior end or whatever what's over two budget years so we're by budget year for uh the money by budget year so October 1st to September 30th is the budget year she's got scheduled out through the rest of this pleasure year into the next 10 10 1 to 9 30. yes okay and then do you want to tell what our budget is uh currently this year is four thousand dollars for promotional events and then there's um in that same uh line item we have uh Christmas decorations and things for 2000. how much 2 000. okay and and the 4 000 for promotion is that net of ticket sales or is that net costs nothing to do with the what is budgeted for expenses that year from the city's budget yeah okay well thank you yes thank you very much yeah so from a budget standpoint I mean just so from a budget standpoint uh we're kind of so we're really setting out our time that does it's going to kind of go over oh well it's next year okay so 10 this is 10 28 of 23 so our year is 9 30. 24. is that right so we're that far ahead of it yeah we were ahead of this whole budget here so it'll be next Monday here yeah yeah exactly but we just can't but you also like so like we do and we'll get down to it we can buy things this year for next year yeah and that's what we've been doing so I just kind of look at it like you know he figures out the math and where to put it and where it goes and we just kind of we don't have to so much worry about the dates and then the merchandise like he will say it's in the budget it is not in the budget we get the like the mainline things that we want to do approved and like say like the holiday social when we did this planning we did not put um the Bellar Market catering into it you won't see it on there but we've saved money and made money at the chili cook-off so we were able to take that cushion and make the holiday social nicer so this is like not set in stone it's flexible as long as we stay within the guidelines and then also our merchandise and die so like say Kyle just we placed another order for the Bella Beach logoed hand towels okay so he's gonna go to the embroidery place and pay that bill he paid the bill on Amazon like that also comes out of here but when they're sold the money doesn't go back into this budget that's why I don't worry about the budget because it's really like the city's budget is very it's not just like line for line say if we made like four thousand dollars of the chili cook-off it doesn't go back into a budget that we can spend so like we don't even it's not like that so we just don't really I mean we obviously pay attention to like the Highlight the high lines but we don't go down into the details of it Kyle keeps track of all of that and make sure that we're all in the good so if if we can't do it it kind of gets halted before we even start the process so we don't waste our time but typically the way we've managed this out we've we look for every way to make nice events and we try not to like spend too much money and if we can make money or get some things donated then we do that and then that helps with our our bottom line yeah and so so our focus is on the activities yeah okay and then there's some other things that we have focused on but these are just the events that we do and then I'm going to go over the other things that we've been doing so like obviously this is pretty much like a newer board we can keep the same things that are working like we can take off the things that aren't working we can add things we can change things we can you know we can do what we can do like as long as we want to do the work so it's you know we there have been like when I first started this and I literally have my little notebook from my very first meeting in September of 2020 and like they were like Lynn Reeve sat me down and said Tammy you can do whatever you want you can have one meeting a quarter you can have a meeting every month you know it's up to you to run your meetings and do what you want with your board what your board wants to do um so he's like I've seen all of it in the past I've seen people that don't meet very often I've seen people that you know whatever so we can kind of do with it what we want um but these are like walking into the room today these are already the the events that are on the schedule yeah they're already set in stone so I just wanted to give you this so you had a chance to look like I already know that there was going to be like certain things that are going to be changed on this budget but I just wanted to let you see how we kind of like the things that we have to pay for like we have to pay for security we have to pay for you know you have to be at least three times a year that's what so three times a year okay and that's not very much at all no like sometimes we'll meet twice in one month if there's an event so like yes um the chili cook-off you make money on that too did that um provide you guys with a phone so I think the way we ended up with extra budget is that we press our insurance through what our typical Runners do event insurance and then I found out through the Florida Municipal Insurance trust that we could get uh better quotes through them oh that's cool they say about our insurance money and we also saved on our food because I think Tammy and I came out under on approval Budget on Costco because that's yeah it was yeah so I mean and literally like I don't know um if we made any money on the chili cook-off or not like but it really wasn't too maintenance Money Maker so yeah it wasn't a money maker because they bought the 10 ticket and got two drinks for free so it was really just a way to balance out you know whatever so so we don't really do that many fundraising activities there's more for the foundation that's the foundation yeah as the park and rec board we um we don't do any fundraising activities because the fundraising wouldn't go back towards our board at all right but it will go back to to fray the cost of the event so if you like the tickets right for this yes yes so it reduces the cost of doing the event I think the only reason we did the ten dollars for the chili cook-off is because we have never had an event that we had alcohol at and so um that is the only reason we did it and even though the foundation has the insurance for three or four events that covers alcohol a year we can't mix the two boards with an event like this so it's it's either the city's event or the foundations like if the city has an event like the health and wellness Fair like the foundation had a table there just like any other business but we weren't you know like we were just participating we weren't running it with the city so the only reason we did the ten dollars for the chili cook-off is because of the alcohol and the insurance and the permit and all the extra costs that we had never had for any other of our events did we we charge tickets we charge people come at the door too didn't we so when they came in two people came in they gave us 20 bucks yes yes right okay yeah and then you've got tickets for two drinks each for that and then the chili so and dessert so like it was we didn't charge the market I was like four or five hundred I remember it was a good Advantage yeah it was good and we're hoping for a good event this year as well like to get more people involved we're hoping the timing will lead to more people being involved we're hoping that it being on a Sunday with the football will be so yeah so we'll get into all the details of that like later because obviously it's December and it's only February and we have tons of time um but I just want to make sure everybody had the dates on your calendar and then typically what we do is we will do the setup the Friday before like we'll come in for try to keep it to two hours because the guys do all the setup of all the tables like they do all the heavy lifting for us pretty much we just have to put out the tablecloths and set up the room the way we want it can I can I set up the tables no why not why do you want to are you joking yes thank you like if you really thank you see him come in and change them man you can do all the tablecloths John hey no I'll stop the tables I'll do whatever you want I know all right so does anybody have any questions like I said you really don't even have to look at the details of this budget at all because it's old it's just so you kind of get a idea so to reiterate it's a 10 28 12 4 12 10 and January 13. yes 17 13. okay December 4th yeah yeah North December 10th yeah 10 28 12 4 12 10 and 113. I'll it'll be in the notes and it'll be in the notes okay the minutes all good okay what do we need a motion for that or no just just discussion okay um agenda item number eight discussion and review of the annual events of for the new board members so we pretty much talked about there's a couple things to add well really only one thing to add because we've kind of talked about that with it is the monthly Beach cleanup so you have all been to the beach cleanups they are the first Saturday of the month at eight a.m um I think I've missed two since we started them and like Nicole helped me so every once in a while like I said if I have a funeral if I'm out of town it hasn't happened a whole lot I will ask one of you guys to stand in for me um we are switching we have been doing the donuts every month and people are kind of got donut burn out except for you my wife is not happy with you okay so she'll be happy because you know why moving forward we're doing protein bars what protein bars 13 bars it grows whatever or granola bars so Kyle shopped at Costco and so we'll have a variety of like options and they're going to obviously be packaged and so they'll be easier like especially when it's hot out yeah yeah it's like dirty yeah we'll just put a basket of you know a selection out and we'll still have the ice water or whatever so we're switching up the treats because like people didn't even like the little muffins I was like okay well and it's okay it's just like no I don't and I get it I don't want it either I want it but I don't want it so if we have a little healthier option it might be better but it's the first Saturday of the month like I um if you guys can come great if you can't come you know the only way that you even need to let me know if you're coming or not is if like I can't be there and you're supposed to be covering for me otherwise you don't even you know I mean it's not like you have to call me and say hey I can't make it today or I mean you can you say oh my God I overslept but you don't have to I don't know exactly how uh how the residents know about the website or how to navigate the website or have what have you but like my next door neighbor moved in a month after me you know she's on the dog walking program and I just mentioned it to her today this morning as I met her on Sauron easement and she wants to come I think more people would go to that deal and so maybe some of his other deals I don't know how you get the word out to him I know we have a website but something more go just go into the website to keep yourself informed is not exactly the same as sending out an email blast and I'll tell you John when we first started we put it on the front page now too we used to have it kind of hit you have to find it now it's on the home page so we've made some adjustments yeah so to make it easier but like we we mailed out we spent twelve hundred dollars of our budget one-fourth of our budget doing one of those postcards with the dates and some info and most people were like didn't get it through the garbage I get six of those a day I don't read them so it's like that's really the only way we have to reach every resident is to do a mailer because a lot of people don't want to give their email addresses um we have if you've noticed that every event we have we have the form that you fill out to get on the city newsletter and we might get two or three at every event and people will say oh I filled it out three times and I still don't get the city newsletter and then I go I don't know I'll ask because we turn in the form so I don't I don't know what from are you still not getting it all right I think I'm getting it obviously I got that second time I get those forms does this comes in the email Patty just got thrown under the bus uh I will check so where's juglies it's pretty much a discussion constantly what you just said that's why like it's got to be like Word of Mouth neighbors we did keep Pinellas beautiful posted one time on their website we got 45 people most of them weren't from Bellaire Beach and we couldn't handle the parking and like people were you know trying to turn around in that little parking lot and then I didn't have the parking passes and we can't we can only handle like we've never been under subscribed on the um find me clean up deals so they're popular events that cost nothing to do good stuff it's a good time yeah yeah we have our crew on Saturday mornings that like come hell or high water it could be like you know freezing rain and yeah so that's so that's that's the way we do our recruiting I see Deb hey we do this good out yeah all right so it's been the most effective method yes you have to be the recruiter good yeah that sounds good oh but otherwise like those are the things that are on our schedule as far as like socials or cleanups at this moment and you know we can at our next meeting you guys want to bring the We can brainstorm or if you want to do any additions um but does anybody have any questions about any of those no okay uh agenda item number nine so sure good beach cleanups but you don't have the um uh Causeway cleanup on here because that's the foundation that's the foundation it is okay I see okay so number nine um again we don't have to talk about anything I wanted to give you the date um which um when this was originally typed up and sent to Patty we were looking at a date maybe in January or February but um it got moved to December 10th so I just the only thing I wanted to talk to you about I've already said all this that's December 10th Sunday 2023 and it's we're going to invite all the city's boards to participate and help get the information out to the community and I'm probably going to work with Patty with a letter to like I'm not going to do it in the city council meeting or whatever it's going to be a letter sent out to like the other members of the board you can also do it at the board appreciation do you know when that is April April okay April do you have a date I'll get a date Patty usually coordinates it yeah because I went to that last year and I didn't recognize 75 of the people there so um and of course we all stayed in our own little tables and only talked to the people that we know so this year I'm gonna make it a big effort to mingle um and talk about the mayor's too like actually I might have the mayor talk about the mayor's chili cook-off and have the mayor invite the other Awards because it'll be much more well received as a request coming from him than it would be from me so um that's what we'll do um the chili cook-off is it going to remain on the same platform ten dollars a person to drink tickets you know what well it's December we're going to get to that a lot harder yeah I don't know okay um but anyway so that's all we needed to really talk about today unless you guys have like a like a high-end question about it we can get into the details probably like and the reason why we don't have is because we need to get the you know we need to get the agenda like so we'll we'll talk about that when we do like we spent a good meeting on this yeah on our budget and then we pretty much just give suggestions and then Kyle gives his okay Kyle and Aaron gives their approval for what we request if that makes sense okay so just so you guys have a heads up we did a little bit this last year but for the planning for next year's health and wellness Fair like I would love to divvy it out a little bit like so like last year like Patty did like the two um like the holistic dental and the holistic chiropractor yes so like maybe like you know if you would like Dr Renner or um Pilates I know everybody has ideas and what's great about this is people are calling me now and saying can I participate like we're not going to be knocking on a lot of doors anymore but like you know and we have a lot of people that were the first one that are the second one that I absolutely expect to be at the third one and want to be here and then we like to maybe change out a couple that you know maybe they weren't that crazy about being here or they didn't really fit like our community and then just to give a few more um a few more like newer options for the people that come just so like we switch it up a little bit so is that just in the back of your mind if like she did it in two seconds just make a little list and then um it'll be like a group project which would be good so I am wondering though um do you have any literature on that that we can just like hand to someone and say yes would you like to be a part of this okay perfect we have letters from with City letterhead that pretty much I mean I sent it to you because you sent to those two people that I usually just send out okay perfect we have all of that so should I say Tammy to resend or something yeah and we'll it's next year so it's next January yeah but it's never too early to start speaking with people well you know what I did though I started really early because I wanted to get the mall Patrol you know the dermatologist with the van and I started so early in people like August I think and they're like why are you calling me now okay so it was too early and they forget so there's a sweet spot that like you do it maybe you know but you know this is the other thing Deb like for the people that we we wanted to have back when we sent the thank you letters from this year we put next year's date on it already so there a heads up okay yeah wonderful yeah so they already like if they want an early calendar we already gave it to them great yeah because they weren't available I I asked in August and they were already booked oh so are you asking though well you know what that's a good idea yeah I will email them again what is the health Health and Welfare uh fair about I mean what is it about the health and wellness Fair health and wellness for we could vendors in yep yeah especially a good vendor do you charge an admission oh yeah yeah 20 we charge 20 like 25 or 25 yeah so they the first year yeah they paid 25 to participate and then we basically provided lunch for them and then we we bought the bags with the Bellar Beach stickers on them because the first year people were walking around and they were getting all of this stuff and they had nowhere to put it so they were like a little bit more information yeah paper protein cookies like so like these people give away a ton of stuff like there were a couple of vendors that like they would literally fill the bag themselves if you want to take one of everything off their table because they buy all this marketing material and they love to be at these things and give it away and what how many vendors do we get um we only have room for 23. so like we've had 19 18 20 21. you're outside can we do that here in the big room okay that's where the chili cook-off was it's set up the same way but there's tables like everywhere and um I can send you some pictures just so you have a visual yeah you've um done it three years now right this will be the third oh this is this is gonna be the third yeah um so yeah we don't charge the residents anything but like both times we were blessed with very terrible weather like freezing first year was so cold and rainy and it's like nobody wanted to leave the cops including me this is the January event this is the January event so you never you know it could be beautiful but it's been pretty cold the last two times it was pretty this year which helped I think so and we had a lot of new faces this year that like I had never seen in other events and just so you know we don't turn anyone away like if they're not Belair Beach residents and they live in Harbor Bluffs and they're walking the bridge they're more than welcome so we don't ID people they're welcome and we've never had a problem so it's um we try to be neighborly okay so yeah we'll get into that um detailed detail later I just wanted to let you stay people that were there okay that came to the health and wellness but this is the first year not this past year who's probably not Dad I like that yes came this past year um we have some good people that come the Palms are they on here because they came this year here I'll just show him the room real quick the pond like Palms of Largo they canceled last minute last year because of um covid she got coveted she came this year she came this year Paula yeah she'll see here they have all the tables set up and people came and got information about different things they had massage people here oh yeah look how many people are all around and everything that age and everything yeah so it was very nice yeah um the hospital did like I wonder if you're making enough money on it oh yeah the hospital did a little mini um they checked your blood sugar and they did three things of course your blood pressure blood sugar they don't put your fingers so yeah we had a stretch therapist and a massage therapist there by far the busiest tables like they are busy from the time they get here to the time they leave they could be here longer but they don't they don't want to be you know okay um but anyway so you know it's a nice event and I think you know again getting the word out people like even some of the participants the healthcare participants came here thinking it was outside and they were like dressed like Eskimos I'm like oh that's something that was outside was the blood mobile yes the blood mobile is the only blood mobile really yeah okay cool yeah Tammy they it up yeah we try to get like you know because a lot of people like you move here and you're like oh I don't have a dentist oh I don't have a chiropractor oh I don't have a massage therapy you know you're looking for all that stuff I forgot about that that's right not that one that's why you move here you don't know where it is you don't you gotta find it all I had a friend we have a friend that literally for the first two years she lived here flew back to Chicago every time she went to get her teeth cleaned her hair done anything she flew back to Chicago I still have vendors up there my ears I have a I have a couple but I don't apply back for them but anyway so okay speaking of new residents um so this started the discussion started maybe like two months ago about doing oh I'll tell you how it started so we had after Hurricane Ian there was a 30-year resident that um had a share no no you don't for sure I just keep forgetting to go down in my my thing so we had um a resident that we did like they literally couldn't physically get out for for Ian um so they they moved to you know over the bridge and then blah blah blah but so you know we did a little bon voyage gift for him which I don't it's kind of hard to track the people that move but we can track the people that are new so if you want to look at this list we're going to start doing um from the city of Bellaire Beach and the park and rec board Bella Beach welcome backs for new residents so Kyle has so graciously agreed to put in so we have some extra of the white bags from the health and wellness fair with the Bellar beach sticker so we'll put it in the nice little bag and then we'll put another Bellar beach sticker in there we'll put a life is better in Bellaire Beach dish towel that's embroidered well they should be ready next week to pick up we're gonna put a little mini sunscreen a little mini SPF lip balm a Bellar Beach embroidered hand towel so you see the cost of that and then um Kyle you know there'll be a welcome letter there'll be all the appropriate Belair Beach new Resident handout like you got to get a beach pass a car sticker you need a hurricane pass to get back over the bridge if something happens you're charged for the library yeah just all the information they need as a new Resident and then um local utility contact information and then I had a meeting yesterday for the foundation with Duke Energy and she said I would love to help you with that with like storm comparison so she has um she has pamphlets like and then I've just kind of like on my own been going out when I'm out and about and I've been asking people hey like local businesses do you have any like coupons or giveaways or whatever that you would like to give in our to like let new residents know that you're here because they're always looking for new things when they get here restaurants dry cleaners blah blah yeah so this is what clean eats dropped off to put in our new Resident welcome bag oh here Publix literally gave a whole other bag of tchotchkes it's got a ton of stuff in it they're all in Kyle's office sure that's great um so like we have a couple that are pending belar Market gave some coupons sorry that's okay Coastal Market gave some information Gold's Gym gave away six free months of membership tonight that's amazing six months yeah for a little coupons so like I haven't had really any no's people are like oh my gosh I buy all this marketing material and I have a venue to give it out and you're not going to charge me so like we don't want to put too much stuff in there so I say if we keep it to like five things and no bag really has to be the same because they're not really except for the top part and the information but as far as like the little giveaways and coupons as long as we have some you know some stuff in there it's nice so we'll just kind of rotate that and keep it going and it's like you're out and about if you're out and about what is that um the light's blood sugars love does he give that I I get his notifications when his blood sugar's low yes no he's playing golf with our grandson so he's been the diabetic for whatever many thousands of years he should know to carry something it's not mine but I do check on him so um will it also contain like the packet is that when they're going to get the packet or whatever that's about getting off the island for a hurricane like the strategy and everything when they leave so they get all those papers too is it in the welcome band will they get it like somehow else yeah that's good because I think that's really important yeah and then was there a few more things that you added I couldn't find the the email with the things that like so I just kind of gave the gist there was a few more things that when he asked the people in the office like the employers yeah so it's just they're not going to be exactly the same you know the gist of it's going to be all the important information is going to be the same but it's just like a little nice welcome so it's like and say for example across the street from me like Nicole and Michael moved the house was purchased we still don't know there's they still haven't moved in they still have one thing there they so I still consider them new residents so Kyle like how do you find out about new residents you look at this house puts out a newsletter in the area and um it tells you all the sales in Bel Air Beach and the addresses so we're gonna go by that and like um but we want them to come here for the bag so we're not the okay yeah and that's are you just a dollar hanger or something yeah we like door hangers yeah that was not my favorite thing I kept thinking we were gonna get shot that was awful Dave did you know he's not gonna listen anyway so yeah but if you think of anything else but like I said they're um they're pretty much already everything's been ordered everything's been put together um probably someone in the city staff is going to put together all of the new information and like welcome packet like as far as storm and what you need in the library card and then this you know hurricane all of that like that'll be prepared by someone in the office and then yeah so and you know like what did you say the average is three a month roughly yeah so I mean it's not it's not a ton I mean but it's not like the sales now too this is usually lower than that yeah yeah it's not an overwhelming project by any means it's just once we get the gist of it set up and everything ordered it's a matter of just throwing three or four of them together so if they walk in the door you can hand it to them you're not scrambling in the back trying to put them together so it's it's not it's just a nice thing that I think is very um it's important they're getting very important information and like it's a feel-good thing it's you know I never we got one that was mostly a folder like this with all the to get the um stickers and the hurricane ticket and I think it was in a folder maybe we could get some chocolates from Dean's over there or something something nice like that just two little chocolates in the Box yeah so in that package you give them you know kind of the agenda for parks and rec for all the different events there are that we have and all that yeah and the website that's a good idea yeah very good yeah put put that in there so then at the same time here and by the way you're certainly we'd love to see it these Beach cleanup events and save and dates yeah we can put foundation stuff on there too yeah excellent I love that yeah great and then what do you think about the chocolate idea I mean it's I don't yeah I don't need the price down if we get it no I was gonna see if they just give it like the other people oh if you want to ask them yeah not to pay for it um I haven't get like there is no letter for this I haven't asked for any you know anything I understand yeah it's just kind of like a hey I sent Publix manager an email that said hey we're doing welcome bags for new residents if you have anything you want to you know throw in like a coupon or some and she gave us a ton so they'll give what they have yeah okay William Dean Palmetto's vendors just to hear you are you kidding you could stuff a a grocery bag full of stuff just with the vendors put it up here in Indiana or Bluffs Bluffs yeah public just right up there I mean it's like here we have new people coming here you want here we're going to give them this bag you want to be in this bag that's pretty much it no one has really said no even if they only want to give like a little coupon or a menu they want something in their card your business card yeah well let's let them know that they're it exists well I went to that um what is it called the coastal Market on Clearwater Largo Road where they have all of the furniture and all of that place I had I didn't find it for two years and that's what I told her I go like when people move to the beach they want to put beachy stuff in your house my wife's shop is right across the way from her canopy okay you didn't even know about it you didn't even what's your wife shot I didn't know the name of it was canopy canopy I just wrote it down I knew she had a shot right across we bought a bunch of stuff from Cold Stone Isn't it nice it's nice it's a great story there's a lot there's some very good start there's a fabulous antique store up there uh Province Andrea great yeah that street is getting like just really built up and nice and a lot of good new businesses there's another new antique uh shop up there too but yeah that's right with these welcome bags I would think there's all kinds of people that want to participate in that yeah so like like I said none of the bags have to be identical we don't want to inundate them with 75 different coupons or bags because like but we can mix them up and it like I said if you're out and about and you're just chit chatting with someone and you're waiting for your whatever to come out and you want to ask them feel free yeah because right now I want to say we have like four or five things we have enough right now to put in the bags but like it can alternate we can change it we can rotate it we can do whatever yeah good so as soon as we get the embroidery back which should be any day now we can pretty much put them together so and how will you deliver them no Kyle wants them to come to the city and pick them up that's how he goes maybe we could put a door hangers you can't give them a parking pass unless they produce their registry right plus I want them to see the city hall yeah I like it so that means you have to print door hangers too but three a month is not bad you print 100 or whatever the minimum no I was teasing about all the door hangers yeah yeah yeah that easement Circle it was way more than three those were not fun oh my gosh okay so um item number 12 review of the Bellar Beach logo merchandise so this is another thing like we in the past couple years we've tried to like the city has always had logoed hats and license plates and tennis license plates that's about what we did sure sure those were just for the um employees but like as far as selling with the residents in the last like year and a half or so when I first came in it was only hats and then the license plates came back remember because there's a request yeah Frank Baker requested the license plates again that was it okay so like we started doing this probably about a year and a half ago two years two years ago so we kind of rotate so we've done probably three orders of the large beach towels we've done hand towels we've done the little you know the little purses belly bags so yeah exactly a little fanny packs fanny packs what else have we done oh tank tops and t-shirts so that was difficult because it was hard to have all of the colors and the Styles and the sizes and designs and stock so I know Aaron mentioned like a couple things I don't really know where that stands maybe you can talk to about um maybe doing the shirts in-house I don't know if that got the box I reached out to so I use the other kind shop in terms of stuff I already shot the San Mar uh because we're a city municipality and our primary business is in the sales or I'm able to ascertain a wholesaler's license oh okay um and a resellers for events so that's that's what's holding us back um so like when we have a stack of I don't know I think they're back there but like Mary Mouse right down by Columbia that's where we're getting all the tank tops and t-shirts so you can literally go there and get your size your color your style and they'll print it for you so we weren't um they weren't giving us that big of a discount anymore and there like two for 24 or something so I think a lot of people just don't know that you could go there they think it's all like Sand Key Clearwater or Clearwater Beach but they have a lot of Bellar Beach they have stickers and they have Koozies and they have obviously about eight to ten different versions if you go you know Columbia that's right right okay it's in that it's about four doors down from Backwater yeah so in the um the same store that in the clothing store it's called Mary Mouse so it's like a very small it's a touristy like oh very thirsty they've been going out of business for six years way longer they've been going out of business forever but they're not well I I uh so that's where you go to get our branded stuff no the embroidered stuff we go somewhere else this is like the iron on like the tank tops and stuff so I wear it and that was kind of extreme yeah yeah like last year they had a truck those are transfers transfers yeah like the iron look where they yeah transfers yeah so they were like having us by 30 at a time and so we were trying to mix and match and they kept changing and the price kept changing and they they kept so it just got to be a lot so we just are like if people come in and ask we'll just go go to Mary Mouse yeah and then we just do the things that don't involve choices so like right now like I said there's beach towels back there there's license plates the hats are ordered it's still handbags they're fanny packs and the um the hand towels and stickers the hand towel should be here anytime the stickers are back there too for two dollars so I can't get one of those shirts not unless you work here is that it really only if you're working huh I don't even know the answer pretty much yeah um we could look into a better I would like to keep workingiforms looking different than what we're selling to the public um so we could do something similar I just would not want to be selling um I guess merchandise to someone could represent themselves as a city employee they have that same problem with that police that take this logo and make it sure if you really wanted to you could yeah if you had that same problem with hats no but I mean we we give those out to Public Works employees there's probably we have one that wears them um but now we haven't had that problem but they're also driving a public works truck and uh right all right beautiful because I was thinking obviously if we're if they're already making the shirts for the city then you know the price goes down they've got it all set up with the sizes they have to provide all the sizes that's all based off of quantity so the price goes down when when you have a quantity of shirts or apparel they're not going to give you a set price in sporadic orders they won't do it uh they're charged based off of how much they they bring in how much their bipinos that are in so that's how you get that press reduction okay unfortunately yeah sorry just another unique way you could do it with a shop though is looking at purchasing pre-purchasing transfers the heat transfers and I don't know shop I used to do that with the YMCA Home Depot so on and so forth but they would pre-purchase transfers and when you wanted to have an event you know or if you had a bit where you wanted to sell shirts you already had your logo you already bought it you just have to worry about getting Apparel in or having that shop whoever you're using or the apparel you've already paid for the logo that's another unique way to save money and have something you know you're not sitting on a product on a bunch of shirts you know someone wants to buy a shirt you know they'll say yeah I'll give an event coming up you need 10 shirts the other 10 levels yeah I think like just the city staff doesn't really like dealing with people buying shirts either like at the front desk it's just if you have multiple Insurance multiple sizes everybody wants to see everything yeah and it's hard to try on that's why it's just easier to send them to Marymount it's not their job and we're not really in the shirt I mean we're not really in the retail business like you said and like so if we just have like the beach towels or the fanny packs that are one size fits all one color no choice it makes it easy for everybody and we're not trying to like we're not trying to make money we're not trying to save money this is a service to the city and it has been since day one like there's a little bit of an up charge on the items to cover the taxes and the costs for yeah maybe a little overhead any little overhead but I'm talking very small yeah like no one's making any money on these it's it's a service for the residents right benefit because people are promoting the city and they're taking pride in this city I'm surprised we have any merchandise myself and we sell it it goes like and we we sell it and then we buy more we don't keep a ton of inventory like we don't buy you know thousands of dollars of stuff I mean you can go back into the store room and take a look like I'll do inventory like maybe once a month or something like that just to see or they'll call me or email me and say hey team we were out of like we had a run and I sold like you know six hats this week and so yeah you know and I know they let you know too right yeah the residents let us know that they want more they do so we feel okay they do and like like I said we kind of patted around Christmas because people want to buy Christmas gifts and the question yes ma'am the cup like this is a really not necessarily a Yeti but something like that I mean everybody in this town loves their own sippy cups I'm sure they have them but maybe ones but the Bellaire Beach might be nice too yeah no we have looked at those and we priced them and maybe it's something that we look at once all the fanny packs are gone okay that's a good idea especially you're out on your bow like they look nice yeah I just put my sticker on mine let's see I need the sticker off because like you know I probably should have never put it in the dishwasher yeah that's something see I I wanted it I wanted it see Mary Mouse on one color they were spelled correctly on another color they were spelled wrong are you serious wait a minute Belair Beach is spelled wrong I am having some trouble here what okay I'm sorry I'm doing the best I can I really did it's fine apparently not now you know you know the kind of the problem so yeah we're always just have to sell what we have because we like I said we don't keep a ton of inventory it's just like we we get rid of one thing and we bring in another and we see how it goes and if they fly off the shelves then we'll order it again right away or like we'll keep ordering it as long as um and if they don't sell fast we just take it to the next event and they said yeah we'll have we have merchandise tables at the events typically I have all my stuff yeah people like them they're like you know it's they're nice especially embroidered stuff yeah and especially like you once said when you have guests and you put them out it looks so nice it does okay so the other thing that the park and rec board does at least once or twice a year is we do Park surveys so I'm just going to talk to you about a little bit today um I think we're going to do the assignments of the park surveys for the next meeting I know it says that but I don't think we're ready to do that yet but so like we have I'm just going to read what we have we have South Park Second Street the marina Morgan Park and 7th Street 20th Street and 25th 16th and hibiscus Park East the city hall grounds and Crossman Park Belle Isle Park and 6th Street Park very miss any we have Bayside and 19th Street this seems like a lot doesn't I thought we only had 13. the uh 11 Parks 11 parks say that again City Marina City Marina and the three Bel Air Shore Beach Access well what about City Hall grounds yes that's Beach Report so 15. so 15. okay so then we just split it where you get three or four a piece parks and then we give like maybe a month or two and if you're like me you're gonna wait till the day before they're due and you're gonna go because it takes five minutes unless you ride your bike and Patty makes these nice little um stickers for us I taped that on there when I was doing those um temporary parking permit um while we're doing the surveys I just put my blinkers on it literally takes five minutes and what has worked best for us so you just kind of you you walk the park and you just look General conditions of the park what's good bad ugly and different features and benefits is to have a kayak launch does it have a dock does it have a fishing pier if it has anything what what is the state of that um feature potential improvements immediate concerns or potential danger slash issues and then what we found works best and was most effective is if you take your pictures and then email them to yourselves and then the ones that you really want to make a point on like you know the pole that got knocked over or if like the sea wall was cracking anything like that and then we just um we turned them in and then we make the packets and then everybody gives their reports and then Kyle started what a year and a half ago yes doing a recap sheet for the city employees the maintenance workers and so like they take our suggestions and he splits them into categories like what can be done immediately what needs to be voted on like I would say I mean every time someone did Morgan Park they'd say the parking lot is bad we need to repay the parking lot and the parking lot was just repaved so that would be a check mark but they're really really good about going down and then Kyle well Patty has it right there yeah this thing right yes yeah oh so it's just time to do it again so uh once a year once or twice a year we do it yeah all the hazard potentials and quick things we'll just people take care of your tax day yes can we add easements to that list sure you mean the walking easement sure yep I don't mind does anybody else mind I don't mind sometimes they get a little dangerous with the words she started I don't know the words end the the growth oh yeah yeah sure pending code enforcement okay good yeah if it's you know you're trying to walk you don't want to fall Oh you mean uh the uh The Roots yeah I've seen them spray painted pink before yellow we'll see them when I got here oh okay they sprayed the roots there's a one oh there's really one oak tree on that easement I thought there were more of it yeah it's a big one too but right it's large yeah so is this board expected or hopefully enticed to help your board I mean is this committee expected to help the foundation on different things like the beach cleanup stuff like that not the beach cleanup the yarn Bridge no it's completely your choice as a resident okay yeah yeah so this is the city's Park and Recreation boards it's a City Board and then the Bellaire Beach Community Foundation the separate energy and when they want to communicate with the city they communicate through me yeah so you you can participate as a resident but you don't have to okay as a member of the park and rec board so it's greatly appreciated though I'll make that flag um anyway is there again we'll at the next one I'll have um type up like an assignment sheet and what I like to do because like for me like we live by South Park and Second Street I'm not surveying those like I want to be like like I've over the last couple times that we've done these I've tried to get to every single Park in Beller Beach because I didn't even really know we had all these parts I didn't yeah yeah so like we like what I'll do first is I'll have you guys go I've never been to this one this one and this one and those are the ones that I'm gonna ask you to survey so you see places that you haven't seen before well you should do a field trip day and go visit the mall together together we could run our bikes or walk here go in the truck we send them back oh I think that would be very good only nothing Clearwater Beach the cocktails never hurt does uh Bel Air Beach so uh like we did that deal for the foundation we went over the uh Causeway Bridge there that's a Bel Air uh Bluffs on the other side that there so in terms of the actual cleanup of the spaces and stuff like that so we do the beach cleanup right that's us would our committee do the cleanup or so let's say for example something I see all the time that I've kind of been itchy to get after right they um the mangroves over here by the playground and my point correction I came in here okay a playground it's that way yeah right behind it that way um yeah is that right play around yeah we know where to talk no over here yeah that's right um there's a lot of debris that comes up uh it comes off of boats and what have you it goes up in that it's a messy job to clean that up uh so that's would that be the kind of thing where we do a survey and you would say you know there's debris or would we clean that up or would the city clean it up we just tell them about it we just tell them about it yeah so whoever has the city like whoever surveys the city and like the tennis courts and the mangroves that you're talking about that would be you would take pictures of like there's a ton of garbage back there and then you show the pictures and that would go on that list and that would be something if it's not dangerous it's just going to go on their work list and they'll clean it up when they're cleaning up the park normally in the mangroves typically we trim that we're allowed to trim it once a year you know they're going through there they're cleaning up the ground cover that grows and then picking up the trash um when it comes over to the uh like the Swale area that's closer to the 9th Street residence right um that gets expected monthly so when there's trash in that area it gets pulled out right just to keep the soil functioning well and what about the uh the red there's a retention Pond over there retention Pond or the county here yeah there's a retention Pond over there how about these I mean these are just as much public spaces as any other things are I think families the retention pod and the detention Pond that are part of the city hall property that that's our responsibility that's on our npds inspections um and then we uh satisfy the silk mode requirement to have an inspected by the engineer every year that is the County's pond that's all on them we maintain it like we do a park um towards the best of our ability uh to keep it nice because it is very visible coming into the city but is not our property um it was set up that way because the county will only come every six months to any pond in the county that's what they'll do so we kind of took over to keep it better so so in other words I guess my point is really anything that's kind of it's a very visible deal why why not just put it on the list and say Here's you know I pick up all these spaces yeah I know because you know Bellaire beats the Bel Air Shore properties aren't ours but their world ones that use it so right I got you okay and the same token um we should probably invite the Bel Air Bluffs people to come out and do the bridge with us how about clean the beach with us well see we do and Nicole does the postings and it comes from Harbor Bluffs so like Nicole's posting from that side of the bridge so they get it as well as us what is it the people on the beach called what are they called Bella Shore Bella Shores I thought you're talking about the bridge cleanup you're talking about the beach cleanup yeah I mean yeah you know they don't even want us on the beach really and we're cleaning it I would say that like when we're out there cleaning the beach the people in Bel Air Shores nine times out of ten if they're out there we'll come say thank you like I don't think it's everyone I think there are a couple of people who are you know squeaky will louder than everyone else that make it seem like they meaning all of Bella sure I don't I I can't see anybody any resident there saying I don't want you on my beach cleaning it like so I don't know how in my experience I would agree because when I've been out there ranking because we also will rake Feller Shore um their residents will come out and thank me more that more so than anywhere in dollar Beach so they do what they are appreciative of what we do you're raking in the past is it there is uh when you have construction too I mean I don't know whose responsibility is but some of those lots are empty and I have cleaned up a uh somebody was living there like a homeless person yeah well it was a homeless person right so a homeless person uh was living there's that empty lot on oh what is it like is it 12th or 13th and there was like a plastic a non-bill or shore on the gulf on the Gulf side so there was a homeless person living right below the sea wall perfect spot there's just all right that's what uh that's right why not I mean if you're homeless be crazy not to but so you know showers and everything that's that's what um what's her name smart homeless person the Colucci that's the yeah um said there were several there and they said yeah they got free showers you know toilets and everything all right yeah so yeah I don't mind adding so I'll work with Kyle and we'll add all of the market easements and the Retention Ponds like the Retention Ponds will like that one we've never had but the one that's on the city hall property would pretty much go with whoever Scott's City Hall to serve it well I mean like I say if that one there was garbage around it I when people come into the city that's what they see that's what they see this and that and we don't want that all right so now you guys have a juice of what we do so I'll get the the overall list together and then I'll just type up the couple of questions and then um short instructions and then Patty will send it out to everybody with the next agenda and then we can just like I said go around and you can go I want this one and I want that one and I've done them all pretty much up until this point so like you guys pick what you want and then I'll take whatever's left so and then they'll like I said they'll be due like the next month or the month after that it's we'll decide on a due date actually try to get what try to get each individual deal once a year twice a year twice a year twice twice a year yeah at least twice all right but then you know it's like I you know if you live by a park like I'm always calling especially on South Park because there's you know if you're there and you're walking past it with your dog and there's an issue then you call and just say hey this is broken or this has been knocked down or this is you know whatever if you're out and about like you do it as a resident anyway so like um you know it's like they don't know what they don't know we don't tell them they'll never know well it just seems if you're going to go out there though to me just if there's if there's a couple items of trash to pick up or something like that I mean I don't see the point in going out there not picking up the trash let me say there's trash out here but you know here I'm right here call it them and I go we don't pick up the trash if we go out to a place are you talking about the surveys I'm talking about the survey yeah can pick up the trash if you want I would tell you that 99 of the time there's been no garbage in any of them I believe it yeah there really hasn't especially like on like the inner part of the city um there just hasn't been but I mean if there is and you want to pick it up you absolutely can okay there is there is trash on easement s yeah it isn't like these because of the roots no she just can't walk that far and she doesn't like her feet getting wet and dirty oh yeah I'm supposed to pick up my dog so that it doesn't get all dirty on easement that's what I'm supposed to do that's what you're supposed to do oh my goodness so that's true so I know okay does anybody have any about the the park surveys well before the after everybody give me a list so I can ride yeah we're gonna type up a list okay and then send it out and then you can you'll have it before our next meeting okay a generator number 14. other business does anybody have any not really the only thing I forgot to mention when I could have mentioned earlier so um in regards to the beach cleanup so Kyle and I for two years in a row have gone to the keep Pinellas beautiful thank you because we do both the foundation does the bridge and Bellar Beach does the beach cleanups through keep Pinellas beautiful so they're the ones that provide all of the stuff and then after you do the event there's you know you have the liability form that everybody fills out and then there's an event recap um that you have to fill out it's real easy like how many people how many kids how many adults how much trash did you pick up how long was it was there a training I'm like yes I get the Barefoot training every month that you're Barefoot safety I did so um so like we you know so they do a little impact report so you see Bellar beaches number um two under the city we're not like second overall no we're not talking to yourself thank you for appointing that out but we're still on there what is it it's just how much we report so like on the recap that you send in they total it for the whole year and then they put it in the annual report so how did we care against other towns I wanted I tried scanning that so I guess it's KTV it was hard the fun of it I just never had enough time I wanted to see Keith Pinellas yeah it's a smaller version of keep America beautiful it's a it's not a smaller room no it's a it's alphabetical Oh shoot what is it called [Laughter] two months of beach cleanup you got well it's only an hour each time yeah but you have to have 15 20 people out there every time so I wait on the week or no hours I'm kind of competitive guy do you want to fill out the forms from now on you can put whatever what do we get if we win I don't think it was a game well look if somebody's going to spend the money to put together this glossy and all this thing I mean right huh I'm just trying to figure out how it works you study and figure out how we can move you can just you know you can give a pep talk the next Beach cleanup I think all right I think that in your in our new Resident package you should have that thing in there and point out that we're second on this bill and somebody will just read right past and they want to see that it's an alphabetical order of each second on the list behind Bel Air it was biller guys beat us again and then you have that okay this is pretty nice well I mean people know this exists keep Pinellas beautiful or that book this book this year yeah they didn't do them last year they got some big sponsors and so they did a very nice thank you they got Coca-Cola and Seagram's sponsors wow so they got some cash they're growing yes they're growing and very very nice people yeah mm-hmm cool yeah look at this yeah the more money they have the more they can do just like everyone and yeah so okay sometimes I just want to show you guys that because it's nice and then um our last I agenda item is next meeting date so would you would you guys like to pick it you'd like me to put two or three dates together and have Patty send them out for March maybe we could discuss two or three dates and then have yeah we can do it right now March filling up do Thursdays work well for the most part Thursday two o'clock Tuesdays and Thursdays are good for me okay truth tastes better for me but you say Thursday you can do Tuesday Thursday Tuesday is better you're indifferent John or Tuesday is good for you uh uh actually yeah Tuesdays in the afternoons are fine but sore Thursday so okay okay so why don't we how about Tuesday um March 14th it's a good day at two o'clock Tuesday March 14th okay does that work for everybody yeah okay don't see anything on that date right now awesome that's not during spring break is it well it depends because the spring breaks are all over the board like I know my son is here the following week and then we have other family that are on spring break the week after that so it just depends on where they they're coming from so it could be spring break for somebody it probably is it is but I don't know so all right we don't have to vote on that right everybody's just in agreement that Tuesday yeah the 14th at 2 p.m is good okay and then I will make a motion for adjournment May I have a second second all in favor all right all right so adjourned"
