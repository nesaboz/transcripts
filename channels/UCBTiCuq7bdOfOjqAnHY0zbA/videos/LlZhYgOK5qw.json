them you guys look at them a second all right yeah there was um I noticed afterwards and I I think she may have uh let me look at one quick thing I'm sorry yeah so the there there was one modification I'll make sure that um Renee gets this I sent it to her but um on the April 25th sure okay let me see all right the April 25th meeting which was our last meeting mhm it says uh approval of the February 27 that actually should say March 21st okay so you made the change already yeah so that should say March 21st and then in the motion itself it should also say instead of 227 it should say 3:21 okay gotcha but other than that everything was as as discussed I do it too all the time okay all [Applause] all right we have a citizen for Citizens comments yay I'm so excited I had asked for copies of his of different artwork there's stuff in there yeah in the packet it's all in the pack okay okay okay please John well let me see I wasn't quite sure where we are well I just printed a bunch of things so we can all kind of say hey we like this we don't like this and you know I thought maybe you could get ideas from that's all I need like really an idea is you guys give me what I mean we are we set on the amount per wall um cuz you guys give me what you want and that's I mean ni I mean we really wanted the three walls but it's coming out of our budget so for it to come out of our budget means like we don't give the citizens any events this year but we're painting the building so um I don't know like which will be an event that'll last forever yeah that's true temporary event but um yeah I mean as far as you know L I know that you want to do one that face that facing wall first right on the street facing the street moving those signs yes yeah Aaron said the signs will be moved and then I know you want to do just if I'm wrong so um let me know but you want to do like belir Beach something like welcome to belir Beach and that's you know we right that was something we were talking about and after we talked about it I went down there and looked again it is a teeny tiny wall teeny tiny to put to put put welcome to B some kind of picture it's going to be it's going to take over like the whole welcome to belir beach let's not do it I mean you could maybe put b beach on it you I'd have to reassess it now cuz I I went down what month and a half or so scha took pictures of it I've got pictures of the wall um but what I could do once we get and then something like that if you have the lettering then you don't really want a whole lot of busy you know I don't know I think maybe in your I don't know I would go back to the idea I didn't realize it was so small I I didn't B biggest wall seems like the one facing the beachs but it's it's a square all of is about the same square I think it's just is there a window let me see what about if we just did like Belair Beach coming up like like vertical vertical and then you could still do something like this beautiful Turtle underneath or something or something I just listen you should show them your work that's what you should do and why don't we go from there did you bring like a bigger scre no I was not prepared for this meeting I had no idea what you guys were going through that's okay why don't you show your phone you know gra I mean what I can do I mean your best bet is to like any you guys ever been to my website um 99 shades of crazy.com sounds about right that's 99 shades are crazy and and you know there's also the Facebook 99 shades are crazy that has a lot of my current stuff but the website's pretty current as well um I mean but on there you'll be able to see it I've done just about can you show them your mermaid like that one on the Rock just yeah and then just sh put your camera sideways and show it yeah I mean this this is just one I'm working on now so he's doing a um mural for belir Bluffs it's a house a huge house but that is magnificent and see I I like this picture yeah see it goes It goes all the way around all the way over but you putle there like there's a nest there if we're going to spend all the money to pain I think I want more than that honestly you know what I'm saying but it's just it'll curl if it's that or a little more he's still going to charge us the same price but we could ask him about that that's exactly why P here yeah I still got to add stuff on that one but you can see it curls all the way around like I really like this this is pretty you know it doesn't necessarily have to be in the evening he can make it a day more of a day is it's on the house go signies of this smaller wall and I love these Turtles I love the turtles well the turtles was my first healthy on my 59y old body playing on there oh yeah you look terrible but you can see but that has a lot of the website has a lot of my personal artwork that you can see this is my favorite guy I like that one yeah and the turtle I mean I think the turtle would be awesome on that facing wall that's what I think something like that she was saying something like just grassy and I was like you really wanted to be well I said with a turtle mask right there you said with a little turtle right there that's what you said Turtle we're talking about different Turtles follow me don't you some some of it I have yeah I mean the the one I'm doing now I mean I've been doing it since November yeah you told me you've been working on it so long like 40,000 squ ft or something house yeah the house 14,000 do you like it it's really good yeah super decent and like literally we show this is don't have money for super detail well I mean but I listen I'll give you guys like I'm I'm I'm honored to be able to do something on the beach you know like um I at have I come across the you could watch me I'm very used to people watching me but um you know we get set what we say 1,500 bucks a wall I I mean I'll put anything you want on it that's I mean these guys that's what I told them we got set on a price once I started doing a a mural like this it's like once I dig in I'm going to just do it to where it looks good cuz it's got my name on it you know so any kind of detail on it I got no problem you know throwing them in maybe Patty was thinking like something a little less work would be maybe less price and I didn't want it too too busy cuz it's so tiny for sure so anybody know about the dimensions I don't know it is it say about 10 by 8 10 by 8 that's what I thought it was like a 10 by 10 I thought it was a square see down a whole long this is house where I'm it's all underwater and this way walls you know north south walls and eest yeah come over the bridge you can see you can see the whole thing when you come over the bridge they're going crazy telling anything and everything want on South has the two bathroom doors he's not going to the do he's not going to put the how about something like this on the front wall it's subtle gosh I think the Dolphins would be good on the back wall see face in the water okay I'm okay don't you face in the water yeah I mean that would be cool I'm okay with that I just happened Patty was saying she didn't want it to be such bright colors but I mean we could always I mean I could I I could do if we did just the beach scene little something simple I have no problem doing it for Less I have no problem with that if it's going to take me less time I'm not here to gouge you know I'm here to get something up there that you guys love that I can put my name on and look good and one of the um I like this maybe in between the bathroom doors [Applause] [Laughter] pictures awesome stuff but yeah I mean if you if you look up 99 Shades crazy you be able to see got right 99 99 shades of crazy okay on the AI that you sent us that were just like they look like pencil drawings on the door side you just had a few palm trees yeah didn't touch the doors right was between them and I thought that was coming too I got those right here let me pull them up we had a wonderful world of AI was Aaron today he's sick oh okay um I think so he probably be back tomorrow him rest up that's what Lloyd said too you don't need to go to that meeting I said yes John the muralist is coming I want to meet him must meet well thanks for coming hey I appreciate it I I said I've been I had four classes this last week on the beach um he came to a friend's house came to a friend's house yeah and had seven drunk women to teach I got walking in she's holding the phone she's going Here Comes Your mermaid stripper and I'm like she's like where's your outfit I'm like I guess I missed that mem yeah you know the birthday girls never knew what we were planning yeah there was one one just the tree that one had like little flamingos but yeah that had I like that one a lot that was myv yeah me too I mean I really love that one I don't know background because it's got that pretty blue on it well yeah well there's blend in it there's just blend so yeah I would definitely probably go in and do different blends of blue I like how the Sun is up there making my favorite right here for the door wall do you guys see this yeah maybe we should um this is the one she's talking about that I did with AI just can throw it on so this you know what we can do is I mean there's time I guess if we're just doing one wall at a time to figure out which one you wanted but um you know the I love the idea that turtle on the front that's going to be a ey catcher I mean I think in a perfect world if we can get all one of be look how pretty like um one of these turt bathroom there's another one with just the blue that's my favorite that's what they painted the other night and then I like these two whatever I saw it had it earlier like this guy and something not as dark like I would probably just do the turtle you know cuz that's pretty dark I don't know if yeah maybe put him like in a lighter background like a beach next to him better you like the turtle next to him better this one you're talking about I mean they're both they're all gorgeous I don't think we go wrong with any well if you flip the page there's three Turtles actually in motion so this they were like flipping up and down see although a stingray do you have any stingrays oh I was out there that's the best part it's not in the water my and we're just you know talking sudden he came out of the water and did that kapow down to me my husband saw the same thing I just did this s on the mural did you see it was at least 5T wide one on the M oh my word I love it I love that that should be on the other side I love it that's magnificent just that's one I put on the mural today turtle and today I mean that looks like a real it is it's a photo it's not me I didn't paint it it's a photo it's a photo reference that I used paint yeah I just painted it today if it didn't get washed off by the storm I I love that yeah so I think I mean where were you painting okay so that big mural at the house yeah so so far Everyone likes the stingray and Everyone likes the turkey one Turtle somewhere and Everyone likes the palm trees yeah and that would be nice it would just be like you know that that blue and the sand you know and you may even have a little somewhere to play with the the Beller beachs if you still wanted to identify with some kind of lettering you know gu see your layout yeah because you know it's course taller and the mermaid's pretty pretty short so I think there's definitely room where you could even if you didn't have to put welcome to beach would be nice um what was I just going to ask you about um oh will you now that we're kind of like deciding what we like the same way you AI generated the middle panel could maybe you could do that and play with letters and see well I'll just do that by hand AI doesn't listen that good oh okay I wish okay and maybe like get a sketch of what maybe that turtle that type of like fun turtle on a lighter Sandy Beach here well what I'll do is I'll just I'll just do some sketches you know probably won't be any coloring okay um just some sketches so you see the basic layout um we kind of know what the the Le coloring is going to be okay um but of course before we do each wall I'll be able to make sure I let you guys know exactly so there's no surprises you know and then and then we can get a more exact price and what have yeah and then I can do I'll just do the sketch I mean I don't know what you guys as far as looking when you want to do it I mean I'm probably available to start in a couple weeks well def I wanted it last November yesterday so um that's not uncom I mean I think we have some money to move forward right yeah we have money in the budget can get started and we can move signs we want to show it once to council right just kind of yeah they said they need to say a okay okay so once he sends us the AI generated NOP no AI um once he hand the potential design which could change just an idea semi design with the price saying now that I know how much work this is what it's going to cost they have to take it to city council to get it approved which is in a couple of weeks yeah when is the next meeting the first uh sixth sixth yeah the 6th of June well that's perfect then so I just get a sketch together for that front wall with this one with the lettering and um and the palm trees in the middle on the middle wall yeah and well well you want me to get all the three walls set yeah we only want to go to them okay I see so what you're going to do is get go to them for the approval and then we'll just take it in the stages I got that works for you okay yeah that's fine okay I mean I can appreciate I can appreciate doing that so so we pretty much we've got the The Palms for around the trees or doors right that one's pretty much one yeah that one that one's really nice I think that would be really John you like that one hello John are you there and then the back one were you thinking like the Dolphins oh the Stingray well I thought that's the front Oh I thought the turtle was the front yeah okay see now I know why you guys have these meetings no okay yeah so the turtle in the front sting right back but the turtle you want to belir beach on the front facing the street right okay so yeah so should the turtle be in the water or in the sand dunes well he's swimming he swim he'll be underw you if I have a choice of course you have a choice I really really like like um this water like this look right here like if he's just maybe you know like this really transparent green that we see in this pretty beautiful sand so something where he's like coming up on that so he's like maybe still part in the water coming you could add grass or you could add shells or whatever stuff this is you know I don't care but well right well I mean we can we can do a that' be like a collage kind of no I'm just saying where it's he's on a a more of a light background like this instead of where he oh no yeah for sure I was saying earlier you don't want to do that back that's all I was saying I'd like him to like almost look like he's half in water half on the sand he's just beautiful dab but I think he'd almost have to be like all underwater okay well cuz it would change the perspective as all if he's underwater and on the S and yeah like if you see this guy almost like be Fring this guy is nice because he has the Sun for sure he's the one she's talking about he's the one that I put on that big mural this one I don't know I personally think he doesn't have enough color I I oh well he can add color this is what he was saying this is like the in the shallow water like he were talking about that's why the but he can make the water more blue right mhm yeah what about like something like this where the sun is actually coming through the water John right I like that this one yeah like this in here where I just did let me show you hold on yes that's it Patty check mark on that one so so the water's coming through and I don't that's a nice Turtle too you know but they're all pretty yeah just I just happen to like the colors especially if it's going to be on the wall I think it will pop but he can honestly do anything that he thinks is going to be best yeah as long as you guys get but you know or just just something where the sun's coming oh my goodness show her yeah even the shell has color look at that like just you know just like where it's the little rays of sun is coming down that's sun and shell in the color all together which one the bottom no the one we C this one yeah put check more by yeah how about him that turtle with that what's it maybe that background I like it Turtle blue and green that turtle with this backr turtle with this background that's easy enough yeah okay or I like that turtle on the background I mean it's real close I mean you just do the same it's already starting to have the Rays in have a little bit of ground down here you can maybe throw a couple little crabs walking the FR you know what I mean just something a little I got a little bit I like that little what's happening I'm going to go sit down there like this cuz I yeah just I can't draw make sure you get that Turtle to me I sure will somehow and then and that's the one with the it's also the one that's going to say yeah that's the one that's going to have Bel Air Beach on it top of it if you can't do if you can't like even if it's you know if it you can't you can't but it could even be you know coming down a side or don't run the picture just leave it and and then uh the Dolphins no the stingray that you have oh that's right why did I say Dolphins so the back is a Sr my Stingray I got it now so is it big enough the stingray for the back and in other words we're going to have that whole back be one Stingray well the layout of the stingray won't allow it to be the whole wall because it's flat it'll be nice and W so you're going to have uh like the option of just just water in the depth of the water which I think is very impactful I really do the colors wise you know you can go from lighter to darker that's going to help accent cuz stingrays aren't colorful you know they're gray could you add other stingrays like sometimes I know he's the center Stingray you could maybe have like a couple or a few like a silhouetted silhouetted like you know how they always have like they a their Shadows not a squad but like better can be the if you like the Dolphins better it can be the Dolphins uh does anybody have a preference I I I like the stingray picture but I know you can do a great job on the Dolphins too you have any dophins to show us that you've done and the I mean what's you know so I know we've had a couple of sightings of the manor rare or whatever but you know I see dolphins all of the time it's much more indicative of what's really out there I've got a yeah I've got a dolphin layout I did for thank you about the yeah right yeah yeah yeah I mean I see dolphins all day long at my house but you're on the back side yeah I see them I'm on this side I see them yeah and I see sting rce I see manatees I see everything the manatees but they would not make a pretty oh not not pretty I see both sides like move you can put that ugly guy on there let me see show yeah no no no only men on our thing men with teeth like that it wasn't a woman fix long before that that's a request that's all all right where I'm like my word babies because I leave on Saturday yeah oh which reminds me if you guys have to reach me I'll be pretty out of commission but I will be able to see my emails when I have um Wi-Fi so if you need an approval like Midway after the since I'm not going to be back like let's say after the um council meeting and you want to say okay we do we want to move ahead I'll be back June 9th so it's not that much of a difference I think he said it's June 3rd but if he's ready to work and he's ready to work then put it this way you have my approval I'm I'm voting yes to move forward if the council says yeah if the council's on board I'm on board yeah I'll make sure that I mean you guys I'll get it laid out and sketched and you guys just take it from there but I mean I can I'll work with you on is this an extra copy whatever lay is I gave in mine but just so he has the artwork yeah I've got the turtle oh you gave him you can have and I got the sting so why don't you give him all the um little drawings anyway and then I'll give you this new packet there you go John you have them all where I ripped off the bottom and gave you directions so front front wall we're looking at turtle with the sun rays coming through the water in the berair beach right above for the back wall we're talking Stingray or Dolphins still M up in the air and then the bathrooms the palm trees right yep exactly with the sun yeah got the cute little color sun right there in the middle yeah isn't this exciting I had a dolphin that I do you put any kind of like coating over how's it for oh yeah any kind I I use exterior latex just like a regular house paint you know so it lasts that long but I always tell everybody to put you know clear coated with like a just a cement sealer it's a clear like you would to do your driveway or something like that do we do that oh you you could it' be fine once for with with the paint itself being real good I always use like a Sherin Williams exterior latex okay so that stuff's really good plus you throw that on top that be good for 20 years before you'd have to do it again yeah so we don't want a what kind of Co it's just a like a a cement sealer you know you would do on a driveway or gotcha getting ready to do this on the bottom of a boat on the bottom of a boat for to Plum well it's no it's actually it's going to be sitting in somebody's yard um wait I'm confused it's a bottom of aat yeah it's like a big dingy guy down there he has all kinds of like well you guys probably know no Todd plumbley you know the plumy I don't know where live right ending rocks beats with the plum is plumble reality okay you probably see that all the time you can't have a boat no oh yeah they what this is is this like a dingy boat like a 8ft dingy boat that they had in Forever Beau colors are crazy yeah that's kind of insane yes is he just standing it up or something or yeah sits in his backyard it's a decoration boat yeah I know how's anybody going see it right yeah not in the water I was hoping to see this one let me see it's sting ra see shs but I can do that you know I mean that's probably a good way to get it started you know if you want I can maybe uh do one quick with some Dolphins just for if you guys are undecided on the one face in the water via Dophin you could do that so we could take it let the council decide yeah dolphins or sting there's always going to be people I love this I love that I like dolphins better than sting I'm I mean we got that with four people my life well they don't have but four people true have a tie move forward you get to break you get to break the tie then I'll go the arm of one of them and say make a decision all over the art Okay so show you so the date um so the the idea is that we're going to have the sketch concepts by the June 3rd council meeting yeah uh so what's your time frame so we can so I think we've already kind of decided Deb's already voted um so we're just going to present what you share but what what's your kind of Target date Target dat I don't in minutes in the prepack it you know what I'm saying get in the prepack I'll need it um very latest by Thursday this Thursday no Thursday before so Thursday the 30th okay can you get that by

to well that's why we wanted it done earlier because of how man I can appreciate contact you're out there talk course they do all the time yeah no that's something that you get used to um but I'm used to people you and I did Art therapy for 20 years and then this I've been doing the sunset stuff for got 7 years now on the beach where I I don't know if she told you but I do it's called sunsets by brush like everybody comes out it's like paint nights but they do it right on the beach for caddies I do it at caddies I do it at Indie rocks Clear Water Beach Clear Water beach every Friday Indie rocks every Saturday yeah but it's um I even did two live Zoom with on the Weather Channel which was unnerving I had no idea that many people watched The Weather Channel other than when there's a hurricane look at it every day that's it just five minutes and that's all want to know but for people going by that's yeah that's no big deal to be on the beach he puts up to these nice tents here this is what his painting classes look like and we met him several years ago taking the class and I followed his work ever since because it's just kind of cool you know so yeah it's a really neat experience and like I said he worked his way he went out there he tried it got in trouble realized he needed permits in every town he does well Indian Rocks Beach didn't allow commercial businesses on the beach and I bought $450 worth of permits like Community Gathering County city state whatever and I had 18 people lined up I'm like yeah and as soon as everybody's getting ready start here come three cops over the boardwalk an SUV with the lights on down the beach I thought somebody lost their kid and um they kep rolling right up they're like are you John comr and I'm like yeah they're like do you have a permit I said yeah and I showed him he goes no ending Rock beach permit and I go why didn't didn't show me on sun Biz you know you go on sun Biz you know what you need you think you get everything you need so it took me four months um but I started doing classes cuz I bought all this stuff I spent like four grand on stuff and um I started teaching in 18 on the rocks that bar and uh the commissioner who called the police on me was in there with his wife eating and Nancy the manager or the owner she said the commissioner's here that shut you down do you want me to introduce you to him and I said absolutely so I go up and he goes she goes this is John local artist he's got stuff hanging here and murals she goes and he also used to do the sunsets classes on the beach and he just went and his wife goes that was you she goes we argued about that for a month and he shut you down cuz they shut down the the yoga girl too and uh so he's like they're waiting on you y they're waiting on you go to City Hall so so it worked out used do it on Wednesdays and Saturdays nothing they just yeah they knew I was coming I just went and filled it out almost went to jail yeah after that after that it was pretty cool because the you know that was during Co and um the cops were patrolling the beach they would come and hang out right at 21st Avenue beach access and stand there and watch the class but so I feel like I know a bunch of the cops that's in a good way starting off yeah that was the worst case of anxiety I think I've ever had in my life 18 people going what are we going to do I'm like well we can't do it here we got to do it somewhere else come on to my house yeah well that's what they did yeah they had me go to this condo right on the beach that nobody was at and we did it around the swimming pool still still did the class but it took me wants to do it yeah hey got always Solutions right yeah all right is it time for us to get back to business y thank you you got me

sure you're happy with the work thank you give a h that's not the right way go figure they'll send him out all right thank you thank you he's going pay off this yeah he's funny guy very nice very nice K okay well in that episode I think we took care of four five and six no um so I think four if I'm not mistaken four was none five was the discussion of the mural and we had John comr as a guest so we moved him up I guess you see what I'm saying I don't think we really had we didn't have any citizen comments cuz he was here specifically yeah he's not a citizen of and then I believe number six is followup on Mrs cers well that's six and seven right I know I had classes yeah probably so yeah who's item six what's her name Mrs whoer in the notes um so I don't know what we need to discuss about her we talked about it so much last we she wants that community garden but she has no interest in in participating in it she doesn't she just wants us to do it well she just wanted to bring cuz I talked to her afterwards she just wanted to bring the idea in the resource to see if you got if anyone was interested okay but I told her you know if we were to do something like this we' have to have somebody who was really interested that was going to yeah to handle it you got you I think that's what she wanted from us she wanted this group to be the one that handled it right you know and well but it wasn't like you know it was if if if you were interested she wanted to introduce you to the wait there is yes sir you can hear me I got the feedback I don't know what happened okay we're glad you're here okay I've been I've been here the whole time except for the last minute and a half oh perfect great um what was I going to say what were we just talking about Miss Glazer and who's in charge so I wonder if we can put out like to the community is anyone interested in starting a community Farm if we Grant you some land and kind of spearheading it well and that's the other thing she had was like a market that's easy that's very easy oh like a fresh market yeah just like one hour one Saturday a month or yeah and just whoever's got too many mangoes avocados or whatever comes up here and exchange with other people or sales a neighbor neighbor um fresh that was her other idea fresh produce exchange yes or something so it was two different two totally different ideas one she wants to get rid of her mangoes or we just put something in the newsletter that says hey if you guys have extra fruit bring the baskets to City Hall and we'll keep them inside or something I don't want you to get W but you know what I'm saying not a lot and people could stop by or on Tuesday we're going to put them outside everybody come on Tuesday if you want the community stuff right I don't know like do we have to have a meeting point for it can't we just say if you have Surplus mangoes yeah or fruit somebody looking for mangoes no that was how this started she had hundreds of mangoes and so did her neighbors and they don't know what to do with them and it's wasteful it's wasteful and it causes to to many you want them on the ground yeah so you want you want to enjoy them and you know gosh they're so expensive and why shouldn't we all enjoy them if it's for free you know and that's what she was saying and you know you want mangles do I like them do you want them I would want them if somebody was giv for free oh yeah there avocados avocados those things are so yeah yeah I mean these things are growing here and they're expensive you have grapefruits she said something like they had I don't know all these grapefruits on the tree you get to the point where if it's a good Bloom I mean you could get a hundred mhm you know depending on your trees yeah and like how much jelly do you need like you have to say those two iide did sorry do we have to take that to the council also well I guess it depends on how we do it um do you just ask them their feelings about it or do they see a possibility of either one of those things I would personally just check and with um with Randy you know about what we're doing what we're proposing do we have any examples that they do around here similar I don't know any you know I know the big Market in St Pete with the fr the fresh you're thinking like like an hour a week kind of like a produce exchange or what do you call almost like a farmer's market but you're not selling it yeah produce exchange it could be I mean they could sell it couldn't they I don't know is that is that cause interference if they're selling in the parking lot I don't think you give me three mang I'll give you four food no you can't sell food okay yeah you got to have a license yeah then a prodest exchange proce exchange are produce how do we guarantee that people are going to bring produce cuz lot of people show when there's no produce well that's why I'm saying maybe we put it in the newsletter and say to people if we did um produce exchange would you be interested in participating I mean I guess and I would say it would need to be a week end like a Saturday morning 8 to 9 9 to 10 something like that nothing any longer than an hour you have stuff you bring it nobody shows you got to get your butt home and we were talking maybe one afternoon like 4:00 or something maybe not on the weekend when your parking lot's not used as much like on the weekend you have a lot of guests here so right well that's why I said morning yeah early morning early morning because there's not going to be any weddings going on that's a great idea early morning is perfect now is that does anyone go to be there I mean is it like beach clean up or someone else to be there I guess I don't know that's what we're throwing out to you and asking questions are you asking us if any of us would like to manhandle it my answer is no I don't have produce I buy mine so yeah I don't have any there would be no reason for me to be involved but again we either of these projects are great ideas but we need a spirit head on them in with everything on our plates I don't think we could add more that's what I thing yeah you got to have it's almost like if someone takes an idea they got to be you know somewhat yeah they need to be involved in it yeah yeah I mean it was a lot of information PR cuz I I didn't that wasn't my takeaway that she didn't want to be involved but I mean it's a lot to drop on after yeah it's a lot to drop on us to be like hey here here's here it is nobody knows anything about it but go implement it right which is why she provided the information start things like that and then they get sort of aband then what do you do throw it all out well um I guess maybe just mention it to council and say this is a citizen request and we wanted to know they know all about her don't they yes they sent her to us but it is what it is she's she's not a well woman so that might be the reason she can spearheaded because she has that sound like she had a lot of problems problems yeah so you know there's probably days you can't predict how you're going to feel if you could get out or whatever the case is so mhm what about um like events I know you guys want to kind of switch it up but what are you guys thinking for what if we're going to do the mural I guess that's going to be the rest of our budget we're planning till October 1 but I know you guys were talking like different ideas so um what kind of change up what you think I me well is is John I know John want to do the he was excited about the chili yeah me too that's what I going say I really like the chili cook off as well I and I don't think it's an enormous cost to us we just have to manage it and I don't mind helping with that we had then we had to pop beer or one yeah yeah we sold it I know we had tickets Raffles um we did um but depending on the size it's almost easier to just buy it and just have it available yeah I think so too because it the process of getting the insurance and the license just to sell it is not not really worth it because you're not actually and you know what money say so let's say we charge everyone maybe $10 or $15 to come in the chili cook for if you're putting um a chili in and you have an opportunity to win maybe maybe the registration fee for them is a little higher to come in and register your chili I don't know just talking if you got decent prizes yeah and then or like last year they gave that big Budweiser paddle board and everything that was amazing well I got a really nice cooler and two yeah chairs so what I'm saying is if you have an opportunity to win a a really good gift like that maybe they pay 25 and our guest coming in Pay 10 and then it's included with beer and wine and how much and water because last year I think people had to buy water and they weren't happy about that I can't remember if we were selling it or handing it out because I worked the we might have selling it but again typically with our events it's a small budget to provide free water yeah I think we should free water I don't think we should be maybe one thing a diet pop or something whatever they call that in New York it's soda so there okay um so so what were you thinking of any other events no I just I I just want to kind of be able to have an idea for the budget and start thinking about dates because you know things f up right so what about I mean do you think we need to continue the Pets and Pals or whatever it's called you know I mean the pets aspect of it is probably more popular for Val Beach um but it's taking a year off is okay you know what I mean if if you want to bring it back you it's not like we have to do the same thing every year yeah I was thinking what about that thing I've been speaking to Aaron about I was really excited about it is having um like remember I keep talking about having the firemen come cook for us and everything and he thought we could maybe turn it into just like safety yeah kind of safety but more like have all like meet your community protectors and US kind of like go in and meet all the cops and the sh sheriff and the Fire Department fire department and police would participate for sure yeah cuz I was like maybe they could barbecue even if it's just hamburgers and hot dogs or whatever and we can buy chicken salad not chicken salad potato salad and just have like um like you said Community First Responders yes I like that a lot I like it a lot too okay so what a DAT so we can get them on and then that's what we do we wait till the end of the year we do everything well why don't we do this in like um maybe the beginning of September which one the first responder yeah this way it's just getting cool the kids are going back to school we could do it get the fire trucks here like you know have kids walk inside a fire truck or an ambulance we don't have a lot of kids I know but you know what I mean and then do the chili cook off call that around November when it's kind of football season right cool should we wait should we do cuz it seems like we when we wait too late in it gets too close to the holidays M so um I know that we're playing like that veterans thing in November so maybe October is better cuz it's still football it's just not too before you get into the heavy so maybe right before Halloween the week before or or in the middle let's see when Halloween is because like maybe so you're saying first responder September chil in October and then this is in November yeah because December is the holiday so once we and once we get in that it's it's kind of like a break cuz it's hard to get anyone all that's the only reason I was trying to space it a little bit you know so what did we say um that gives us one a month and that's perfect I mean the this is not us but it's still or we could push we could we could take the the fire thing we can push that into the early spring just so it spread out more oh like next a but it would be next march yeah okay that might be good because we'll have more funds and more time to work on that since that's new if we get a a spring like it was this year it would be nice yeah so okay I'm looking at the calendar and Halloween is on a 31st which is the Thursday the 26th is a Saturday maybe October 27th cuz there may be a lot of Halloween parties on the 26th pre but how about that 27th that might be a good chilly day Sunday sat yes Sunday on that day 26 27 okay okay Sunday October 27th something's on the 29th but I don't know what it is that's cook off we're we're leaning towards that date if Kyle has it available he's going to check Sunday October 27th yes sir yes are you here I've been here the whole time are you here October 27th second or S just AE 277 27 Sunday October 27th right CH cook off I'm going whip your butt again so is that like a noon to two or what I can't remember what we did I think we started earlier like 11: yeah you want to make do 4 hours like 11: to 2 people could leave when they want 11 to2 John what do you think good news is we have that weekend already cuz they had the peasant pal 11 three good so what do you think the time frame for the chili cook off I can't remember the other one yeah football game start at 1 um so you might you might want to start at 12 like get people kind of yeah let's do that so people can stay can the game can we have a game have like corn and things like that the I love that idea and then you can have it till about 334 I mean that's what G oh that would be great so 12 say 12 to 4 yeah um is there any way Kyle on the big screen that we could bring it down and have a game up just depends on um somebody's subscription that we use cuz Okay CU I'd have to put it through a computer feed so it be like the local obviously okay Florida Florida no it's going to be Sunday so it'll be oh which be nice because you know what the guys are always off doing their own things for football and this will include the women you know I'm just sign this take you a word for it so you know you're not like I'm not giving you no it's not no no no it's not a money I don't it's not a mortgage not a power of attorney I don't think the schedule came out yet came out today did it Tampa Bay yes cuz yesterday yesterday I said tomorrow oh wow that's funny you said that and then soon as I I remember looking yesterday at something I think I was watching the race maybe we can call it a football chili cookoff just to bring the guys and mine can be War Eagle chili yeah and people could come dressed in their favorite teams we don't scare anybody away why oh no I'm a GI we're saying we're saying the Sunday not the Saturday yeah I think well I think so Sunday yeah yeah this way it's a football day well Saturday is also football one's just college and one's well that would work for me Saturday would be nice this way people who go to church if we have the whole weekend Saturday's even better oh my word go to college the only problem is I am thinking but that's okay Saturday night you know people will be celebrating Halloween what time are the college games on though earlier they start a little earlier about 1230 so we would start at 11:30 then if we to me I'm if it's a sport we're watching it at my house so except I've given up on the NBA I don't like them the official schedule releas is tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. okay so so let's figure we could always change that but we could do 11:30 to 3:30 if we're doing the Saturday which would be the 26th and if we do the Sunday we'll do 12th to 4th there what's going to determine that you us well okay but when are we going to decide on that right now I don't know we need right today you said which which one is already on the calendar both days cuz we got the weekend reserved okay so it's whatever we want to do let's why don't we say do you have a preference uh I'm I'm just thinking Sunday you might have more conflicts if people are going to church church and if there's a yeah if there's potentially a say there's a bucks home game ah that I don't know what the buck schedule if it's what but here's the thing with college sir is like what's show me what's going to be thew what game oh I see what you're saying saying that's why I like the NFL because it's like if you know the buck games have won that's most people are gonna want to watch the buck game I mean the bucers they got SE season I sometimes you're not very I'm so excited about the mural I really am it's we're going to look so nice now between the flowers on the median and people are going to drive through b beach and be like wow this place Place really is Paradise yeah and they should have been saying that for the last 10 years or more whatever but oh that's you were saying it drops tomorrow the actual book schedule drops tomorrow yeah tonight or tomorrow night instead of 8 8:00 yeah oh why don't you just send us an email and we'll respond directly back to you yeah okay I'll tell you um yes I do think we should take Michael to consideration about Sunday having more church goers what you say comes out tomorrow night this but my head is very scrambled I knew I saw something that said tomorrow the bottom there than you he's college games well he's doing that I don't know if we need a motion or what maybe we just take a consensus but um I am definitely game for use I forgot your name that you called it but the fire firefighters thing First Responders First Responders meet Community First Responders early September now we change it to the spring yeah that's what oh the next spring 25 we're yes okay so meet hour that was Kyle's idea this way we'll have um a new budget and we're not going to jam it into a 6 week period because we do have the chili cook off and we have the veterans thing holiday social yeah so it's a lot yeah and if we're doing a cookout with or for the First Responders that would be you know you don't want to have it close to our like I'll help cook I don't care you know I would love to help oh and Patty I was supposed to ask you when we're when the belir beach is doing their landscape and planting would you like to help us oh jamm's already asked me she did well I had it in my notes that I was asking my two Patty friends oh well she yeah she asked me and I'm supposed to go to Home Depot with her sometime I think next week the 23rd is when she said yeah okay the the games that are being played are listed for college but it doesn't tell the times was are to to be determined but do tell the days but what would be like you guys all follow different colleges right 12:00 a lot of people are done with Ma so on the 26 serves I mean you got FSU versus Miami that's kind of a big game that would be a night game usually um Alabama I don't even know that is Missouri is that MH Miz M um Au playing e University of Kentucky Texas is playing vanderbelt I think oh cuz they're in the SEC now um and who is it I know right it's like 22 teams it's ridiculous my son's on his way to France a how nice where are you going if you don't mind it do you mind no um Berlin salsburg Munich France uh Paris and London but we're stopping in New York on the way there and we're going home for a B on the way home so my whole family will be there in June huh you be ready for that big wedding right my's there I better be ready for

Berlin salsburg Munich and then we'll be with Pete and his wife in Paris and London so yeah oh wow yeah my friend just went on Z and verman and so I want to do that one I also want do Ireland he going to Ireland I know so you don't have answers on football so we can just wait for your email yeah and I don't think unless the bugs are at home I don't think it's going to make a huge difference put it this way I don't think we have to just right this minute it's what hopefully it's 1:00 away bug G yeah and that would be and I don't think we need to decide this minute because you have both days reserved already and as soon as we do make a decision you can release one of the days to the public no no the whole weekend's going to be booked CU let's just decide when we know for sure yeah we'll be open is that okay I will share the information when it comes out okay that's perfect but John are you here that weekend hello John what's up are you here the October 26 27 weekend uh that's perfect

the side now I think is it okay well hello John yeah did you have something to say no I was uh the only way I can tell and I was supposed to talk as everybody shuts up there so I wonder if you wanted me to say something well you know that doesn't happen very often shut up no I'm sitting my kitchen table anyway anyway sorry go ahead no you go ahead what do you want me to no um uh where we just got done with the the chili cook off is the last thing I thought we uh decided on merchandise is there anything on merchandise I I I have something for other business no no updates on the merch no updates on it I mean the last thing we had I think I captured in a minutes that Rene was working on a new form name for that Renee no a new form for for the merchandise keeping up with was going to try to make me one that I could keep in there and also keep in here cool oh okay great so I didn't have to go every start over and every time they sell something they'll mark it off yeah then you have to count it like got a rolling rolling inventory there it is um the B Beach Community Foundation is going to be selling beautiful enormous beach towels with l CH it okay what color they they're like from the end of this table to here big what color wo oh beautiful Stripes that's like a I like the stripes yeah I have the old strip one and the white one the the know these are beach beach towels like you know like uh what do they call them like the big bath beach towels they're super big anyway they're super pretty and they have like red and green and teal and blue so they're all different color strip stripes and they're writing belir beach in blue like our blue so and and when and how much um that will be confirmed after this evening okay cool cuz some of the embroidery we I say do you know when they'll be ready they're going to sell before they even are available yeah they're going to sell them what but be have to get your name on the list cuz it'll probably out quick yeah I'll call you tomorrow or I'll text you tomorrow what the price and everything and we may be selling them on what the website so we see so I guess the next thing we have to do is come up for the next meeting um I do I do have another other business business um and at the uh Beach cleanup last couple weeks ago there was a suggestion that we uh do B Shore Park for a cleanup because the beach is you know it's in great it's in great mhm so um you know so I I said I would bring it forth I mean I you know I thought it sound said said there's more stuff over there more regularly because people are back there well and it brings it more in I right right from the water flow mhm so we could alternate or we could if we had enough people we could do two groups right on the website and sign so what you guys whenever you want to do that I like the idea yeah I mean we could start it this I'm on this month Oh I thought I was cuz I can't do July I mean I can't do yeah I can't do ju I thought we swap no no no I could swap on that one June and then Patty's July and August and I cannot do I won't be here I be in Alaska oo nice let me see a week in the Seattle area and all in Washington and then a week in the Alaska Cruise beautiful did that they loved it well that's why everybody keeps telling this but we have a trip to Seattle for some friends of Lloyd's from growing up nice and I said going that far for 3 days you better make it a vacation so and I'm Alaska Cru is on my bucket list so awesome a couple week M exactly two week Wednesday to a Wednesday very excited and that's what Aaron's supposed to give me a list of what to do in Washington state that whole area talked about it a long time all the great hiking Fe he told me he was going to give me a list to do that so maybe since that's the 4th of July weekend we don't do it that weekend I was wondering that you know because that's kind of tough we'll put a thing up that's my thing is I don't know exactly what I'm looking at the calendar it's Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday people are people going to split yeah I would think well that or they'll come here yeah but the thing is if if the fourth is on um a Thursday it's most likely people will be giving off on the Friday so you're looking at a 4day weekend y I really like the idea if you want my opinion to cancel for July have us switch to be the following month and then back and if we want I don't even know where Bay Park is right here in the back here oh just right around the little yeah so that's what I say we could have I mean we do do that on bridge cleanup you do yes you come down on the Bayside holy mackerel yeah sometimes we're 15 people down here we do it all Pat especially Patty po off and I we come all the way down right behind we go into the water we walk up by where the cops are you know where they Park we come all the way back in but that's only every quarter it is only every quarter but you walk through the water out there not into the water like you know okay okay got you cuz you better have on some I yeah like we're there's sand like over here it's all sand and we'll walk down and yeah get all the way up to the water yeah we I can't tell you how much we pick up from there when's the next Beach clean up yes when is I me not not the beach no that's June 1st when's the next Bridge clean up uh uh July 20th July July 2 good job is that right so what would it take what would it take if we made the June 1 there and then that's like 6 weeks because if we if we did if we canceled July ju and then we turn around the first Saturday a that's only two weeks coming through that if that's the route that you know that Deb does right then you're you're coming through there like two weeks ago and then it's going to be almost like the beach well it's kind of going to to you since you're doing J so I don't know what would so how how would that work how would it just be um it's it is July 20th okay would it just be you know just advertise that hey this month we're having a park clean up instead and then what I could do is I you could be here and I could be there okay all right and I can send people I can you can do this really okay why not or just greet them and say hey it's not here it's over there so what are you saying just for the first time or I'm saying like like in two weeks the we got to try it first so yeah for the first time oh so June 1st and then I mean it maybe so I don't I think I think for June 1st you should continue what you've always done because it's close yeah but he was saying if you do it in June July it's too close to your Bridge clean up for us to clean up back here yeah and then ju is a long way so I mean we like said we could just we could just try it right and and see you know if you're available and we're kind of doing a CO Event Y and then say Hey you can do this but we're we're trying something new and we're going over there we could advertise it I don't know if you want to co- advertise we could advertise it as the park and for those that are programmed just to come to 19th Street you tell them say hey we can you can do the beach or you can go join the rest of the group over at City Hall you know behind City Hall first of all I'm the one who post cooler oh okay yeah foral okay either with a shoulder strap or just a whole like 12 to 15 little bottles maybe 20 little bottles but we don't need that ginormous thing we just don't we don't have enough people mhm no we don't so maybe we can make maybe we could ask volunteers to like kind of take over this a little bit like maybe once a while like when John's here how I ask people what I always ask people they want to help us with it you know they can take out yeah they just like coming and the few that come we've got several regulars that come unless they're ill they come Frank and his wife almost always come and then there's other couple is a little bit older they're probably my age and they always come can never remember their names but they're super duper nice mhm benuto or who they have about Halloween don't they come to clean up on b or I think it's bomo or something it might be I don't think so really they do a registration at the Halloween they have she has really short hair yeah I'm terrible with names I when you teach school there's only so many names that will go in your head and at that point you won't remember anymore I believe that's a lot of Nam like 3500 names or something that and I talk middle school so I had six classes a day and they had anywhere from 20 to 37 in each class they called like the siblings cuz I was a younger sibling all the older siblings names y y yeah so do we want to do the if we can advertise it as the park sure and the beach CL and then and then we just kind of join mhm and then you can be in this parking lot and I can be in that one just in case somebody does somebody comes in 19th and they say hey this and I can have a couple of bags and gloves and you'll have the rest of it mhm okay okay all right so I think we need um uh a motion and I'll I'll do it if you want we need a motion for it's probably two motions she has to make the motion all right right or you no anyone can make all right so so I think the the first order of business we just kind of do them in order that I like to move that for the June 1st Beach cleanup that we do a joint location between 19th Street beach access and Bayside Park uh I will be here at the park Patty will be at 19th Street and we will and we'll advertise City Hall parking lot right yes M yeah okay thank you be access will be I second that motion all right so yes everybody approved yes yes I John did you hear that all right great good all right i' also uh like to make a motion that we um that we cancel the July 6 Beach cleanup uh in favor of the extended holiday weekend I'll second that motion okay all of hi hi hi okay thank you motion fast to get off in six minutes okay okay and then what Michael are we going to go back to then it will will start in August we will start all alternating with beach park or not I think let's see how it goes how it go okay yeah but but I would say that in in August we're we're back to the beach for sure yeah because we'll just have the bridge clean up on 20th right that's what they said yeah and then so the next Bridge clean up wouldn't be until October so maybe if we're going to alternate September back at the park May that's perfect may work but the thing is that you're they're going to converge because you're doing it every other month with every third month so at one point they're going to be you know kind of a game time decision I'll say it that way yeah well we could always adjust accordingly I don't actually think this would take as long as the beach does an hour no not with concentrated people but if you're doing this if you want my opinion you need to go up where the cops hide if we're walking and walk back this way when you walk back this way it's quite a long walk the Rocks I I can't tell you how much trash how many um what are those like little edible meals I must have picked yes 30 of those over there wow
