    "transcript": "meeting order planning and zoning board first order of business maybe an approval agenda that we have pursued second move to second it approval of the january 13 meeting notes any questions additions or subtractions get to the discussion discussion on the assigned city code sections uh before we get started going around the room i know that i spent quite a bit of time this past few days reading this code and of course i don't think any of us are attorneys although i talked business law at one time i am not used to a lot of these legalese and i know they were prepared by attorneys reviewed by city council and then laid upon this group here to look at approve or disapprove or make questions about the same i don't know if this is going to take a long time or a short time but it seems like one heck of a lot of work and i know that uh there should be some specific questions asked by council i believe as to what section or we'd like some input from them as to where what they're questioning now is this just a matter of procedure as indicated it's a matter of law well and i would i would ask anybody that speaks to just take your mass down because we're not going to infect anybody at this distance and you can't understand half the stuff you battle through a cloth not [Music] okay and available we gave them to the city attorney and he adjusted those recommendations after the report was given to the city council if they want to adopt them and this is kind of the same process and i got to give wanda credit because she did this and that's what they did two years ago they went through made a little spreadsheet kind of went through the sections and just asked everybody okay do we need to you know like i'll just use the first couple things uh proof of proof of delivery adding a photo that's probably a good idea because sometimes those enforcement things come back to us they're certified letters and we get them back so what we do we post it so and we do take a picture but it doesn't say that here so maybe we need to add that word then what we'll do is go through this later on but i was just making a comment as chairman we're in a situation to pursue this and i think we're putting a lot of a lot of time on things that we and some of it you don't even have to change anything really well that's what i'm looking at i'm seeing things that are put out and approved and written by an attorney approved by council passed on and serveability and everything else and then we're looking at it and if we see something i'll give you for instance i went through this marine thing for bellar beach i see absolutely nothing wrong with it absolutely nothing it says report something when you see it's wrong that seems very reasonable yeah the only thing in that area that i i will tell you and i told you last time i think we need to have a little more teeth in it as opposed to you see things well you know if a sea wall is pushing in or something we need to be able to tell that property owner you need to get an engineer to look at your seatbelt that's really what we need to do because there's no one in the city that can i don't know what you mean by teeth i really don't well i'm going to ask marvin to walk around and check every dot in the city he'll do it i know he would no what i'm saying is just something in the cove and that's why i gave you i gave you madeira beach i gave you that little pamphlet just to look at and that's something we'll discuss further all i'm suggesting is that we have a way if if we get a complaint or we see something in our travels that looks potentially dangerous that we we have something in the code that says you know resident please or however [Applause] and that's that's what i'm saying i didn't understand the thing you said i said it's removing anything that's vague there's a lot of vague in here that needs to be i think the any code you read is vague that's why we hire an attorney to interpret it for us it's it's all over the place right so so that's you know when we get to that portion we'll we'll get some more details i i think the first sections that we're talking about most of that is just housekeeping like we need to get we're rid of a police department okay code enforcement go to enforcement okay and what london did we'll get to that we'll get to that i don't want to jump into that right i want to keep some kind of order right i'm going to go out right now and ask marvin what do you eat all right what i have written for lynn there was a couple of instances close to the neighborhood the neighbor next to me the sea wall went down i understand that he explained that the last meeting side of the bridge i put together a basic list of things that a code enforcement officer could look at that would put a warning out there one is a cracked cap two is no weak holes in the sea wall relieve the hydraulic pressure behind it the next is horizontal cracks in the slabs okay these are the old ones next is at low tide when we do the inspection if toward the water line at low tide you see a space between those slabs it's all in here that's in that form that 11th century but we have nothing in our codes to indicate how a code enforcement officer should go and look at that wall to indicate that these are the items that weren't an engineer to look at the wall and determine whether it needs repair or replacement it's all listed in this did you read this it's all listed in there about the weep holes and the hydro sensitivity and that is something that i picked up in the french right but we have nothing in the coach to indicate what a list of items are that have officer could look at to say okay we need an engineer to come out and inspect these seawalls and what would that cost that would say okay then once they inspect it after they find a cracked cap or horizontal crack does it need replacement there is another step but an engineer would have to look at it at that time to make sure like at the end of all our fingers or an area where there's a lot of wave action as the sea bed moved away from the bottom of the slab which would then cause you to get with a lot of hydraulic pressure okay but we can't do that type of inspection that's just one part of it that's in that manual that lynn put together we'll pay across that bridge when we get to it then next is the unfinished business and we can go into the email that was sent out in effect by rudy and i that we just changed the order which we were going to procedurally conduct these code reviews now we can go around the table and start with uh i think we ought to start with wanda because she's prepared a dossier that's very nice would you proceed in your observations please yes okay i did this last time i figured the best way to do a discussion is as i'm going through make a note of the section that i had a point on what question i had about if i had any suggestion for solving that question a lot of these questions are going to be discussions once we get here and um last time i had asked the committee members to do something similar it doesn't have to be this format and send them all to patty beforehand so she can distribute so we can review them before the meeting because something i have a question on you might have an answer for and that might trigger something it might trigger something else so and then the very the very first one there was on the enforcement procedure i first think i was reading that i was thinking why don't they just take a photo because fedex comes by they deliver me a package they take a photo of that package on my porch and i know process servers take a photo of you when they hand you that subpoena so that's that seems like something that would be a good idea and i just put it on there as a question as to whether that's something that would be possible yeah and realistically we do that when we post it just to have another document because you'll have people that i'm going to give you one that's coming up friday the individual has mailing address is the house that he rents here he doesn't live there you know somewhere else well all his his mailing address is that street so we mailed it there and it was returned to us but we posted the property also would you please lower your masks awesome we posted the property also and we took a picture of it so we've done more than we needed to do by the code so that's already done but but we need to add it to the to say that and there's also the section that says it can be hand delivered to anybody who is a resident of the property and who's over you know right a minor age but you really need to get a picture of handing that that to the person if you're not posting it because i i know they bring subpoenas to the va and as a receptionist they could hand it to me right and they would get a picture of me accepting a subpoena no when i see them coming i turn around and run away yeah what would you put there i think we just adding a photo in that section is probably a smart idea even though we already do it for when we post it you know your comment about publishing the newspaper it's in the code that way but we've never done that that you know they've always mailed them and delivered them i mean actually yeah okay then you're saying that this can be taken care of all right all right item d then item well that that's part of the state statute isn't it yeah so does that still have to stay in the code or is it it's just something you it's like the checklist and you never get down that part of the chat right right so that's basically it right okay no point and then on the foreclosure section so the city can authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lead have we ever done that no not to my knowledge i think we've had i guess we've never had a house with the lean that high i think the highest lead we ever had was that house over there on when it didn't get up to like 40 rupee i can't remember across from right yeah yeah yeah but that's a good thing and we settled with them at that time they got the house done just the threat that they can do it i think it's good to have it in there yeah no it's that's a good thing schedule of civil yeah the schedule civil penalties the penalties there's the list and it says it relates to specific chapters seems like anything in the code would be subject to civil penalties or is there something i'm missing there well i think what it's listing is the sections of the code that there is a penalty allowed not you know that every section has a penalty and it's it's just giving you that information so you know i don't think that's a big issue okay next okay the next one was the duty to provide written notice of the foreclosure the properties vacant the owner registrar must designate and return a local individual a local property management company responsible for security and maintenance of the property has this been an issue in the past or do we have clients for the most part no we we have you know ever once in a while um let's see this is null was a problem right okay so but that was a long time ago we've got one right now that's under property management we've had to run them down a few times because these when they go into foreclosure or the bank takes them it's like they go in a black hole somewhere you gotta research and find out who's got it and our code does require them to register that foreclosure with us it's in the code it's in the code okay and if anything and if they don't comply they're subject to penalty we can take them to code enforcement if the registration is not must be received within 14 days of the first citation for improper maintenance is 14 days uh i think 14 is reasonable is it yeah it's a couple weeks depending on what it is they've got to do like as an example i'll use one that we have on belt boulevard they had to do a fence repair and put a new fence up so you're not going to get a fence guy tomorrow to do it it takes some time and the registration fee [Music] was this fixed at 100 [Music] does that cover the cost of administering the process i i think i think the things like that should the answers yes yeah because we're not really doing anything they're sending it to us you know they're there and we're collecting it putting it in the file make sure we're aware of it on the next section is where i saw something it says they must inspect and maintain the property on a regular basis i think regular probably needs a little more definition to it and what would what would be a reasonable amount of saying we need to inspect and maintain the property should that be monthly bi-monthly at least once a quarter weekly would be too much have you run into trouble with this situation no yeah so if we did it you know set a time frame like you're saying i think that's a better situation as opposed to just say regular what is regular i think we're better off saying specific so that's a yes okay then we get to section b there are maintenance requirements are the funds for failure was that covered in 234 234 i think it was uh yeah the the magistrate is the one that she can find up to 250 a day and for things that are so this is covered yeah the the magistrate when they come to complete their case she she has that authority she can hire fine up to 250 a day for the first violation and up to 500 a day for retreat violation and then for the uh irreparable which would be a good example would be a short-term rental uh we don't have as much of that as we used to we we had a rash of people just saying i'll pay the thousand dollars well the console which isn't in your computes in the front raised it to 5 000 for multiple occurrences which uh hopefully if we get another one of that sounds right two or three two or three times of that you know they're gonna have a lead on the house of fifteen or twenty thousand dollars that'll feature that should work yeah i mean we've got one right now with the lean and twelve thousand dollars because of multiple thousand dollar fines good luck with that well they sell the house you do what you can i understand not a homesteaded house so so you can okay on 233 the sheriff's office will have the authority to inspect properties are are they doing that is there going to be is there there are problems that i also question the wording that says this shall be at their discretion as to what is adequate and i kind of have a problem leaving it up because we had the rv in the in the driveway and the sheriff's pump came and i said oh you have a permit further yeah i saw that he was going to walk away run said we have no rent nothing no problem okay well are they really doing a good job i i have not been pleased with the sheriff's requirements of course well i will tell you my opinion is they haven't been doing a very good job and i think we're paying an enormous amount of money per hour for what we get out of it it's 48 bucks an hour this is a legitimate question but it's not our pervy yeah and realistically part of the problem is when you have the sheriff do it that's a deputy okay he's he's a sheriff he's not a co-enforcement has no background in law enforcement the only background he has is you know if you read something in the book that that's my been my concern and uh which is where leaving something thing like this at their discretion doesn't get the job done right right so maybe there's something that you want to think about um before you get out of this thing uh patty did you email those sections to them the ones that were missed no they handed them out okay okay there's a section that you didn't get sent to you or didn't get put in the book originally and it's uh section 2-350 which is our purchasing policy yes and there's only one paragraph basically and it's two 350 that i i kind of feel like you know i want some feedback that this this purchasing policy was written her code was written many many 20-plus years ago and what you could buy for three thousand dollars 20 years ago is a lot different than what you can buy today and you know i want to make a suggestion what suggest what where are we at on here uh on two section 350 250 three three here okay i'd like to recommend that that goes to five thousand dollars okay and then in b uh the three will change to five to ten that'll still stay the same but with the other caveat that the city council may authorize an expenditure between 10 and 25 000 upon receipt of at least three written bids quotes or proposals because doing a bid for something that's twenty thousand dollars it's very time consuming and you can go to three vendors and get a price for it good example we've got a bid out right now for to put i think it's six video cameras around the building well that that process is very cumbersome very long and really all you're doing is buying video cameras and you know it would seem to me that it would be much more efficient if you could just go get three quotes instead of doing the advertisement in the newspaper the documents you have to do to you know big big document so those are a couple of things i'd like to see change the console's still got to approve them but it eliminates it and we've done this we've suspended bid requirements for something like what did we do recently uh oh a repair on donato street was like 17 000 well by our document we had we would have had to bid that we went out and got three quotes and then i submitted to city council and asked them to suspend the bid requirements well you know i'm taking that step out of there it's what i'm asking to to you know so you want me to go 10 to 25 instead of right there there's an extra sentence that'll be in there and i'll get you something right and clarify you you prepare that will you prepare that yeah i'll send you something okay yes yeah but the rest of the purchasing code is fine it's just those initial sections and from an efficiency standpoint it's much easier we're still taking it to the city concert would there be any advantage linda putting some wording in there saying that these thresholds can be modified by council by resolution high resolution i will probably that will give you more more ability to go to council and bypass this kind of a process right would you bring that back to us that would be fine okay that that's the only thing really in there sure we've completed it i was just waiting for it now we'll go around from right to left with the board rudy comments yeah first one of the things i kind of thought why do we do this and section two is primarily code enforcement and special master yet neither one of them was invited to this meeting and i think their input would be critical what have they encountered so far in enforcing these codes where do they think their shortcomings and what are their recommendations they're the people that do this every day and face the public and know the shortfalls so i would recommend that somewhere in this process that susan moore who's the special master and i talked to her today she wasn't available today for some short notice i left a message for dane daughtery for dorothy code enforcement officer for them to come in but at some point i think the committee should request they come in and comment maybe we want to do it at the end of what we're suggesting and have them review that and give us their thoughts plus add anything to it but i just think those people need to be part of this process um and just so you know laura is the code administrator so she she does all these this is the question is it in this committee or is it sitting in my at my left she's she's the administrator for code enforcement uh she takes care of all the many administrators yes she you want to ask her and she was she was the code enforcement officer until we did the sheriff martial certainly by the end of this meeting i think bars had the opportunity to yeah give us some input yeah where she feels we need some upgrading a lot of what i also see are too many um maze and not enough shelves first one i came to was when we talked about rental managers in section 2 245 b it says tenant can be identified may be cited for the violation in addition for rental properties rental managers may be providing a courtesy it should be shall be provided a copy and you said something about rental managers have to provide you with copies of foreclosures should we not have them if they're renting property in this city shouldn't they be registered for every property that they rent they need to register to know the agent for that so that we know who to go to because they have to know the people that own the property or are legally responsible for the property so they need to be more accountable to the properties they rent they just can't come in pick up the fees and go home then you'd be accountable for some of us we asked them to do that but it's very hard to monitor which properties are being foreclosed unless we're notified and the properties that notify us they do register currently we don't have that many they're in foreclosure but then they renew their foreclosure and they send us the documentation and a lot of the wording in section two is taken deliberately out of the state statute so where it says shell in may that's from the state statute because it may can be this way shell means you will do it right and that's why they specifically worded that way and consequently they do word it very vaguely and that's how the state statute was also hurting yeah but it's my understanding that we can written here somewhere that we can go over and above what the state requests i'm not sure that well i'm not sure of that either i'm just i just know that we're changing the law no for instance they say applying to such and such in their case we can say it may be more than that can we you can you can yeah the fines there's a like is an example i'll use the short-term rental line the maxima city our size can go is five thousand dollars that's the max if you're a city larger i think it can go to 25 000. like i think miami charge is 20 000. every every time they catch somebody twenty thousand dollars so uh and those those fines and things are part of them are set by the state because their level finds like i think it's called uh where we talked about the uh the chat are we getting into an area of interpreting the law and i i think we've overstepped what we're talking about well if it's in the law it's in the law we're getting away from what i'm actually asking actually rental properties are far and above more problematic in the city than resident owned and lived in product right so one of the key elements are rental managers a lot of these properties are owned by people who don't live in them or live here right so they're turned over to rental management relations my thought is we need to make those people more accountable to us more visible to us if you're renting a property if you're a room manager of a property of lrp you have to tell the city that you're the manager if you're the manager of that property gives all my contact information and this is these are the tenants and this is the you know the particulars of the rebel agreement or at least you have to tell us it's not you know may or shall it did shout yeah tell the city laura has this been a large problem are we talking about foreclosed properties local rental properties just communicating with rental managers of rental properties we get very little communication with rental property excuse me you should have more you need more you feel it's shorter it would be very hard to monitor it would take an extraordinary amount of our time to make them accountable um excuse me maybe then it needs a penalty if you don't register a property as the rental manager your property can be fined x number of dollars and maybe then well they they can be and i'll give you an example that's happening in a code hearing this friday they didn't pay their rental registration fee he sent them two notices they still didn't pay it so now we're going to take them to code enforcement so now what will happen the base administrative fee for code enforcement hearing is 500 so it's going to cost them 500 there depending on what the magistrate does she's gonna assess the registration fee and the hundred dollar late penalty to him probably so in essence it's costing them 900 that they could have got done for 300. so and she could charge him an additional fine if she wanted to for not complying so there is a penalty for it for not registering their property but there's nothing that says a rental manager has to come to the city and say i'm renting property in this city i'm responsible for this property just seems common that we should have that coming from them i think you'd find that more in the condos than you would in these single homes because a good majority of these are just rented by you know the whole one again is it is it a big problem laura it's hard to say it's hard to say when we give them when we provide them their rental registration form there's an area on there that we ask them to identify if they have a property manager have you had problems with it i would say 95 of them come back with no property manager indicated so we have no way of knowing whether they just failed to provide that information or they really are managing it themselves and if you happen to stumble across it you go the route that lynn was talking about usually when we find out if there's a rental property manager involved is when we're having code violations at that property through doing investigation then we will identify that there actually is a property manager involved but 95 of the property owners who fill out that rental registration report do not put that information on there because it also changes a lot of the rental properties only have a management company one year and then the next year they change it so they never update that information with us even though they pay the fee every year they'll still pay their fee but they're not telling us if there's a rental company either they don't have one or they're just admitting the information and it would take a considerable amount of time to do all investigations for all those properties i i agree that there needs to be some some teeth there saying if if you indicate no property manager and we find out later that there is that's a problem would this help you laura lynn because if you do for one you can't not do for all of them so i would have to go through every form and then investigate each and every one it would take an extraordinary amount of time to do it i guess my point was if you find out through code violations later that they've added a property manager or chain property manager and didn't and you weren't notified that there should be not nothing to go investigated but you find out through other processes they answered that they said they'd turn it over to the code enforcement well we're we're asking the homeowner the property owner to provide that information are you finding the rental management company well you're you're technically you can only find the property you can't find them you know the management company there's really nothing you could do to them because the code is for shooting just for lots of property so if you're by if your property is violating the code we don't go after the guy that's written in the house even though we could because the code does give us that allowance if we want to go after both we could but we don't we traditionally go after whoever the property owner is okay are you satisfied randy well if you read 2 245 all the way down from k it says managers of rental properties by the total enforcement manager i think it should be shallow i'll leave it at that okay the group wants to go with it the only other thing i found prior to that backing up to eight notice that failure of the violator to attend the hearing may result in a fine being assessed against him should be him or her just and that is in uh 245 e 8 now as well yeah we want that one the shower [Music] manager a list of properties they manage just have it in there why not and then your next edit was 240 245 e eight at the end of it she says against him it should be him [Music] [Music] are they having actual hearings or are they all done can hear you angela no we're having we haven't had any for a while we're having one this friday actually three of them two for rental and one because a house isn't completed within the time frame of the code and he was given an extension and it's not moving and i'm sure you know where that house is on the 25th my business that big block or concrete monster so he's left he's over his two-year window so do they do that here yes okay because i know we got summoned to court during duty and they said forget it everything's virtual you know so i just was curious about yeah we're doing it here i mean the magistrate comes from all distance and you're satisfied yeah fine anything else ready now the 246 80. and the special master shall have the power to subpoena me violators witnesses from the hearings subpoenas may be served by the city police department should be deleted yeah the police department will ever have another one then ellis county sheriff or other operating processors it's official i think just house vpn that's going to happen will you note that i haven't found it yet he's keeping it a secret was that him 247 247 got it i don't see anything about police yeah i see that city police department yeah okay anything else ready thank you fine job you and one of both angela so i just had a question i can't hear you i'm sorry [Music] i'm glad you did that i don't blame you um in section two um on v say it again 2 48. okay b um the fine of 500 being opposed imposed on each case is that still yeah applicable the 500 yeah usually it costs us about 300 from the magistrate so i was wondering if the costs were true that's 40 percent profit that didn't mean well it's not profit because you're mailing i'm just trying to speed things up a little man and that was just recently adjusted okay and so the other fine amounts in here have been adjusted as well like the 250 dollars per day right the the only thing that's been adjusted recently is the very last line where it says a thousand that's been raised reduce that no no increase it we increased it to the maximum we could for the size of our city you've already done that we've already done that it's just not the okay angela i just had a question on 261. um um a city council may designate certain employees or agents as code enforcement officers is it that like on a case by case basis depending on what type of problem it is like they mentioned a fire animal control officer i mean do you specify if it's an animal issue they're not using now that's that's just a kind of catch-all phrase you know laura does some code enforcement i do some you know things happen on the weekend but then they have our deputies so nothing exists okay it's not that's not an issue thank you and then on section 311 e i just i had a question because it seems like this is being filed like paper files do we have backup computer files yeah the ordinances are actually online okay yeah the city clerk has to maintain the originals for all ordinances and resolutions it talks about binders and i just had this vision of these massive violent encounters well but that's part of records management there's certain things you got to keep forever we have minutes back to 1950 right so well if we were updating this and you weren't doing that anymore i would just say you know maybe we want to well every council member gets a heart gets a binder of ordinances and you bring them by every couple of months to get them updated and we have a final one here it's not as much as it used to be so that's handled yeah all right thank you brenda no changes no comments i have nothing further except to say fine job to those who contributed to this situation including the city personnel now we'll proceed to number 10 54. i didn't cross 10 off smack and again i'll start with life my first point here was on the this businesses enterprise they've restricted have we had more businesses pop up since the pandemics and more people are working from home has that been um not that we've noticed the technicality of is there a business in your home is are you paying employees there so that's very hard to say that someone's doing business in their home they may be operating a private business you know but they don't have employees there and they aren't coming there every day so we have thank you okay so in the occupational taxes or imposed on any home-based businesses that are identified right and then we got down to the fees these these all go into the general fund i'm sorry you said yes right so even if they don't have employees the we don't have any businesses in the city of bellar beach that's what i thought right except the hotel right well that's debatable and we're trying to get that rectified when we do our next comp plan let's not go there we're going to try to resolve that issue okay but at this point in time we don't have any businesses which is primarily defined by definition of business partner and is primarily defined by definition of business you can have a home office right and you can have a home computer doing your number right but if you're the things like having clients come to your house or things like that that's a different situation no employees coming in now customers coming in now no people coming in now coming in and out right yeah okay we had those for a while we've had a couple of those for a while especially that big one but he has since moved his operations please continue monday on the on the fees have there been any any problems with collecting these fees any complaints or issues no this is one that i think when they adjusted the rental registration this was missed and just my personal opinion i guess to some degree is the base for rental registration is 300 well that first one i think should be 300 and then the 10 should probably go to something like 20 and 10. because again these fees have not changed and let's see i'll tell you what probably 20 years so you have no problem with this situation no i i think they need to be adjusted okay have we done any investigation of other communities and what's usually normal no we haven't but we we can do that and i can get you some information on that the problem is and we only really we have three right four the timeshare that falls under this the motel nautical watch the motel falls up in this and the other resort a portion of it has fell under this because the guy claims he's a timeshare but that's another thing we're going to do a little more investigation into it's beyond our pay scale right yes he's he's got he owns 21 of the 42 units there and the other 21 people have to pay the 300 registration fee but you know he he claims he falls under this thing because it's a time share well we found out that he's not really a timeshare so you know it's it's a skirting issue and i don't think we need to go there i don't i don't think that if if he classified himself properly he would be subject to this right so we're basically looking at these numbers and pretend up to 10 rooms is 300 11 to 20 make it 20 run over 20 10 for additional okay thanks for waiting okay i'm sorry and 54.62 did you say that that um registration is now 300 yes okay so it just hasn't been updated here right it's now 300 and 100 light feet is still there okay now my concern on on this next one on part b with the council of my future members daniel winter registration fee by resolution this doesn't and is not impacted by the state restriction on short-term rental stuff right okay because i talked to leslie and she thought that was why we hadn't changed it before because we had gone up to 300 and come back down to 100. yeah that hasn't the short-term rental section i've told the council probably i think we were concerned i think the concern here was that this would cross that line and get us in trouble with the legislature that's probably why we backed it off right one one thing that we that i know wars talk to me about and i don't really care either way is making it a calendar year b is close to fiscal year because i think as laura said it confuses people she's the one that deals with it the most so i don't know what your thoughts are on that calendar is a lot easier to think about yeah because because what people tell her is we send out the rental registrations and send them out in september and they are due by october 1st it becomes late it's october 31st people are very confused because some of them will pay and they say oh i paid for that year well it's because we're on the fiscal year and their mindset is the calendar year so it does present a little bit of confusion for the people who are trying to apply and register and pay because in their minds i paid during that year i've already paid here but october 1st begins 2021. so you're handling a situation on a case-by-case basis no they have to pay back no i mean it's you you're taken care of i just when the inquiry comes in easier for the registrants if it was on a calendar basis like our beach passes are on a calendar year basis when you get a beach pass it's good until for the calendar year is that your recommendation to this committee i think the rental registration would be easier for people to comply with if it was on a calendar year basis rather than a fiscal year it's input from your committee you probably did it on a particular basis because of the budget i'd like to ask for a motion from the zoning department did it go to a calendar year second is that in the code here anyway yeah it is it's in 5462 a so what do you want that october 31st date to actually read january to december it would be uh let's see january 1st and january 31st right yeah yeah yeah say it again without your oh january 1st and january 31st but it wouldn't take effect until next year right right would you do so note that on the please thank you with recommendation from the zone we on the last one 153 we have 54 133 all the homestead executives i was just wondering if any notes needs to make here be made here for the um additional homestead exemptions that were approved in the november election i didn't study how the wording would change due to that but this seemed to have gone into a little bit of the detail about the exemptions i was just wondering if that needs to be updated i couldn't remember exactly what the new exemptions were i think widows of the disabled veterans would inherit their additional exemption and there was one other that i don't remember well that was one of my questions also and i copied i mean i made a copy of the application so there were several and i didn't know why fellaini's just had one of those why we only had one listed you know the income yeah the income may need to that could be different now yeah let's see that's 15 years ago you'll have to look at that do you probably just want to have a fred take a look at this and update it according to the new exemptions okay that's stylus thank you comments from rudy nothing angela i just have the homestead which i okay brenda all right lynn do you want to say something about the homestead exemption no we'll get those okay i think this group has done a hell of a job i can't say that out loud on the camera it's done a great job in the attempt to look at the code at least the first two sections that we have now the next one is scheduled for number 10 which will be it by itself for the next meeting yeah right 27th at 1. now is there any unfinished business to come before the group does the group want to hear from the special master and the current co-enforcement officer in the city i think it's pretty well covered with laura sitting there for why don't you just assign me to discuss that with them the special master and the code enforcement to ask them if they have any and then i'll report that that's an excellent idea seeing you initiated the contact price yes he paid the price i volunteered right yes any other unfinished business with the group i would just ask one of you share this with us your template it's just a word document three a table three columns okay so this didn't come from this thing you just did this okay good job donna you said it one are you still spearheaded this was excellent thank you very much and i think section 10 will probably generate a lot more so i'm going to go through it first and send it to patty she will distribute just what if you have comments ahead of time then we need to get that send them to patty and we'll get them out to everybody so you've got them before you can come are we going to be missing any pages on chapter 10 no no chapter 10 and the others are i think 10 and 94 and a lot of that we've already updated so it's just kind of going through and you know there's things that maybe we missed i do have a section for citizens comments and i see one citizen here jc the only thing that has come up is security systems okay a lot of people are putting cameras around their homes you know outside surveillance cameras oh yes around their homes so how do you keep that camera of looking in the neighbor's windows well you put a counter camera on the other side and look at his window right should there be anything is that an issue could it be an issue privacy that is called the epitome of pandora's box [Music] it brings the word to me enforceability it can't enforce it but does it pay to mention that campers if the camera's installed and they have that outside security type system that it must not go beyond i don't think this committee is in that situation i don't know what the laws are well i i know that when we were looking at these before we were looked at looking at lining we're talking about light pollution isn't supposed to go over the property line if you have outside lights they're supposed to be shielded in such way that it doesn't so we can i could see where something like that could be applied to uh security cameras as well right like pollution there's a lot of that going on in the city but i'm just saying that because we have an ordinance that deals with light pollution i think that could be that could translate to requiring something to say you know security home security cameras should be limited to the scope of your property did you mention this at council councilman did you bring this up at council no it's something new that has come to my attention so i'm here you know you're the committee that's going over the codes i thought i would bring it up and when you get to that area discussion it is it is our position as a committee to review the code not invent the code so i refer it to you as city council on behest of this committee to pursue your situation thank you any comments from the city representatives and i have to compliment these two people that put up with a lot of grief etc including the lady behind me patty who keeps us fully informed at this time i'd like to call for an adjournment second second all those in favor so order"
