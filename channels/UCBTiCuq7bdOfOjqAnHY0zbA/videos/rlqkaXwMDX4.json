in Virginia a retired lieutenant for Air Force served for US Army and Air Force in Italy Greece and Albania my husband is an active member I have two girls we move from from Virginia last year because this house used to be our vacation house and we since we both I'm I'm a businesswoman as well an entrepreneur in a real estate so I have a lot of real estate properties and business in Largo so I employee more than 10 employees every month I do pay them which is good for the city to grow the revenue and it's better for the town so we decided with my husband is still commuting I'm going to be moving here worked for pinelas County public school last year as a language arts teacher in all way down in Palm Harbor and I have two teenagers a 17 and 15 and Marcy which is my youngest one uh all a students a freshman in medical team at bhu she's going to have her right if you don't mind after I finish as well so why I'm here today first of all I know it's only 3 minutes I'm going to I hope I'm going get everything together but um it's um there is a situation my property my property is the only property got flooded in August last year and I reported that but I got punished for that because I reported to Mr Colin's attorney the real numbers and I got punished for them because I I overhead it 50 50% of the FEMA regulation and it's only $144,000 difference not only that the story starts here since December I don't have a house I got a denied letter telling me I need to demo everything that I've done and raise the property up so my question to the city manager and his attorney I understand they're referring to FEMA regulations but the FEMA regulation has unit a substantial Improvement and substantial damage they are exceptional because my daughter over there is suffering from mold is suffering from the illnesses and this city manager over there never to come and the I'm going to have to interrupt you uh you are not allowed to point that's fine because you made me last month to not speak about that and I don't have a house you sir have a house correct you have your kids under the roof I don't have a house right now so I need you to understand because we start this meeting with a pray to God but I don't think so we're talking about God here we are not caring about our citizen I pay taxes on time I an entrepreneur I have opened several business from Virginia over here so why I have to be treated differently did the city manager came to see the condition of the houses never never I just got to deny a letter so now what I'm doing is of course I'm going to apply with the compliance get the drawings and I want hopefully this city manager to approve my the new house when I'm going to get there I don't know there are a lot to tell the governor is involved the the house representative is involved I'm here today because Mr Lala told me to come and complain which Mr nval is the commissioner of pinelis County and their last resource will be the social media thank you I know I pass my time I apologize but I'm a mom I'm very irritated and I just it's just in my opinion is completely unethical it's not a human being to to to to to let the family without the house in the street it's just unbelievable thank you thank you any other citizen like to comment here at this time yes sir you said there's 3 minutes there's be 12 minutes I've got three people who are going to give me three minutes each raise your hands please Rick sh Jolie rero Bob Angela 12 minutes M please I can only thank you okay I've got it you want me to turn it okay I'm start good evening everyone it's been a while since I've been here excuse me can you give us your name Joseph Manzo Beller Beach 7 Street for may you all know me so it's been a while since I've been here August of 2022 some of you have heard that I had some medical issues glad I'm standing in front of you I'm healthy and I feel good and I thank some of you for the prayers you offered really appreciate that so why am I here I'm here cuz I was at B Shore a little while ago this letter addressed to Randall Mora dated March 21st 2024 how many of you have it oh you don't show me your hands I'll bet none of you have it why don't you have it I want to know I sat at their meeting and they said that they held this letter and Mr MOA knew about it until after our election because they didn't want that to interfere with the results of the election let's unpack that for a second Bel aore told our City attorney about a letter and it was Kept Secret from the citizens from the voters from potential people who might want to run for office were you afraid I was going to come back I'm not coming back because there's many many ways I can deal with stuff like this what's in that letter well the first thing that's in that letter and I'm going to go in backward order here they take issue with our city manager because accidentally he issued a pass a parking pass to one of the parking lots to someone who is not a b beach resident can't do that his predecessor did a lot I got him but worse than that you talk about the pot calling the kettle black these are the same people who right now fill up six Street lot with construction workers who filled up lot after lot with personal business parties open houses auctions one of my favorites they decided that NFL films could use two of our parking lots and what did this city do not a damn thing we did nothing they have no right to use those Lots at all it's in their ordinances and Fred Riley when I was mayor wrote a letter to them explaining that and they deem that letter not worthy of a response and they have the nerve to jump on Kyle here because he issu one parking pass please don't do it again but when they can park 60 ton construction cranes in a handicapped spot for 2 or 3 days and don't give a damn about the people with disabilities I find it hard to get behind this letter but it's even worse what they seek in this letter and I think why they kept this a big secret they want $23,750 for legal fees for Regina Kardash that's their City attorney for the work she did on my law suit against them and on top of that they got a $40,000 increase in their property insurance or their liability insurance well boohoo they had the opportunity on July 21st 2020 when I walked across the street actually it was virtual we had Co at the time and I gave them the opportunity give us back the umbrellas no lawsuit they said no then they got sued and despite the lies that were told my people in this city there was no deal in the a thing that was complete nonsense and some of you perpetrated that lie no there was no deal and I've got Robert Schmid their former mayor and Steve Bloom their former vice mayor who's now their mayor under oath on deposition saying there was no deal you lie to the citizens congratulations may it helped you get elected but it didn't help support our cause and I warned you that if you didn't support these Beach rights they were going to come and take more of them now let's talk about these requests for money Regina Kardash is Bill Regina Kardash did not put an appearance in that case so don't spin it and don't get me any garbage cuz I was there it was my case Regina Kardash never put in an appearance she came to a deposition she opened her mouth and I jumped down it because she had no right to speak they had not one but two very competent attorneys Tom Scar and Martin Champagne they were paid for by the Florida Le cities they didn't need Regina Kardash and if they chose to have her you shouldn't be paying for it the only other thing Regina did was prosecute a action against Peter rero and Bob Angelo who's in attendance tonight are having an umbrella on the beach the first people in the country to get a summons for that well I defended him that both of them and both of those cases were dismissed and you don't pay for them to go and prosecute cases that takes care of Regina now let's talk about insurance their insurance went up well when Frank bangard asked the city manager here about our insurance going up he was told that prices went up this year hey welcome to bonics prices are up on everything Insurance included but undoubtedly some of it is due to this lawsuit but understand the lawsuit for any of you who didn't bother to read it it's not just about the beach rights because of the umbrella it dealt with their mismanagement of the lot as trusty it dealt with a public trust Doctrine which is the wet sand that everyone in Florida is entitled to dealt with a lot of things and if they are paying extra insurance because of what I will say is their reluctance to do the right thing that's too bad you don't pay for it they're holding up the interlocal agreement what I said as a mayor was one of the worst agreements I had ever seen signed by Mike Kelly negotiated by that group back then and it's a terrible agreement and it's V as to whether we owe them or not owe them but I seem to think that our city didn't agree to pay for people to violate constitutional rights and put babies out in the sun so they can get skin cancer and for those of you who think skin cancer is a game come to MAF with me one Thursday we'll talk to some of the patients we'll see what a game it is this city didn't support me at all Dave gtis went and made a motion a resolution that the city wasn't involved that's the support we' got and I warned you they weren't going to stop so now I'll tell you what's not in your letter Kardash said basically we'll opt out of the interlocal agreement for some of the people in this city you think that that may mean you don't have Beach rights rest assured I know what the law is we have deed Perpetual Beach rights they can burn the interlocal agreement and we're still allowed to go to the beach the interlocal agreement deals with how lots are matag basically says b beach is going to maintain them issue parking passes and I believe we're uh responsible we were responsible for patrol well they H they got on something here and they've been talking about this for a long time by the way they were talking about this when I was mayor difference is I let my Council know about it what are they talking about doing talking about that thing out of that interlocal agreement they're talking about cutting off your parking so you be able to park there anymore so in other words pay them their money or we cut off your parking I live 150 ft from the beach I can give a damn if they cut off the parking personally don't look for me to fight it for you we have plenty of loyers and WN to be lawyers in this city who knew everything about this so get ready to fight it yourself but here's my problem if you send them this money okay we are not at in a position where this is the end of this this insurance bill has went up permanently it's not going down and there may very well be more litigation I'm not too thrilled with their new law and there's a bunch of citizens some of whom have retained me that are not that thrilled about it so if you're going to pay for this you're going to be paying for a lot more I'm going to tell you the words when I brought this up with our former City Attorney Fred Riley Fred Riley looked at it he heard what I had to say and he said said hell no that's what you have to do folks you need to go back to Bell Beach the people that you told you loved the people that want to trample our beach rights and you need to tell them hell no we're not paying this and you want to opt out of the inter local agreement good you maintain the lots and you do everything else and if it means they shut off parking then maybe somebody will defend that maybe they can do it and maybe they can't do it this is never going to end and I'm getting sick and tired of coming here begging this Council so you look at this and you say we'll do whatever we want that's what I heard last time we won the election we'll do whatever you want well just remember I can do whatever I want too I urge you to"
