    "transcript": "go ahead and get started this is the city council work session it's 6 p.m on april 18 2022 i will go ahead and get started with item one which is to discuss scheduling a lot of time i'm so sorry i'm off my game right now let's do pledges one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all all right patty would you call the role please council member frank banker councilmember lloyd roberts councilmember jody shirley your councilmember mike sable your vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gaddis city manager lynn reeves city attorney andrew salzman and council member leslie notaro was unable to attend i apologize for that this uh sounds a little weird it's uh it's very yeah i don't think we should have turned them off and on it's just uh we'll we'll deal with it i think as time goes on we'll figure it out all right so it's item one uh to discuss scheduling a lot of time and completion date to fully review the city's strategic plan i added this because it's something that we in the last year pretty much lost we weren't really paying much attention to it there were a lot of distractions and and i feel like this is something that needs some attention so [Music] my reason for putting it on here is is to come up with some sort of a plan that we could go through this thing make some modifications and then get back on track with following the strategic plan um i'm open to suggestions just as a background let me raise that i sit down on a weekly basis and kind of look and update the objectives and stuff like that never change we've reordered some of the goals based on the council discussions we've had previously uh we start with a review of the typical swat stuff strengths weaknesses opportunities and friends that's a good starting place we've been through the assumptions and there doesn't seem to be a lot of change there i've included a list of the old assumptions and believe it or not i can go through it i think we'll see if not a whole lot that's probably gonna change but then i can get i can get out of copies of uh the updating objectives and stuff and that they can kind of go through the long university leave priority ties just kind of yeah you think it's something we can get through in one or two meetings [Music] well that's pretty much nothing's changed that's the actual existing strategic plan the reason i have gone through and that had kind of a list of agendas attached to it and obviously it's kind of outdated so as we've scratched things off the to-do list we've moved other things up so that's that's pretty much it but if you look at the core values if you look at the assumptions if you look at the [Music] just kind of go through the assumptions and the strengths and weaknesses first and then i can hand out the updated list of objectives we typically only deal with one or two at the same time because we don't want to overwhelm ourselves and then attached to that there's a list of some things if everybody is adept enough i could ever drop the brief right now can you wait until we have our ipads back but eventually we need to decide to join the 1990s i just want to make sure it sounds like you're preparing the assumptions um the ground rules for a review of the existing strategic plan or not over home the strategic plan i don't think so unless but you know i think you have to take into consideration we've got new council members and i think they all came with a agenda in their head that will obviously change with time but they have some priorities now so i think we need to as a baseline you know the whole purpose of the strategic plan is to baseline all of us and we all think to say what's what's the number one goal what's goal number last and where will we start dealing with budget line items well does that take a priority or not and also kind of laying out how we will implement the strategic plan because right now it just sounds like we're bouncing around so i want to come out of the meeting with specific okay here's the target here's the day your user's responsible to move on okay we did one two coming up some of those are not accomplished i mean they're kind of steady state goals but you know whatever is accomplishable want to get dates associated with it yeah if you look through uh again you know we had the old we had five target goals they were rearranged by the one of the prior council goal number one public safety health number two tax dollar value uh communications the community aesthetics of water okay and against each one of those we've listed some objectives like for number one address and we're gonna do it street flying issues emergency generated funding acquisition investigation tax dollar value master's two-legged plan analyze duke versus solar integrate the uh comprehensive not the comprehensive but the capital improvement plan the budget in greece graphic we're talking about cold blood traffic monitoring council chamber audio visual artificial turf ordinances each reversal so within each goal we only have really one or two objectives at a time because we don't want to spread ourselves too thin here and as we scratch one off we have kind of a laundry list or a brainstorm list and occasionally we just sat down because we can't typically get the entire council that we're involved in our work section so we just kind of sat down and said okay well what fits the next priority in there so that's kind of what he's been working on he's been making great progress that's uh that is working well and uh and it should be what we're doing however we do have a new council and so we want to make sure that uh everyone's goals are still on in alignment with that strategic plan and if not then where do those goals fit which will lead us into uh number two of the uh the agenda tonight which is everyone's goals what are you trying to accomplish so the approval then what i'll do is i'll get this copy out to everybody and if you want to give me a date at a time i will kind of facilitate and do a quick walkthrough and then i'll kind of facilitate the brainstorming section for them what's your number one goal what's your number and i'll send you the the most recent list with what we accomplished it was updated i want to say in january or february and what it should have is it should have uh any any goals that are currently in progress and then what hasn't started yet and then what you know what's what's next on the list what's coming in the future so that if we decide that maybe we should move some things around i think for the most part bellaire beach is relatively simple and we're going to have the same repetitive goals over and over and over and it's just it's what i consider the nuisance goals are the ones that where do you fit them into that yeah i just want to make sure that the public knows that each and every step of the way these are what are out there and current status so they can ask hey what's going on well it's already on board here at city hall i like that all right um so what do we think is a relatively reasonable time frame you think month month from now so we have we have one work session next month and we'll add it to the calendar and we'll just see if we can focus on that and knock it out everybody good with that yeah okay great all right so uh obviously number two uh there's a uh it's compile a list of expected goals from each council member to be considered in a future work session that ties right in with a strategic plan but also some of these things may be um they may just be like i said nuisance problems that we can just uh low-hanging fruit we can take care of them and make them go away pretty quickly i don't know what everyone else what conversations they've had with the citizens recently but there were a few things that came up and some of them are already being addressed but compiling the list did everyone bring something did anyone bring something that they wanted to add to the list right quick and then we'll we'll figure out how to prioritize that list and uh get it in the hands of vice mayor gunn i have nothing right now this week though okay so you want to send it directly to the vice mayor the senator i think it has to go to pay yeah and and i think everyone will get a copy of that but um once it's all once everything's in then the vice mayor can compile it and come up with some sort of a strategy to apply to the city strategic plan so we need a deadline on that i'm open to what since we're having the work session for the strategic plan and sometime next month maybe two weeks would be reasonable yeah i don't even think it'll take that long most of us already know what's what's to be expected but uh and those would be the items that would be discussed at the next stop we would bring it in with this city strategic plan and before you send yours i'll send lines you can review mine and take a look at it because you may just say oh it's over there you just need to modify it or something like that or the ongoing issues not necessarily yours beyond the strategic plan right it's already in place yeah yeah i don't want to misinterpret it but it's just your idea you know like it's true when will you send yours uh i can send that by yeah i will have that out before the end of the week well i already had my old ass but you know i said i already had my whole list here but i'll sit in the pan you're an overachiever yes it is all right that was relatively painless now let's move on to these boats in the water discussing vessel mooring in the inner coast and these are the ones this is an item that would be on the strategic plan because i think we talk about waterfront safety and that sort of thing but clearly our ordinance doesn't allow for it but it continues to go on we've got two vessels along the causeway here that have been there for several months and then one that comes and goes quite frequently i know one of them had a sticker on it i couldn't get close enough to see what it was but a big red sticker on the side um the other one i don't know if the person's living on it the other vessel that does have a mast uh also has a dinghy they come in the shore with their dinghy or bring the boat in close enough so on low tide it's like on its side and they just walk in so there's we do have it's in our code i don't know how we enforce what's in our code and so that's why i kind of wanted to bring it to the attention of the council and see how we proceed and lynn might be able to give us some some more information yeah the boat that's got the broken mask the sticker is it's going to be taken away i asked the sheriff to go out and get pictures with the vessel numbers on it and he's trying to get that scheduled recently there's a canoe out there we're trying to figure out if that's even allowed because it's anchored it's just the news anchored yeah it's a small one i i spun around it yesterday taking a look at it yeah it's on a it's on an anchor yeah because it's you know and uh so captain liner said he would try to get the marine i said either that or just schedule something for one of the staff to go out because we've done that with them before and he'll take pictures get the message they can run who owns it and andy and i talked about the possibility of claiming as a nuisance so that's where we're at right now but the sheriff has said in the past that there isn't anything he can do about it but if we claim it as a nuisance we'll go the two ways to enforce it are obviously we contracted with the sheriff's office and the statute provides that they would be one of the entities that would go out and enforce it the second way of doing it as lynn mentioned is we could have it declared a nuisance bring it to the special magistrate and in order for uh for us basically to abate that nuisance then your choices are hire somebody to go out and pull it in the process is basically we try to get the value of the boat and then determining on the value the city decides whether or not to destroy it and we at least have a record of what the value was in case somebody ever comes back but that process usually is long enough so that if somebody really wants their boat they're going to come and if they're not it'll be just destroyed so those are a couple different options or we can bring it in and store it charge them again a lot of times they're all probably well aware that anybody leaves their boat out there is probably not going to either have the money to pay for it or they don't care or they've left the area and then it becomes just uh and we don't want to get in litigation on these because you just spend a whole bunch of money and we don't get any satisfaction but if we do it as a nuisance and we're allowed to abate the nuisance that's the cheapest way for the city to move forward to have the boat removed at least from the waterways now didn't the county uh release some funds to take care of that that's that's what's happening with like that woman with a broken mask that's one of the boats that's going to be is this kind of a one shot clean up the county and then and then they're done or is this is pretty much it's a hundred thousand dollars that you're spending but that's on your step is on the list it's not much money right compared to what they need no you know i think i don't think what i'm seeing with these boats there is a person that's going to them of course not the broken mass one and i haven't seen anybody go to the canoe it's just been sitting there for a couple weeks uh i have seen someone going to the one that's tilted over and over here the same thing and then there's a i call it a cabin cruiser that pulls in over here and then he leaves for a few days and he comes back and pulls back in uh the problem i have with with the cabin cruiser they're not they're not dumping they're they have to be dumping in our water that's right and then in marriage you know that's the way to also to enforce these it's through the sanitation provisions of the statute and that the sheriff should be doing i guess it's just up to us to notify them but there's well if we get this aside well no there's three over here pretty much stay around the island you know party island down there and then there's uh the broken mass the sailboat and in the last two weeks this canoe that showed up and then that cabin cruiser it's there and then it's gone for a couple days and it comes back well he's there and then he goes up off of bel air and then he goes to the upside so he moves it around often enough that it's not an issue you know that it's not no one catches on but and just to that do we maybe need to review our code to have some provisions for you're not being pumped out if you can show us documentation that you've been pumped every 30 days you know that's one way but i can guarantee there's no pump out on any of these vessels they're dumping overboard which is illegal within three miles of the shoreline vice mayor you know we're not we're not unique in this problem i flew yesterday and i mean they're tucked in there behind the gloves you go north of honeymoon island and kaladesh i mean there's a fleet up there [Music] we're not unique in this problem so my question really or concern is is with the big c is there a unified way to address this problem is everybody else willing to throw money towards the solution or rather than just taking on this battle ourselves you know going into dunny for years up until about last year when you cleaned it up you had so many boats listed listing in there and stuck in the mud and all of a sudden it disappeared something something's happening but we don't have that something's happening uh something's happening budget yeah but what she said i think it's a growing problem there was a new person that a new entry next door a new resident of bel air beach and whenever she listed her address it was actually there and she she was living on the boat and claiming to be a bel air beach resident so obviously the dynamic is changing more and more people are just saying i'm going to live on this boat and i expect it to get worse before it gets better little boards have more protection for the purpose but how do we get those i'm sorry how we get those the same way dump it that's how you get rid of the liveaboards that are dumping right into the water how far is our jurisdiction going here in if it uh if it's a liveaboard and it will not crank there's no way to get that pumped out so that it has to has to be moved somehow and then who picks up the tab on that and that's the problem in other clients that have dealt with it they pay for it and they usually even if you get the value for the destruction you're losing money fair amount but right now we have one that's a problem that doesn't look like it'll move on its own right the others we can push them out can't we i mean madeira beach from what i'm told did crack down and that's why we have an issue here and ballard bluffs now and no one in the county who should you know the sheriff's not doing anything about it half the time you can't use the boat ramps because i mean i don't want our backyard to turn out like feller gloves is well she said we attacked this one right now aggressively maybe it cooked everything else but you are correct that's what's happening when one city cracks down and they just hit it and then all right we'll see if we do code enforcement and send a letter of a nuisance you know that would be the first step if we send it as a nuisance is a violation then after you've notified them if they don't move it then you schedule a hearing with the magistrate and we can we can lean them once there's a fine that's not paid or they do not remove it so we will have a lien on their property assuming they have something that we can find and we get judgment that's good for 20 years so the biggest problem you're going to run into is most of that is not anything that's of any value it's right it's junk and unfortunately that's what you see in most of these harbors is junk junk and occasionally somebody's living on the junk once it causes something like that to pull it out destroy it is there i don't know off the top of my head and find out because gulfport does it i can find out yeah let's find out and then decide whether we need to actually add a line item in the budget for this project because we're going to have to find it somehow and i guess the first step is find out how much and what we can legally do and then establish a budget and start enforcing it learn and follow that we also ask the local governments as well what do they do the lessons learned right well i can tell you i can tell you like i think it was treasure island they shrunk their i'll call it more league they're more they they shrunk it they're trying to get them out of there but even treasure island says because i talked to their marina people about this some time ago said you can't control it he said first of all we don't have the boat or the equipment to go out and do anything about it and so that's a problem because their ornaments kind of mirrors a little bit of ours that says you can war for 72 hours only in a 30 day well if this is the story they told me what they do is they move 10 feet and they're not moored in the same spot so there's anything you do about it clear water they don't do anything about it we had this we had a big meeting in gulfport probably had 70 plus people that will little boards or supporter of the boards the same type of argument we'll just move it a few feet we know how the rules are you're not treating us fairly and eventually push but it's just because it's uh i don't want to say it's a harassment of them it's when people are out there at least checking on them they don't want to do that all said the dumping those things so once they're being checked on then they start moving to another place but it's just keeps coming around but i think then back to our ordinance too you know maybe we should say unless you're a resident you know unless you're a property owner in battle beach you can't warn there is no warning in belle beach i mean that's you can clearly clean that some of that problem up by just working on our ordinance you know there might be something and this is going back when you might remember this remember the coast guard auxiliary they were mandated they could do safety inspections and if we had coast guard accelerator because your their gas is kind of paid for taxes but they could kind of basically do the enforcement just that we're just checking for offshore discharge because that's coast guard territory and the coast guard auxiliary they're a non-cost it's a volunteer organization but again i was affiliated with them like 25 years ago i don't know what they're doing now that might be they're still around that might be one of those little things just let them do the that quote the hassling and if they don't like it they'll tend to move i will reach out to the various mayors up and down the beach and see what they're doing and see if i can get some feedback from them i think whatever we do it's not going to be perfect but we can certainly become a nuisance in ourselves you know make it where if you're going to be here in our waters you're not going to like it very well of a loser yeah a loose sailboat hit the power lines and caused some problems for him all of these coast guard boat stations basically report to the second commander in the city and maybe as a group the big c bears may want to touch base with a sector commander i mean he's probably more likely to respond to a letter for an invitation to lunch or something with the big c to address some of these uh maritime issues you call them the sector [Music] all right well we've got we have some homework to do hopefully we'll be able to come up with something it's got to be better than what we're doing now anything else on this topic no okay let's move on to general business i would like to go back to the city manager position we had several things that were turned in and created and edited and we'd like to discuss that especially since we're just cruising right through this meeting did everyone get a copy of the pre-screen any feedback on that this was taken directly from our ad that we have posted and uh shrunk it down yeah it wouldn't fit on a page whenever whenever i credit it anyway so what i did was i looked at the education and the experience and then location as is really the top three top three scoring items and then you had all the granulars to add to that so it would give you a if this was the perfect candidate they would have a a score of 40. this was i just threw it out there that's kind of the way that i saw it but i would like to hear what others think about it and if there's something that maybe we should change or or was everyone good with this the only thing i'd recommend is taking names off of the details the specific details to the person off these usually when they do employee rankings or they do screening like this they'll assign a number and whenever you see any material you see a resume it has a number on it not a name because you can you know people can be biased against a different spelling of the front first name and that kind of removes any perceived bias on our part so if we have a number whenever we go to the interview section of hiring how do we know what they scored would we know that at all i would say that when they come in there look you're not getting the name just your number your everything associated with that one candidate his number so okay candidate number one can you come please come in we have candidate one's resume again the name is taken off um and we review it strictly on that you can just address him as candidate and when we mark down candidate one okay meets public administration here's our point standing what i'm trying to do is remove any perceived notions of bias or prejudice in the job search i don't know how you do that when you have people within the city who's going to be applying for the job involved some of us may have local friends we've asked to apply there's a lot of problems with names and things now but i think this is just too small well i think the initial part is you've got to go through the applications and you can you can do something like that keep it isolated and wherever but when you get to the shortlist and send out the invites i think we want to get a little more personal with people right you know at that point you know the gig's up you know without the five people come on in and tell us something about yourself where you're from and then we're going to probably ask some questions and give you a scenario or something i understand but i got to go back to when you originally brought to something from the board tonight i pulled you up short he kept talking about him him and him and we can't afford that sure yeah that's awesome so my idea on this was not uh for something that we would use what we have how many applicants do we have now 11 12 12 we got another one yeah so we have 12 applicants um this is something that if we lighten the scoring system i would like to throw this over to the citizen advisory board and let them narrow it down rank all of the applications resumes everything and give us their top five and then we go from there what does everyone think about that idea i think it's kind of becoming to kind of back them up i think they should have an independent shot at five i think we should get to look at the whole package too because if we get five and say you know my number six guy you know he didn't even make the list you know i saw this that i thought was interesting but he discounted it so i think there just needs to be an independent back up here i agree with that view i just don't want to i mean i want to make sure that whenever we task a committee that we actually take into consideration what they're recommending because they're the ones you know on the ground we'll still look at the remaining resumes and packages you know to further inform ourselves of everything but we really need to rely a lot on what they are bringing to us and and that was the kind of the purpose of this was to give a first-round elimination so that we we've got what what they think is best um i think most times i know from where i came from we had a big hr department we don't that's okay but there's always going to be a percentage that don't need the required items so they they by definition are eliminated so we have some items on our advertisement as well as our job description so if it says required you have to wear a blue hat and they don't have a blue hat they're out so they're off the table immediately and then what's left you know that's when you're going to sit down and either us or the other group shortlist what's left to whatever number we think is is a good number and then we go through the interviewing process that's that's the way i always say judy i just to the list i have some some questions for some additions i think they're kind of important we don't talk about the paving storm water utilities underground utilities repairs and maintenance things that we want that we have ongoing in the city and i think that needs to be added to part of what we um they require someone have experience with and you know maybe the floodplain and nbdes management could be part of the same category we're just trying to categorize stuff but i'm just i just think that uh that's a big part of the job and that's where you know kind of wind shines when we're talking about needing someone to take over this position right he'll be covered under your demonstration yeah public works contract construction public works operations okay that's fine i just don't i don't want to overlook that that's all i just what i was trying to accomplish was that okay we definitely have an education requirement we have a city manager or comparable experience and you see if it's comparable then you rank them zero to five instead of just a five because the first two you you automatically score top if you if you've been a city manager or an assistant city manager but comparable okay well what was close and that's where they're going to have to do a little thinking and decide where where the weighting is on that same goes with education uh and then of course you get bonus points for uh doing that job in florida and even more if it was on a beach so those things were the most important and then you you've got all of these granular things where you may not have any experience with with grants at all but you've got all of these other things so i didn't really think that that dinging somebody because they were missing one of the important one of the important items certainly it may be their first time that they'll have to deal with a community that has these requirements but lynn you had to figure it out somewhere right [Laughter] so um so that's kind of where i was going and what i'm looking for is what are we missing is there anything we're missing um is there anything that that we should absolutely add that's not on here or do you is there any of the weighting that that you think should be more important or less important because right now it ends in 40 and we can make it 700 if we need to how will this dovetail with the interview i mean that's the second part right so we go through the applications we grade them and come up with the shortcuts then we have to combine something like this the evaluation from the written application with the interview process so [Music] that's that's part b of this evaluation thing and then is it going to be weighted 50 50 60 40 i mean that's to me that's just the last piece of the puzzle here i think this is a great start it covers all the bases and i think we've awaited the demonstrated experience properly and then the next thing is we go to an interview process we articulate this equipment can you relate to people answering you or she gotta break before it gets done you know i thought about that and yeah people might say yeah i've got an experience well okay we'll show us a report or something to be ready you know i mean show us some demonstrable thing to prove that you've done it you honestly i'm sorry but i'm thinking that just by asking questions they should they should immediately be able to answer exactly what they did to back up these abilities and uh and i don't say that i don't think it would require just showing us a certificate that i completed this so this will be not at the resume review stage but their first interview was saying the uh if if we have a top five those those are the people that will that we'll um drill into a little more yeah and ask and provide they'll cut down to five then those five will come to us with the originals and we'll drill in yeah i'm thinking we get whatever the score is exactly and we see what the check boxes are that they were able to fill in and we have the resume and we call them in for an interview ready to go with some some uh some important questions and then the timeline for the questions right there's not no need to really go to another i mean this if you're going down this list it means that they had a high level score on a certain category and we can ask them questions you know i wouldn't i envision us all in the same room and one person tagged with asking the questions and then we would fill in anything that doesn't get answered right or things that do get answered yes that's the show or if there's a fresh intention i mean to take the score out of course give the potential candidate all these questions here or all these items here and say these will no it's uh this is this is strictly for bel air beach and uh the citizens advisory board and uh i don't think so i don't think they'll ever see this at all but we will happen while we're interviewing the the various candidates and is is five enough five too little yes to answer your question earlier glenn when you were saying okay now we've completed this and then we go to the interview process my recommendation would be that whatever number we pick whether it's five whether it's three and we've chosen those based on the scoring system my recommendation would be at that point that all of those candidates are solid this goes away this is gone then we have the interview process so we know we're dealing with three candidates or five candidates that are very strong from an experience standpoint an education standpoint and then we interview and then from that i don't think these scores come back in it gets too complicated and it really doesn't matter because we know they're solid then we're going to interview them and then we as a council are going to decide who the person is from that standpoint um i think when julian was talking about you know what's the best way to handle this i mean we can do we could have the committee do a phone interview just to verify so at this time we have the resumes in hand and their experience a lot of these questions can probably be answered already just based on those documents if not just to confirm and reconfirm and have them tell us that for example the question is tell me your experience with um budget operations and they say yeah i have plenty of them well what is it you know via a phone interview and so then these points are kind of finalized i think based on a combination of a phone interview if necessary and resume total of the points and then and that committee is going to be made up of some of the council members as well right or like glenn was recommending maybe we do it also but i think the combination of the committee and a couple of council members makes sense too and so then we go in i was going to say my preference is i want to know where the guy's strengths are and his weaknesses are because i want to ask him a question i want to confirm his friends and then i want to ask him questions about his weaknesses because if he if he's just completely lacking there and he [Music] okay tell me something about budgie what you what'd you do in bloodshed or what have you done in pdes management i'm not saying we don't need it anymore i'm just saying that that score we may not want it to be applicable for the final decision making process you can still use that and ask questions during the interview i think a great plan because if you want to answer certain questions go write it down bring that sheet that sheet should be removed in the last it's uh it's especially the score but this what i see with this is this will give me a guideline of what to ask because i'm going to see zeros in some places and fives and some others right so now how does this are we in agreement with that is there anything i need to change on this or are everybody pretty happy with this part [Music] and what about the citizens advisory board do we is everybody satisfied with just giving them the pre-screening job yes because i was not i didn't really think that any of us should be daring we should be in that that portion of the selection process i agree because it also gives the citizens a chance to really make us all the recommendations so they would be the ones to score this yes so the candidates that met the they're going to look and look at the resume the application whether they make a phone call or not i don't know maybe that's our responsibility once we is your intention to give us all the resume before you go to the [Music] and say bring us your top five and whenever we get that top five we also get the resumes and all their work history everything that they gave to the citizen advisory committee the exact same data so now we're looking at why they selected these guys as the top five and then we could start in our own minds narrowing down what is it we're going to ask each candidate because i'm assuming that we're all going to take turns and we're going to be called on one at a time and ask you know a question and go around until we're satisfied the council won't be able to trump that advisory board by saying now i think candidate so-and-so should be included in that it will be whatever the citizens admire i would think that that would be fair enough that that's that because they've already proven to be very sharp and they've done some some great work for us already and it'll keep us from getting bogged down in the weeds again this is just some initial thoughts but if we this is a council so we can do whatever we want but i'm trying to make it as streamlined as possible and i trust those guys yeah that's on purpose i mean you got to start here because we have other commissions too look we're delegating the work and the responsibility so we're going to accept what they come forward with again we're making the guidelines but they're coming back if we say five okay they'll come back with a the five and i'll tell you what what we could do is reserve the right to reject anybody and make them give us another one and then that way it keeps it fair i like that i can go for that i think if we do decide on a number like if we seem to be fixed on five which sounds great if the advisory committee was struggling one way or the other if they had a sixth candidate as an example i think it would be okay and we would prefer five but tell them look you're struggling to try to cut five and six it's okay or if you're struggling to get five then give us four something like that just so they have some flexibility in there but five sounds and a lot of depends on i think how many candidates we get right you know we get i'm sorry you could just have a rank of one through twelve and then you ultimately make the decision how many you want so you see those numbers you'll see the natural right and you'll and of course you can decide if you want to go down the six or only you know go to three we could do that i i think it's important that we see all the resumes and that we you know even if they are all ranked out but it's our duty as elected officials to be actively involved right and so even though we do have this committee that's helping us with that selection process i think it's up to all of us to make sure we look at all those resumes just my field okay which brings up i took a course the other day that was put on with this fine gentleman so i took the opportunity because i had i'm the rookie here with the amount of time in the city so i had not a lot of experience or opportunity to work with kyle so today i went in there did not interview kyle but we had a great conversation for about an hour because i wanted to know him better i wanted to know um what he thought how he works in the city what his previous work relationships were that type of thing so i'm letting you guys know that because i was told in the meeting earlier i'm supposed to do that when i have information that could be valuable and shareable to you guys so i can just tell you this short story is after after meeting with him i feel fairly confident that he would be a great choice with possibly not going through this process that would save a lot of time and energy and work by all parties concerned we're always going to get that pushed back by people that say well you may not you may have missed out on the opportunity of somebody who's just unbelievable and what does that mean unbelievable you know it's very subjective term so i just wanted to let you guys all of you know the whole council that i took that opportunity to spend some time with kyle i know we had the meeting over in the other room and we were talking about the city manager's resignation of retirement but at that point i didn't really feel one way or the other because i didn't know kyle that much i can tell you that on a lot of the doors that i knocked on around the city unsolicited that wasn't everybody of course because not everybody knew that our current city manager was considering retiring but some did because they unsolicited to me when i would ask him what are some of the things you want me to work on if i'm fortunate enough to be elected and some people would say well we know the city manager is leaving i think kyle would be a great city manager those type of comments came back from the citizens so just letting you guys know that it yeah my point uh this is i mean to me it's a legal call i mean did we get a problem with pre-selection now no you did you're having this discussion at the public meeting and act as my student well that's why i want to make sure because what i think is appropriate is that everybody's getting the same information so you all know this interview or informal interview took place you all know the feeling of one of the council members regarding that and their suggestion so you're you're having all the same information deciding however you want to move forward okay is it my experience in private companies that would have been shut down well that's right it's different in the public okay if we do everything in the sunshine so we the transparency is is the most important thing that you all will do thank you i've seen him at uh almost every public function that we've had for the last couple of years at least employees here all considered very fair unless it's in your charter differently you can handle this process however you choose and i think i might have mentioned that before you can do what you continue doing what you're doing you could set at your next meeting somebody can make a motion in a second and you could approve kyle if that's what you so choose it's whatever the council wants to do it's your own process physically too well originally whenever we had this conversation we i don't think it was unanimous but i think the majority agreed that we still owe it to the city to try to find the very best candidate for this job and he has a home-field advantage i can say that but that's what we agreed upon and here we are now have we changed our minds well sometimes you can't see the forest because of the trees like i said before we're not hiring a vote or a supreme it doesn't court by saying hey a year ago you promoted me to the assistant he gave me a raise uh what do you like yeah well i think he's mature enough and been around in public service long enough to recognize there are duties of a public body and elected officials to go through the motions and you know i think everybody here probably believes he will compete on equal fields but as our council says he's sure enough to understand it says it's our decision uh we're gonna have to we're gonna have to decide on something so let's just let's let me get feedback on from everyone right quick on where you stand yeah you would ask you know have people change their mind i changed my mind from that meeting only because i had the opportunity to get to know an impression so so right now um based on the work involved and more importantly what a good job i think i would do i would support selecting it jody i am not afraid of the work i think one thing that comes to mind is that we've got 12 resumes in hand right now it doesn't make sense that as those come in they're distributed to the council so we can start reviewing them and you know kind of get a jump on that review process i know we can't make any decisions or anything like that because we haven't done you know we have a job that they will need to take the last one but at least we can get a four week jump on them so that would kind of be a question back to the council but i think it's our duty to review all the resumes as i said earlier and make a decision based on that mike i agree i mean we should go through the process um from everything i heard about him he'll probably walk all over the competition but we can safely say yeah he walked all over the competition we compared him against 12 and without a doubt this is the one to select but we should go through the process frank my feelings is kyle's a perfect candidate i understand we have 12 resumes the problem is now are we going to waste those 12 resumes times by coming in here doing an interview process where we probably know who's going to get the job we're building up hopes falsehoods i just don't think it's at least a service that's where i'm leaning to is going through the process so i think that this is the right direction if we are not comfortable with allowing the citizens advisory board to do this job for us then i'm all for us doing it ourselves i was trying to help us but um let's let's do that right quick yeah i think we're going to go through the process i think it's a great idea to use the is all right so we will uh we'll get those over to the citizen advisory board and we will let them give an initial ranking rather than giving us five we'll just get scores from all of them all right how many people are on the advisory committee that's great these days excellent good mix don't we still have an opening uh i'll draw it now alternate that's right okay uh now what about the timeline right well really the timeline attaches to the 23rd that's the view that once you hit that due date that's when he cranks in unfortunately when i did it it even allowed me to say i guess two days because i don't have a pronoun um it still puts start date potential with a 30-day notice in august i think i actually did print that out i think they thought it was at the last meeting though that there's not a big concern because of the opportunity to go ahead and put kyle in as the interim when the current city manager moves on so that was you know well that was true and we did discuss that and uh i just really this was one of the action items and i appreciate you doing that and is there anything obviously what i'm going to ask you to do for me is take it back and now that we understand the the pre-interview process and what the citizen advisory board is going to do can you put that into this timeline and then get it back to all of us were there any items in parallel that can be done see everything looks sequential there's just one it wasn't a bunch of once you hit the 23rd that was the real time because everything else you know at the same time but you know oh yeah ms project all right uh and there was one more uh we're to the job description of the city manager i went through that thing and uh the original job description uh you know it had the job somewhere here and i said and why are we writing that the job description is right in the city charter article three and second i mean there was actually some misalignment between the wording that was using the job description and the chart he's the chief administrator and there are a couple other things in there you can kind of leisure and some of them were in different places and i tried to consolidate orlando across the valley and put emphasis on demonstrated experience not just this subjective knowledge of some things so if the guy says he's done something well what did you do so that's all i can do and maybe go back and take a look at this thing along with the job description there was some questions about outrageous salary i i was able to pull up an old copy of computer city here from when he went through the last hiring his dad is old i have a calling updated where i'm going to go back into these were the cities the lesson was actually like 76 so he said i paired it down to just the council manager forums of the government and the copy of the spreadsheet you have the list is actually the spreadsheet's about this log and it goes into how many part-time equivalents do you have a water utilities you have police smarter all that stuff i just paired this down and sorted it strictly by population taxes levy the number of employees and the salary just to give us an idea of the range of salaries and again go back and look at the taxes levy the size of the population and the number of employees and you should kind of be able to come up with something kind of salary yeah i think the one thing that i see missing from this is cost of living based upon where all of these communities are we're in one of the most expensive areas in florida [Music] i can go back and i can actually send out the entire spreadsheet maybe somebody can identify a field that you can kind of infer what the cost of living is in that area yeah that's uh i'm not real sure i'd like to see it though if you could pass that off to patty and everyone gets a copy of it that would be some good day to have all right we want to run through these uh essential functions right quick make sure everybody's on the same page before we do does anyone need a break 708 okay okay so we are all essential functions uh why why is this crossed out at the very uh above essential functions uh that was the part of the initial job summer okay what we had all right i mean that was it okay again it's all specified in the charter let's see what the job continues yeah exactly and that's that was uh my thoughts initially also was that it's right there and if we go changing too much guess what exactly it goes to an election and there's nothing essential functions are just kind of the subjective kind of things oh yeah what about this black and white have you seen this yet just uh what a couple hours ago a couple hours ago did you have time to digest it or yeah i kind of looked through it i mean i guess i was a little like what do we put the charter in there for but that's because typically that's not a job description but but changing a couple of words around i think that's fine i think they're okay are we missing some important points now i i had edited the one that the consultant did a couple years ago and put a couple of additional things in there so i think we covered that changing the word from knowledge to demonstrate it or experience that that makes sense and it's probably good that you know people don't realize that some cities don't have a strategic plan we do and we've been working off of it for you know objectives for the last few years so you know that's something important that someone needs to know but some of the things i try to stress is to say he's a tactical and routine guy he gets stuff done he works with the council to develop the high level of organizational goals and objectives but he's clearly the guy who puts that into process and makes it happen he takes lead and all the implementation that's done he's the primary liaison for all emergencies to prepare this coordination with all the other agents in federal state accounting and he's responsible for keeping the council staff performance and taking time to actually necessary he monitors all the progress costs it keeps the accounts advised of any significant deviations as well as what's a good recommended course of actually gets back on track trying to stress the communication skills he's the prime uh ambassador dealing with the residents the county and also our neighboring municipalities coordinates tiny quarterfinals and boards and they tend to make sessions another stuff which has demonstrated the experience i think it looks good i think we need to be sure that we take these updates and revise the um you know because the evaluations do go hand in hand with that so this goes back to the initial pre-screen yes no anything on here translate over no i think that i think it it dovetails the pre-screen you know all we're trying to do to get this up on the website so when the guy says okay i've got the application i'm going to go do my due diligence about what i'm getting myself into with our beach and here's the job description i mean it's hanging out right there in the charter well here's some other things you want to think about do you have strong communication skills you have emergency disaster repairs a valid florida driver's license but it's necessary right i mean absolutely well basically you'll have to get one but if you're if you're a candidate you may not live in florida yet you may not check the florida box but you're still a candidate so does that automatically remove everybody that's from well this is a job description right so you know it means yeah you have to have one in the end yeah okay um you can't work if you're in the military you get double indemnity i think this is great i think it is going to be important though that we do identify the salary range because you know we say we have 12 applications or resumes some of those may go away when they find out what their range is i don't i don't know what the range is going to be but that could happen and like jody mentioned the other day when we put the range in everybody that applies well they're going to get the max because they're special so then a lot of times you can include that in there let's say typically the hiring range is between the minimum and 10 or something like that just so they know that's that's not the case so but that's i think we need to get that out of only because you know we don't want to bring people in for interviews or at some point they need to know what the range is so they can make a decision is this a fit for them momentarily i'll get that spread i'll update that spreadsheet the best i can with the latest salaries this is like 18 19 [Music] got it all right so uh let's see go back to my list here when can we have a salary range mr roberts oh so you've already got this data pulled i need to update the cell again that's 2018 2019 uh i've got a call-in [Music] uh well i think lynn was trying to find something that was similar in size and all that kind of neat stuff i don't know i i did see what glenn sent us i don't know that was definitely done by an outside firm yeah an executive placement firm where they talked about how many oak trees we have and sometimes yeah that was uh i had a discussion with rox again he said hey you know no one's going to bed right 15 20 grand go out and do this for you [Music] they're already looking i can tell you that they are what's that they're they're already asking about it they head hunters over oh yeah they're calling you daily that's because it's easy money and they can send you anyone yeah did that one give a range do you remember guys it wasn't just yeah up to about 200 is what's okay up to 110. this must have been an email so that's a nice way to say it because that way they know that's it that's the maximum that's the ceiling i'm not going over that whatever our number is i can tell you remington when they they went the ring was 235 they ended up paying 118. yeah well do you remember what the minimum wage or just i just said up to 90. so it's 90 to 200 and 735 i thought you said two yeah and that was about land how long ago a month ago so if you go to this spreadsheet here you look at the bottom here and you look at the number of residents you look at the taxes and you start looking at the number of reporting you can see that you know down towards the block 30 full-time employees but the taxes levy are kind of a range the number of residents you know 1900 to 18 [Music] and the rate doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot it's it's pretty much worthless data yeah number of employees so there's pillar of beach guy let's see on here but again that was back in 17 right so you guys probably gave him like a 10 raise every year is all right uh by friday got something all right just remember don't say anything directly so lynn do you have a feel for what the up to salary would make sense based on your knowledge what you know what goes on around there i think the range is probably somewhere between 90 and 110 okay 15 maybe you play a little bit i would i would guess it's probably on the higher side of the scale just because of the housing and fuel and everything else and how the cost of slaving is going yeah outside writing each just ran an ad and they're pretty you know city to us i mean i know they have more uh commercial properties every little bigger community but certainly it's a good so i mean if we're looking for a range that would be i mean you guys disagree that i think that would be the greatest to look at and you said they had advertised up to 135 but they hired 118 right okay well i don't think we need to put 135 on anything let's just say it all right we'll give us something back and then we'll go from there uh all right so what's the next step in this process um when is the citizen advisory board meeting again well you i would think we'd wait till all the i think we should probably have a meeting with them to kind of lay this out which you've laid out and we can do that rather quickly and then once all once the deadline passes we get all the applications uh patty's putting them together in a long book then we'll give them a package and then they will have some time to review and then take them and have some means to score okay i would suggest that somewhere along the line before you start bringing people in you do a phone interview because you may pick something up with who you know whether it's them or someone else and then of course you need to do the background investigation because you don't know what you're going to find well and if you hire them before you do that investigation now you're on the hook that's stuck with that person you make sure you do the backing and of course patty will probably do the due diligence of the google and the people and you'll have some articles that'll be patched so as far as having a pre-pre-interview with uh before bringing someone in what's going to be the best legal way of doing this without actually i mean do we have a public meeting and just do with zoom and then give everyone the address and you have to do that with every single candidate i mean i'll look at the exemptions but i think you actually have to do a lot of science well if we're wanting to pre-screen before we bring them in and you know have an on the phone interview with them um right okay i mean we can from a specific address we can we could probably just we'll have that as a public record but it'll be exempt um at this point i think we're okay with that yeah i think we're okay with that exempting that so you wouldn't necessarily have to ask some of those questions during the zoom here i would highly recommend that you do the interview yeah if you just want to see the person you want to see how they respond okay well maybe we could just have um maybe we just have one person who's actually asking questions and the rest of us are just sitting there watching and and then that way we we have canned questions we ask everyone and we just look look at the uh can you do zoom yeah yeah all right so we referring to that's the final interview no no this would be before they were brought in and i think just okay we've narrowed down these five or whatever we just have a phone call with them take a look at their face and see if we have if we've changed our minds about any of them yeah briefly yeah we talked earlier about the timeline right now we got that listed uh monday may 23rd you receive obviously a deadline you got those in but the initial call that's the the committee meetings i put five days so it's like from wednesday 5 25 through the 31st and they call it down i also have three days there to give a short list at that point the background and references check goes on that's a five day process and then i put aside two days for interviews so this is after it comes through a committee and it's now in our hands and then it goes to the final selection contract negotiation hiring it's like a five-day process so we can you know obviously that will adjust i think i think it's just i think it's going to take a little longer i think your you know and they have to have some time right you're and you're going to bring them in if they're coming in from out of state then you're going to have to do all those arrangements and things yeah so it's your uh gantt chart there is actually a sliding scale oh absolutely no i'll talk about upcoming tomorrow and start you know put more rational thought behind the experts thanks i think when we do this you know people to ask the questions and one charter you know charged with asking another one maybe do the follow-up or something like that i like it and the rest of us just observed right which one do you want to eat i'll be the best good questions too and if all goes well maybe we'll have a time to where we we interview everyone the same night and well it's all fresh in our mind and uh and then we'll make a final decision of if we're moving forward with background checks and then call them in for the the final interview uh and we make a decision sound like a plan yes sir what are your thoughts lynn no that's you've got a good plan i think you're right on the spot okay okay well um we talked about updating this job description that's coming read and we talk about the salary range do you want to include that salary range description before we put it on the website i think it should be on the website for sure okay so that's i'm just kind of thinking out loud for the deadline for that that will be probably probably the end of next week sometimes updating that i add may very well remove several candidates also well you're gonna you always get the shotguns and they'll say well this is what i make now and that's what you know you're gonna get that there's people that just if they're not working they just send them you know i would love that but even they're working process today so we you know just had a couple of questions i'm making this much therefore i should be making this much then you get there i'm making this much i should be making i know there's also been some discussion between the indian city manager about updating the hiring contract so i'm thinking that's something that's probably parallel it's not necessarily disappointing because this has to be done before the negotiations we'll have a problem for you anything else on the city manager position all right any other general business i have the addendum to employment agreement for you you put that on the okay all right did everyone receive a copy of this let's take a look right quick and see if there's any comments about it okay we will have this on the regular council meeting it says travel expense but it includes logic travel defense i don't need lodging i have a place here he gets kicked out [Laughter] all right any other uh you had something you wanted to discuss yeah i just um i spoke about the code fines and i the gentleman wanted to give me two thousand dollars patrick truman uh i i passed on what the concept said 50 and he came back to me and said uh of course he was still mad about the 100 landlord fee from three years ago uh but he wanted me to provide him a final invoice with the 50 so you know if i get some consensus from the console it's okay then if he does give us the 50 then i'll validate it at the constant meeting that amount is 14 435 dollars i will go along with that but i still want to look into the services just to see that not for this home let's look let's let this services where they where they buy the lien were they what where they buy the link to make things that that company that oh yeah i i haven't found the business card yet and i haven't looked but i will uh i will get at least two companies because i have two cards for them okay not not with this particular bill but i think we just want to look into the future and make sure that we're getting the most if if we can get 60 it's worth it everybody okay with that my concern with is buying a lien all of these are still active cases so there's not a solid lien yet i mean they're still incurring costs there's a there's a what we do is as they increase we have to give them 30 days after we give them a new invoice and then we can leave the property so he's got significant lean probably in the i'll say 26 000 roughly 25 000. he's got a lien already on the property and he knows that he wants to give you 2 000. no he wanted to give me 2 000. well his position was is he said that we're offering 2 000 because that's really probably all you spent in time and energy and i'm thinking no plus the headache so uh but for instance the gentleman whose house has been under construction forever that's an ongoing problem right so selling his lean doesn't solve the problem there may be there they may have something in place that that covers that that uh we wouldn't bring that case to you until they come in compliance or there's a point where they're just going to abandon the property normally we look for compliance to stop the lien and then you have a lien sitting out there that you're not out there then it's up to council if you want to negotiate what's a general building permit here how long do you have a ground break you have by our code you have 18 months but you can get a six month extension okay this is year four but this is numerous permits this is numerous permits is the problem is that it's it's missing specific steps right yeah and what what he agreed to when we took him to the magistrate and a year ago last january we gave him the magistrate gave him a drop dead date and the fine was uh i recollect 75 or 100 a day if you don't complete it by 31 august he wanted 30 september but she said no we're going in the middle because you've been back and forth with them because the city or me i said i'll give you six additional months but if he doesn't finish it then elite holds at that time he gave us a spreadsheet to say by this day i will have ruffian electric ruffian plumbing rough in you know inspection and the magistrate charged him for each one of those line items 25 a day if he didn't make it and he didn't make any money until just recently and his consideration has he had problems now i will say there they are over the last two or three weeks he's he's got someone else handling it and his brother has evidently took over the job and he's trying to get this house done so the story right now is july but who knows but he is totally aware that the code fine is what it is now is about a hundred and i think it was 125 000. living there yeah you can work a deal out with him he's done by july a certain date we can wash away a lot of these because i don't know that's my thoughts are is breaking the rules well i understand that but i mean giving him 50 off his uh one heck of a discount yeah i i don't i mean we've negotiated well i think you are yeah we've negotiated with other people and produced them over the years but we've always pretty much used that right around 50 rule and said hey you broke the rules so the biggest problem uh with that particular build is that he's got some angry neighbors they are they are sick and tired of it they have they have not liked this project pretty much from day one and it just seems like it's uh it's gone forever and i whenever i was knocking on doors people were saying can you do something about that and make this guy finish we put a fire under his feet does that not solve both of our problems by saying july is not too far away so he gets it done by july he owes usually what you say to those individuals is we'll address it once you complete it so you're in compliance then council will consider everything and that's how the best way you can do it to stop the fines i mean i've been dealing with code enforcement for about 30 years well if he's homesteading it no he's not always there oh well well not yet but he might he might yeah then you'd probably lean and then well no he's got to get a co right do we have a lien on him now yes okay yeah and then unless we talked about this well he's he's to to get a co he's going to have to take care of the co-pilot oh okay yeah so you're going to be in the driver's seat yeah and when we last spoke about this you were going to send letters to the rest of them we have three others i understand we're in the driver's seat now i think the car is out of gas well he was told that he could negotiate i mean i get a phone call two or three days a week now from just not from him but from his person that's kind of taking over the job is there any way to stop the fines i said yeah you can stop the fights so you know when they get a rough end now at least they're calling us and saying we gotta rough in and then we can verify with the county but that's all he's got so this is the one with the experience where you hit the deadline and he threw out all the fittings that he had installed to meet the device so at this point he's kind of flavor of the flower yeah he's been a struggle even the county thinks he's been struggling right now the only one we can solve is the one that you've got maybe the 50 percent yeah the others are really small you know in the scheme of things i think this house on the corner that's it's getting to find every day now for some reason they all think that they can negotiate and almost completely get out of it and i don't think bellar beach has ever i can remember one that was back in the late 2008-2009 i think we gave them 50 and they paid and uh actually was just around the corner from ukraine so where christy lives down and they wouldn't comply wouldn't comply but when they came for their co it was a problem and they couldn't get it till they agreed to something i have no problem working with with anyone but whenever you're just abusing abusing your neighbors and abusing our city that's actually had a couple of phone calls too about it hopefully this will motivate them and this will be finished soon so if you get the cards let me know i will any other unfinished business yeah i want to talk to i want to talk about um nourishment what's going on with nature nourishment are they moving forward or not no it's uh there's no funding in 24 currently what the issue is is eastmans clearwater and us have all the easements indian rocks doesn't need they can probably tell you who doesn't because they've talked about it but the corps of engineers just to give you a little background usually they work on a two-year budget and in their budget right now there's no money in the next two years which is 20 so then i'm going to make a proposal since we don't have anything moving forward with beach renourishment that we take back our city parking yeah why and what's our first can we have reviewed the contract to see the agreement residential parking at morgan park it's always filled up with right but it's a it's was put there for the parking spaces were for the renourishment and we've been around about with this about the county and according to the county person uh john bishop and the state it's 10 years from the last renourishment which is the last renourishment was 18 i believe so now if there's no renourishment in 20 20 28 right then yeah and i don't think that's going to that much six year cycle not with not with the city it's uh with the county board of engineers has a strategic plan they're supposed to be violent but they're not they're changing the rules so does she have the right can we at least take back some of it take back half of it so our residents have somewhere i mean you know then those people that are up in arms about the umbrella ordinance at least have somewhere they can go to park their car and go out to our beach with an adult we can go back to the county but this actually the county's the one you know we don't technically the city of bellar beach doesn't have a contract the county has that with the state and new orleans but it's not so we own the parking the county has given our parking away we haven't given it away well we gave it away so we gave it up we gave it up to get that sand and now the now the core of engineers has changed the rules requiring 100 percent across up and down the entire beach well if that's the case we will never ever get beach renourishment and so uh and the reason why is right across the street from us over there they are sure will not give up their parking lots for renourishment and there's no need for them to because you put it north you put it south guess what you've got sand if we're not getting beat your nourishment and you're watching it the problem because they can't get all the easements right um so now do we work something out with bellar shores by letting access to those three lives you know what i'm saying but not having access to this yeah the well the problem is is that the corps of engineers they want it all or not and um you go south of john's past and they're getting it because they got their act together and got everything signed i drove right past it yesterday and was shocked there was water we were at high tide but there was water up to several sea walls on the way down yeah from fourth from third just almost fifth it's really been arrowed and the big city and the county they've they've all been discussing various ways that they would try to do it but ultimately without the federal money it's it's not feasible and i it's one of the things that i did while i was in the in the last session was i organized a big petition and i was asking chris and rubio and scott to help us to step in and and just see if they could they could get the corps of engineers to work on the easements later and let's get it done and they didn't even care rubio chris scott no one person got back to me but it wasn't one thing it was it was some aid or something but that was signatures uh all the mayors up and down the beach including the ones in saint pete and uh treasure island where's it's not even any big deal of them and um i got the county involved also and they reviewed everything and they sort of twisted it a little bit but it was still an acceptable solution just give us the sand and then we'll work on the easements and we'll see what happens next year they just didn't give us enough time to really get this together and that goes with her argument because that strategic plan was written years ago about how many implements are saved and then they just come in and say oh we're not going to do unless we get 100 and they want it for life too so i i'm so well i think the way that that 10 years is okay you get it done one time and we get your property for 10 years so they got it they got they got their 10 years and just because we can't get them to do it again before that 10 years is up um what it's supposed to be for 2020 it was what was it like 2018 back to the strategic plan we probably should start researching putting in some barriers to keep our sand in place you know let's put that that's a great problem now you have a 10-year environmental study and then [Music] sand that flows down or you know because the sand moves right you need to remove the clear water jetty once that's done you'll get to see in transportation oh it'll still go i mean i've lived here this beach has never been without sand it might have been shorter but it comes and goes right i mean that's just mother nature all of our sand is at john's pass that's where it's all gone too it'll come back yeah they are complaining [Music] to get around to go into the inlet you can't follow the beach and turn right into each other's faces well just the county is the county is trying to talk to him about doing portions of it but that hasn't they don't seem to get an answer because because as an example us and clearwater we got all our influence well i think they're they're relying too much on chris to get something done for them i haven't seen any uh any progress yeah he's probably checked out because he's doing something else did you give me a copy of a letter yeah that that rubio inside and chris just signed no it was a letter that the mayor should sign the mayor's assignment oh you were asking ruby on those guys in the letter that's the latest that john bishop the person is my question is is i know it's not anything anyone ever wants to hear but what would an assessment be on every home in the county to get our beach reinerti that would be a i don't know if it was private well it wouldn't be enough for bellaire but i don't know what you're saying yeah i mean if we just did it ourselves but but i think actually still the corps of engineers has to be involved right but see we would now have funds instead of waiting on federal funds we would just pay for it ourselves they're fine with that and you're just running paperwork through them that's okay it's your cranes your work cruising knock yourself out as long as we approve the signature on the paperwork but an assessment on potentially the businesses you know everybody that profits from the tourism industry you know we keep that cost you keep building every squad [Music] and we really should get our neighbors because as you see in their council meetings on 28th street from indian rocks they're not going to these areas with the commercial enterprises are they charging any use fee or tax for that sort of thing i think it's just just a bad tax because yeah tdc a portion of the tdc's money first development council's money there's a percentage of it and that's really the bed tax partner goes to that environment goes to some infrastructure projects like in the past they have a council yeah it's part of the cost share they they pay the state gives us a portion corps of engineers gives us a portion and you know what the overall just average cost of renourishment is it's i couldn't tell you what cars would cause but it's well i mean it's obviously it's millions but what what are we you know what are we getting from the fed for the for the project i can find that out for you well the reason why i'm asking is because doesn't the county have a huge reserve right now don't they have this just crazy reserve and we're trying to figure out how to get money for our beaches and the state subsidizes it also yeah so just some things to throw out there i'll find out what well i think if the county uh if the county was involved they would they would demand it anyway they would demand it to be open yeah but i get back to all of the parking does not need to be given to the residents of largo and i from the beach you see we tried at one time to say city oh we got hundreds of places here but there's within a you've got to be within a quarter mile of this it's kind of like the marinas and another one that's why we had to put in the bicycle racks and that's a federal rule right yeah it's federal yeah okay and and that's why they're asking for these easements is so that they can control more and more of that well you can still park the boarding park with ballard beach so that's been my position is keep increasing the price until we get it coming we we raised it recently and uh even put a a time limit on it it's not it's still not it's not that much but it's uh it's comparable to all-day parking if you come back and keep feeding the meter every time it's shorter yeah pretty soon you're parking in the water and ours is the highest per hour right i think we could get more money i mean if it's that big of a budget number we think can you make it an hour come off the 19th and take one step to the right you have vanilla beaches [Music] i think it was sunday maybe saturday a week ago monday morning i said code enforcement he gave him the notice that he normally gave people five days a week mr surett is in march oh yeah david.gas and we forwarded that to you last week okay and then over the weekend he sent an email to everybody just this past weekend he's claiming it's been going on for a month well why didn't you say something before that he said something about it a week ago saturday or sunday yeah and i i responded to him and i called him on the phone and told him that we would take care of it we sent code enforcement out and as a saturday it was strong so we'll keep monitoring it i did catch a short-term rental friday afternoon uh at this end of town on third street and we're gonna take them and go well you're uh bringing that up i had a brief meeting with the fire chief today and that was one of the things that i brought up is there is something that we can add to these known short-term rental homes that may make it inconvenient for the the owner of the property to they're going to set up shop in bellaire beach obviously we have a fine system but with what bellerin beach is charging right now for short-term rentals just continuously doing it this is one of the things i wanted to know is is there something we can tack on a requirement that we could put into our code where if you're caught doing this well then maybe you have to you know you have to amp up the protection you don't want to mess with that short-term rental thing no no it's not a short-term rental code i'm just saying if you're a business oh you see what i'm saying so it's just i'm asking questions i just wanted to see if there's anything that we can do to make it sort of difficult i think by doing that we're acknowledging that they're short-term right and they have a different requirement than you do next door because you're so i think you need to be really careful about doing that maybe we look at increasing our fines if you're caught shortly oh we're at the max for the third five thousand is as big as we can the most we can do because of our size and you're saying the amount of money they're making on the short term term rental is so big the first offense is not that much 1500 actually yeah so matches out of five well we're not the ones that the magistrate's the one that does that we don't assess the fine but if you'll remember it's probably been a couple years ago i i did research and raised it to the maximum because i found out that i guess in miami beach you can get 20 000 and they're doing it so well i talked to uh i mean i talked to lynn at the end of our sports session because a couple neighbors complained about a house and he i think you're saying now you have to register all your people on your lease okay they registered like three families but after that 94 to 13 rounds one family unit occupies well that's what our code calls so can we before that lease comes in can we restrict it to just one family because this has an incident after pittsburgh pennsylvania 200 people one one dwelling okay it was a shooting on a vrbo so what i'm saying is some of these people just don't give a hand well and i think the problem with with doing that is that you're again we're looking at short-term rentals and applying something that you wouldn't apply to yourself so you want to have your cousins and their family come down and stay with you well now that's two families in your home that's fine but what i'm saying is what they were doing was this family would be in it for a certain amount of time and another family i guarantee you that's happening here right now so what i'm saying is that one family's vacated so instead of renting it for 90 days of family i'll take it for three weeks you take it for three weeks you take your ticket and all these names are now on the lease so and that's happening in your neighborhood in fact yeah we do have and we did put those provisions when we did the code review what is a family uni i remember talking about that what is a family unit and how do we decipher that and so we tried our best to and you're right if you're listing three families as a renter that doesn't work now if you own the house you can have whoever you want you know you don't you're not registering as a rental so yeah right that's all right and we went around with the one you're talking about and you know he paid what forty five hundred dollars in fines i actually think he was i think the owner actually was there this weekend very close relationship now yeah from hours on the phone from minnesota monitor they do all the research and connect the gods about 12 or 15 000 series you split yeah i looked into it one last thing for lloyd when you were with uh did you deal with grants we had a um we actually used to do it kind of independently within the departments and then the district hired a grants coordinator new position had to get it approved interestingly enough it was the niece of one of our board members so everybody thought wow that was kind of tricky but she did a great job so she was 100 focused on grants and sometimes that's what it takes and she bought it and brought him far more money than her salary was so it was a clear good thing to do at some point my thinking is we want to have a skull session with you about what are some of the ninja secrets for writing or crafting a grant to get past some of the issues for demographics or whatever i kind of think you can build a grant that might get us out of that hey when you're in better beach you don't deserve this and that's usually what it is because they're all they're all geared towards low-income housing and building the economy but i think it's worth a try i think we should try to sit down and try to craft a couple of these things again it grants our focus statement you can't just wait for it necessarily out there actively seeking these things saying okay what can i qualify for what can we put a spin on in our demographics that hey you know our average age you know the number of elderly or something like that there are different spins you've seen that you talk about you know well swift mud's got cooperative funding you know what i'm talking about but we went in to try to qualify for that and they you know some of the cooperative funding group came out spent a day with us we didn't meet it we wouldn't they actually told us i wouldn't waste my time because you wouldn't get any money from us and it's mainly because their spin on it was we're not a regional system and then when you talk about others it's cost-benefit ratio and if you don't make the one-to-one you're kind of stuck in the middle and you know 7th street i think we were 0.5 to 1. you know and the cost-benefit ratio well you you're going nowhere we put it in but we didn't get anywhere in in the past we've had this conversation seems like comes up every couple of years or something like that or maybe after every election but i think the three things we were looking at one was hiring somebody and trying to justify that is there a return on investment of having a full-time person the other one was looking for a company so that's what they do they just all they do is look for look for uh grants and try to figure it out and then the the third is uh rely on who we have now and occasionally we get lucky and occasionally most of the time we don't because we don't we don't qualify but the question i've always had is do we know where to look that's the problem is where do you where do you find grants for poor old bel air beach because everybody else thinks that we're not worthy of these grants part of the problem too is we don't know what we all know that's right and that's where i think we need to sit down and get focused we need professional help yeah the same reason we didn't yeah to have the whole park completely redone but at the end of the day would we have ever spent that much money in the first place and that was where that's unfortunately kyle worked on it and it didn't go through because it was too much money yeah so does anybody have anything else i think uh i think are there any action items for all these little miscellaneous things we talked about and should we put that on the board so they don't just get buried like just reviews you know to the beach parking your stuff you know we talked about all the you know city manager stuff but do we need to put some of these things down well the nourishment um you know what uh i don't really i'm more i'm more concerned i don't care about you you're concerned with parking well that's uh that's a legal issue i believe we'll have to get a hold of the london eye corps i'm getting a hold of there's an actual agreement if not we'll then have to meet with people from the camp yeah i mean what's the consequence of why they agree they're gonna right i mean that's why i'd rather talk to the county first yeah and then we can come back and we could say they told us about to pound sand and then you guys could say well we're going to do it you're not going to ask the question forgiveness you provide the same okay just so it's official who's contacting the county i will okay john bishop all right and then everything keeps coming back to you but the we were talking about the boats and you're going to contact somebody about that i've already talked to the sheriff about getting me pictures and registration so we can find out who the owners are and what i'm suggesting initially is we just sent them a letter of maybe outlining what our quote says and we'll see if we can't get rid of them to start with uh and i'm calling all the mayors up and down the beach just to see what what they're doing or if any of us are out we can send you for what if any of us are out we can just send you another close photo with the numbers on them yeah i asked the sheriff to get to start right here uh because if you go down most of the time there's not a bunch they may come for a short period and they're gone they're mostly right here yeah there were no action items on the short-term rentals right no i just gave you that we got another one friday night i made the first contact with him and i had to share stephanie it was on duty go and set up a report and we've already set up a notice violation and and i'm also supposed to contact the saint pete sector commander yeah all right anything else consideration um oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we all have that action submitted thank you arnold is the 29th our deadline is the 29th and glenn's going to send every everybody his updated version before the internet by this all friday yeah well it's 8 15. anything else everybody good all right well i appreciate it everyone spending time with us and we will see you at the next meeting we didn't have a motion to start okay and that's that's the purpose of asking for uh for all of these uh wish list items so that we can kind of come up with some some sort of a strategy on what we're going to discuss it's it's really we've got things that we're working on already and there's not so much to discuss but myself these are just the the initial meetings just to get um to get us on track because well yeah i understand plus with his yeah well i i plan on taking a vacation starting wednesday for uh until sunday so um yeah so typically the schedule is first and third yeah the first so it would be the first monday and the third day would be the commitment be nice to get along the same weeks i mean some councils even have a recession [Music] i'm not object to that at all we can always change it um maybe the monday before the first monday so you have a work session at the end of the month and then you have the meeting at the beginning of the month well that's true so a week is uh well actually let's see if we met on monday uh could we get things on is that pushing yeah because you need the adequate notification of the agenda right so these two weeks these two mondays well does it have to be on a monday okay we'll discuss that maybe a week before that monday yeah something like that so there was a wedding here was it saturday or sunday saturday i went by and picked out something out of my mailbox i wish i hadn't had a camera tv camera it was a throwdown between the families i mean there were it was all the men that were fighting i mean had her fifth strong back i don't know the mothers somebody was like this wedding's not happening did you at least know 9-1-1 oh no i thought it was great it was crazy they didn't do any damage no damage okay [Music] make sure"
