about to give in these proceedings is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth yes I [Applause] do I'm going to read the procedure we're going to follow tonight the rules that we will review when it's your turn I will actually read the variant's request at which point I will ask city manager to go ahead and make a staff report then we'll ask you as the applicant or the applicant's representative to come to the podium make a statement take as long as you'd like and then we're going to open the the uh case up for open discussion amongst the board members and amongst anybody in the audience that would like to additionally come to the podium at that point part of our Rule and procedure is a list of criteria we have six different criteria that the board will review and vote on one at a time and that the applicant must receive an um a positive response to each of these six in order for variance to be approved that point we'll have a motion and a second on the application request and then roll call vote so at this time I'd like to start with the first variance Kyle do you think um the applicant is going to come in not on Zoom right now we'll check after I get done I mean we can flip-flop we can go to the next one if you want no he he was aware he was first so let's just go with it okay is there anybody else that would be here representing Dr and Amy sha who will be talking tonight okay not yet I'm just glad you have we have a representative okay we we'll go ahead with it then this is variance request number 23-13 at 2234 5 Tado drive for Dr and Amy Scher requesting a variance from division 2 swimming pool section number 10- 174 in a nutshell because we have uh requirements saying that the pool cannot be built higher than 18 in higher than the crown of the road the applicant is requesting the construction of a pool 16.92% hello good evening could you give us your name and and um little bit about the case yep absolutely my name is John Von steenberg I'm just here representing Vic and Amy scha um the contractor for the customers here um as a lot of these properties are being built higher and higher above the crown of the road uh it's becoming increasingly more difficult to try to get our pool deck elevations down within 18 in of the crown of the road um in this particular case the back Leni the rear Leni is 7.9 ft above the crown of the road so we've taken the steps as far down to the existing grve as possible um and that is you know the ideal place for the for the pool in the pool deck um you know it's it's getting tricky you know the the flip side of this is you put in a separate retaining wall to hold back the grade from you know the center of the property or near the house the issue is still the same we still wind up with retaining walls bringing you down to the actual elevation of the pool deck um so that that's basically the issue you're you're saying that you had a difficulty getting it down to that elevation we got it down to the lowest point that we could to existing grade um so basically the elevation at the back of the rear of the house um at at the existing grade was do yeah the finished floor of the height is 7.18 Ft 7.81 ft above the crown of the road and we brought the steps down as low as we could uh basically which put us at existing grade which was 34.92 in above the crown of the road and that is where we were asking for the the variance request did you know at the time that you applied for your application and your permit at Belair Beach that this law existed uh no at the time that I I dealt with it maybe about 10 years ago on a job in belir beach on an uh interior lot but the sea the seaw wall itself on this particular lot is at nearly the same elevation as the crown of the road so the seaw walls keep coming up um so no to to answer your question I didn't know it applied to this particular property because this is something that the city watches very carefully especially the last three years including some members of this board who had had to apply for variances because of this law yes we've had multiple uh cases on a regular basis for this particular uh requirement the city council is going to review it in 2024 but at the time you went ahead and built the pool and now this is an after the fact variance is what you're saying this is not preconstruction this is post construction correct okay anybody on the board any questions did did you uh did you apply for the permit I did okay and uh I did all the permitting for it um there was the the plans that I was working on for the you know from from the Builder the plans I was working off um there was some things on there that maybe weren't as clear to me as they should have been and uh could I have gotten the pool down maybe another 6 in ing grade possibly um but it it at at the time basic going off those plans I got it as low as I could on those particular plans permit request recollect where the pool is going to end up we were 7 in off basically I think on our about on our permit request and uh the inspector when he went out to catch he caught it on the final inspection which you know we brought to our attention then and that's when we made the variant application your application got through the city correct um we have permission from both ad jent neighbors uh you know stating that you know it doesn't adversely impact their drainage um you know I I work in 35 municipalities this is the only one that has this rule on the books most of them are going towards the FEMA requirements which are 12 in above adjacent grade at any point and that's kind of the direction it seems like most of the beach municipalities are going towards which is reasonable I think from both the buding neighbors yes they both included in the variant application we're a unique Community we have tough laws especially on pools yeah it's not a coincidence we're very careful about the safety for our residents we don't let you use angle of repose the pool contractors try to use all the time to get closer than 5T this city says no it's written in our codes we don't don't allow yes I understand I had that uh I had applied for an angle propose on this as well and it was denied so we made an adjustment to the pool that's right it's Welcome to our city we're glad you're building a pool now please abide by our laws you're hereit night because of a variance that was post construction because you basically got caught it was um unintentional and and that's why you're here yep that's why I'm here anybody else on the board Mar anybody Mark is there anybody in the audience that would like to speak go go ahead I'm sorry we didn't do a staff report but you can the applicant for the record the per the permit when it came through and got approved it was within the 18 in above the crown of the road okay so it did not slip past the city I don't have it in front of me right now but I just and I can verify that there was a mistake made on my on my end uh basically looking at plans I had two different surveys for the property showing two different crowns of the road and uh so it you know it was a mistake on on my end uh but one that you know I'm here to you know try to get corrected tonight so you did say that you have neighbors on both sides that we've received letters from that do not object correct KY there's no issues storm water runoff etc etc no sir okay go ahead David you were asking saying in 20 24 city council is going to address this since I've been on the board here um probably 90% of our variance requests are related to this pool in Crown right are we not going to have this in the future hopefully because it's it's a common I speak that we have the code review project starting in January so we uh we just P back the contract to start with a planner to go through all the building code that's on the list it is on the list yeah and that'll be done sooner rather than later because it's going to become less restrictive so we're not B by the uh Senate bill till wait till October 2024 that's good news all right thank you any other questions any other comments from the board so I I I have a question because I'm trying to now think Mark you want to slide up to theic closer thank you there we go thank you um was this house demo rebuilt ground up yes really I don't think I don't think there the street for you sorry but it was a new new construction build yeah um yeah I would say for the record you know we can address this on a lot of existing structures demo ground up buil you know if they're going to put a PO and we should try to alleviate the uh the Delta for the for the height criteria if they're building new it's a little bit easier it's almost impossible to fix on an existing structure you can't it's it's the structure is there but on a demo rebuild can kind of make the numbers work that's that's a very important statement you know the horse is out of the bar house build and and everything looks beautiful it's a really nice I don't have any issues with it but on a on a new build it's different situation that that's a very very big issue right now b beach has always had the attitude and I'll move closer that if you're building new you can comply with our laws you can comply with our setbacks you can comply with our elevations there shouldn't really be a need for any variance if you are doing a new bill just like the statement you made you're a contractor you're a developer you understand that um in Tony's case he had to he took an existing home and we had to deal with the the elevations that he had um you are here on a new build and um you know we'll we'll adjudicate this to the best of way that we can um the the helpful part is that your neighbors agree with with this and you don't have any water running off into their backyard so so IAD just to tie a bell on that I I think Kyle as as we look at establishing some new criteria for building code in this specific situation I think there should really be two buckets existing structures versus new build because when you're building new you can fix grades and if someone's going to put a pool in and it's put in let's say a year or two after a new bill you might want to put stipulations or conditions in the building permit that say if you're going to put a build a pool in the pool's going to need to meet code so they should take into consideration up front where that elevation of the finished board goes in order to satisfy whatever the code ends up being okay yeah [Music] not the pools built and completed correct correct and uh to be clear I I have no involvement in the home building I was brought in after the home was already uh you know basically under roof and um and that's when you know when we were brought in um but it is becoming increasingly more difficult as FEMA requiring these houses to have finished floor Heights at 10 ft um so you're you have a a house that's 10 ft above sea level usually somewhere around 7t above the top of a uh retaining you know of the seaw wall so it's something where it's it's become becoming more more difficult to to try to find that uh common ground on some of these new Builds on some of the older builds it's actually uh easier sometimes because the finished floor height is below 10 ft so it is definitely just a tricky situation and a unique to you know to b beach Kyle are we ready thank you all this time we're going to go ahead and move on to our six criteria questions that each applicant must receive approval on and I will ask Vice chairman Jane Goldman if she'll go ahead and reach each of these questions after which our clerk will call the rule Miss Goldman okay number one um you demonstrated the special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Renee if you go ahead and call the rooll Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yes Mr alen yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gatlin yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes that's six yeses and one no thank you okay so number two have you demonstrated that the variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land building or structure yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yes Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes again that's six yeses and one no thank you number three have they demonstrated that granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella no Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes five yes and two no number four demonstrated that the variance requested does not change the use of the property from the use characteristics mandated for district 1 and 2 in sections 30 through 51 and 94 to-252 in article 4 division three of this chapter yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Bean yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes number five will fully comply fully with additional conditions and safeguards which the board of adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for which a variance is required shall commence and are be completed yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Elia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes and Mr Kelly yes seven yeses okay number six de have they demonstrated that the variance requested does not violate any provision and requirement set forth in chapter 62 and chapter 74 of the city code yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella no Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes five yeses and two knows would anyone like to go ahead and make a motion regarding this variance request 23-13 I'll make a motion variance request number 23-15 thank you Mr Mar is there a second second thank you Tony I think he said variance 2315 is it 2313 133 oh wantate okay Mr Marana would you like to go ahead and make make that motion on variance request 2313 I move that we approve variance request 2313 thank you sir our second was second Tony thank you Tony um Rene if you go ahead and call R Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes and Mr Kelly yes sir your variance is approved thank you thank you for coming this evening please tell your applicant um that um the city is is glad he's here new construction but in the fure future you with more pools to be built in b beach you'll know that law and come to our city with the approval of no more than 18 in or come back and see us for a variance thank you you're welcome okay that concludes 23-13 our next variance request is 23-14 at 5:30 Bell Isle Drive Christen whitfill is requesting a variance for the number one for the same thing that we just voted on where the uh construction of a pool is to be built more than 18 in higher than the road by what the request is 2.4 in above the maximum height Allowed by city code Kyle if you can go ahead and make a staff report regarding this case so yeah so the first variance is for the elevation code about being 18 in above the crown of the road in this case the crownal road elevation of 5.1 ft and the proposed pool back elevation is 6.8 ft so when you wrak that down in inches as the engineer did in the report um that is asking for variance of 2.4 in above the uh maximum of 18 in above the crown of the road there's a second do we want to talk about the second variance sure go ahead there's a second variance um request in that is on um division two so we pull section 10- 174 I3 and that states that swimming pools may be located closer to 12 ft from the seaw wall so long as the minimum setback of 8 ft is maintained from the center of the seawall C cap to the inside of the pool wall and provided that prior to the issuance of a construction permit a sign and sealed certification from a Florida registered engineer is submitted with the permit application showing that the reduced set back will not affect Integrity or function of the seaw wall or that the approved seaw wall reinforcement if needed will be installed and complete in a minimum of 30 days prior to the time of the S pool construction so um in this the plan for this pool the uh they're asking uh with an engineer letter uh certifying the plan they're asking that the pool is 5.5 ft away from the center of the seaw wall cap so the minimum per code says that it um it can be up to 8 ft from the center of the seawall cap if the engineer gives that certification um in this case uh the property owner is asking that they can go closer than the ft to 5.5 ft so they're asking for a variance of 2.5 ft U closer to the to the actual um into the minimum set back which would be 8 ft thank you before the applicant comes forward so the code is 12 ft from the seaw wall for the edge of the be right up to the the deck could be right up to the cap but the shell of the pool can't be 12 ft closer so measure from the inside wall the pool um regularly it can be 12 ft from the center of the sea cap and then if you have an engineer certified you can get closer up to 8 ft from the center of the seawall C and I noticed the engineers reporting there he's fine with with the new seaw wall being built tiebacks being installed according to the plan that he's fine with the Integrity of the seaw wall there is a letter included in the application that St that and the Neighbors on either side are ins supported um there are two neighbors that are okay with the proposed plan I think that's a neighbor to the South and a neighbor to the north yes this is a new build right this is a house that's under construction yes that this is a demo Rebuilder sorry I I believe this is a demo reu okay but right now during the course of this variance request the house is under construction or is it finished it's under construction okay hey Kyle I have a question so with the engineering certificate then he's allowed to go 8 ft to the seat wall but he's requesting to go 5 and2 ft to the seat wall correct correct all right for the engineer certificate to say he can go 8 ft yeah is based on the current seaw wall right where this is now based on the new plans with the new setback or the new the new tiebacks is why he's saying 5 and A2 is fine so yes it's uh the engineer letter um which is following the plans uh says a replacement seaw wall plan with a span beam cap and anchoring system has been designed to accommodate the proposed pool is attached for review and then it says the attached proposed pool plan shows a pool being constructed within 5 ft of the seaw cap and 10 ft from the north line of the property um and I believe in that the our engineer review is where he determined it see in Ruben Carlson's letter he said if the replacement seaw wall system and you pool is constructed for the attached lands um well if you look at the ex plans the tiebacks on either side of the proposed pole they got five or six tie rods coming in where the other ones only have two so it looks like they are reinforcing the tiebacks right on either side of the pool shell to compensate for the closeness of of the pool is that right it looks like that but it would be important for this for as he said if this the new sew wall system you p is constructed for the attached PL so um I guess my only concern with how do we keep make sure that that whoever builds a seaw wall that they do build it by those plans and don't make any adjustments on the fly as some Sewall Builders do I mean is that something we can kind of keep track of that's the responsibility of the the building department with County yeah I want to give the board a little bit of history about our seaw wall setback for years and years and years biller Beach is always had a 12T setback up and down the waterfronts you have seaw Wall contractors that have put the anchors nickname dead men 12 ft away I mean this goes back into the 60s basically a lot of the seaw walls were built during the 60s this board started getting in the 80s more and more requests for variances to get closer than the 12 ft Bellis County in approximately 19881 who was also their Board of adjustment was also being bombarded by bigger pools and closer to this request for closer to the seaw walls went ahead and decided that with a seaw wall Engineers authorization and a system that was acceptable within the um the protocol of of the Marine engineer that they would go to a maximum excuse me a Minimum distance from the seaw wall of 8 ft with engineering because they said we don't want any more Varian this is pel's Count saying we don't want any more of these variances I can't tell you how many as a pool contract that I took before the county and they finally said this is crazy we're getting too many pools at every single one of our various meetings they went to 8 feet with the full intent that there would be no more variance request for pools period but two years later we after being in bombarded in in our little town for pools most of at 12 feet we went to 8 ft County city council chose to go to 8T and no more variances on pools we this group has been bombarded in the past two years with the same law with another with pool pool pool on another law which our council's going to look at but the intent back in that 8284 period when our Council was we don't want any more pool Varian it's 8 ft that's it Welcome to our city live with it but that was based on preserving the Integrity of the seaw wall precisely so if they get an engineer report here that says seaw wall Integrity is not compromised by this plan we kind of look that's an answer to our concern that would be an answer to our concern ananal to concern but our setbacks are are Premier with us you know are 25 ft in the front or 25 ft in the rear those are set in stone for the structures right are are 5T off the house as I mentioned at the previous pool contractor we don't allow you to get any closer than 5 so we've got 5et off off the building and 8 ft in the rear with engineering without having to come before this port I haven't asked the applicant up yet I intend to but that is the nature of why we have an 8 foot rear setback C any further information all any more questions from board members of C go ahead Mark as far as safety the insurance company or the city for allowing us where do we stand on that one I mean would yeah words okay we we grab the variance to go 2 and 1/2 foot or 3 foot closer where does that leave the city stand or our board stand when you first time through the changes but Consulting an outside engineer another engineer or at least to get get some kind of uh an idea where everybody else what everybody else is doing talking the insurance rating for the city right it could affect insurance rate sure well I mean it's a it's a valid question do we take liability and approving variants like this if the seaw wall collapses I wouldn't think so but we have sign we have a sign document from from the engineer right so is he accepting liability what you're saying well he is accepting liability do we accept he is definitely accepting liability do we accept it with him by agreeing with I would think we would K what do you think you'd have to go to Randy for an answer I would you'd have to look at case law Marv saying are we hanging ourselves out to drwing I think I think we'd leave us leave the city would be wide open for okay good job good question any other questions for Kyle before we we ask the applicant to come forward if not would um Miss Whitfield or representative at 5:30 bellal please come to the podium please introduce yourself sir good evening my name is Mike mne I'm uh repr iing Freestyle Pools the pool building okay go ahead sir and and give us some information so the the first Varian request we're asking for is about 2 and2 in higher than the 18 in uh above the crown of the road um currently that's roughly what the grade is at the house now that's 6.75 that's already what grade is so if we were to we'd have to actually lower the grade to get the deck in and remain at that 18 in it would also add an additional St coming off the new construction house that we're trying to eliminate as well so we're right at 7 and 12 in risers with five steps six risers coming down and that gets us at about 2 and half inches higher than the Crown uh 18 in above the crown of the one of the things that we ask and that's crucial to us is this the minimum variance request you're saying 2.4 in is the best you can do without having to comply with our with our code correct that's already what is right there if you look at the site plan on the on the building plan grade's already at about 6.7 on the back of the house so your slab is 10.6 and you want to drop it down to 6.7 6.8 basically the top of your coping the slab of the house is actually higher than that and yes roughly at the edge of the patio which is already a step down um with pitches about 10.6 is that patio built is the patio wi nothing the go ahead I just had a question keep going that's okay that's that's that's basically it we're asking for the 2 and half inches for the height to eliminate adding another step or lowering grade in the back even further if you had to add another step 2.4 in is basically a toast Stone correct so you'd probably go 4 in or 6 in or whatever correct in which case you would be in compliance with our code correct okay which we'd have to lower the grade that's already existing in the back even even further the yard's already at that elevation in the back but in the rear you're probably going to do something to get closer to that 5.3 seaw w grade so I'm sure the step Downs of some sort there will be on retaining wall correct there will be a retaining wall on the back okay does everybody on the board understand what what's going on here I mean we're close 2.4 in is doable this it's this okay yeah it's less than that yeah um is there anybody else would like to speak ma'am would you like to speak you're welcome to not for this one okay in that case we're going to go ahead and go through our criteria questions Miss Vice chairman yes me again never one have we have you demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District yes variance approved no variant tonight Mr Beam this is going to be on 2314 correct yes uh Mr Mariano yes Mr alas yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes number two of um have you demonstrated that the variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land building or structure yes variance approved no variance denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes yes seven yes third question have you demonstrated that granting the variance will not confir on this applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatli yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes okay number four demonstrated that the variance requested does not change the use of the property from the use characteristics mandated for districts 1 and two in sections 30- 51 94-25 two and Article 4 division three of this chapter yes variance approved no variance denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes okay number five the applicant will comply fully with additional conditions and safeguards which the board of adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for which a variance is required shall commence in or be completed yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes okay six um has the applicant demonstrated that the variance requested does not violate any provision and requirements set forth in chapter 62 and chapter 74 of the city code yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes uh Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes and Mr Kelly yes seven yes would any member of the board like to make a recommendation or a motion on case number 23-14 motion to approve is there a second thank you Mr Bean second thank you Mr Marano um if you'll call the RO Rene Mr Beam yes yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Alia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes your variance to to construct a pool 2.4 in above the maximum height 18 in Allowed by city code is approved don't go away with do another one okay second variance that we have for this particular residence is to got it on this one thanks is to construct a pool that encroaches 2.5 ft into the minimum setback Allowed by city code that minimum setback that we're talking about is Kyle explained is 8 ft of the seaw wall that um um well you want to be 5.5 ft from the seaw wall not 8 ft Off the seaw Wall um again got some basic questions for you we're always concerned about a hardship this pool hasn't been built yet right you know we know you're dealing with simple math you've got 25 ft in the rear to deal with You' Got 5 ft off the house and 8 ft Off the seaw Wall gives you a 12T right wide pool right correct there's four or five members of this board that have pools that are on Waterfront that are no more than 12T wide and they're safe pools but this request is for what reason why do you want a water pool just to utilize more of the pool to to create a pool larger than 12 ft to have a larger safe swimming area any comments any questions was there any consideration to narrow the pool at all from it's 15t 7 in there any that'll be is there any leeway was there yes if you say if you guys do not allow the 5 and 1/2 ft I'm sure they will welcome whatever he will allow I mean the fact that we have and I'm being in the real estate industry for my whole career r clar is the guru of seaw wall Construction in the industry everybody gets their opinions from rot clarson engineering very well respected and uh I mean the seaw wall has been replaced on this property if I'm not mistaken already is there a new wall going in yes sir well there's a new wall going in but I think even the existing wall before the house was torn down is not the original Seawall I do not know the history of the it's not a cement SE wall it's a corrugated wall so I think the Wall's already been replaced probably doesn't need to be replaced again other than for the fact that it's cool and the fact that the applicant is willing to take that step to put a new wall in engineered properly for this consideration I don't see an issue with it in my mind I'm going to read one more thing that we have because buzzword as we know regarding variances are there special conditions or unique circumstances they exist on this that'll be a question that we'll answer pretty quickly but one of the conditions in the application that we read that the applicant reads and turns in talks about special conditions or unique circumstances will not result from the I'm going to highlight these words the intentional Act of the applicant or the applicant agent this Pool isn't built does it have a hardship I'm not sure about that one but they have to demonstrate that the the special condition or unique circumstance exist um to go with a larger pool in my mind rather than what the code will accept is an intentional act on the part of the applicant opinion only we'll vote on this but that is what we must abide abide by the beginning of the sentence that I didn't start says a variance granted by the board of adjustment shall be consistent with the public interest when owing to a special condition and the little enforcement of the provisions of this chapter they will not result in an unnecessary and undue hardship to the applic that's a little lofty as to what we're talking about but when this board votes you'll understand any questions again does anybody else in the audience want to talk before we vote okay okay Madam Vice chair we're going we're talking about variance request 23-15 this is this basically the setback the first question is has the applicant demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved which are not applicable to other similar structures or buildings in the same zoning District yes the Varian is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam no Mr Mariano no Mr Elia no Mr Gardella no Mr gatliff no Miss Goldman no Mr Kelly no seven NOS number two has the applicant demonstrated that the variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land Building build or structure yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yeah I'm sorry no Mr Elia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman no Mr Kelly no number three oh I'm sorry five Nos and two yeses what was our first one seven seven okay thanks mhm okay has the applicant demonstrated that granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam no Mr Mariano no Mr Elia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman no and Mr Kelly uh five Nos and two yeses number four as the applicant demonstrated that the variance requested does not change the use of the property from the use characteristics mandated for districts 1 and two in sections 30- 51 and 94-25 and Article 4 division three of this chapter yes the variance is approved no the variance is denied Mr Beam no Mr Mariano yes Mr ellot no Mr Gardella yes Mr Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman yes and Mr Kelly yes okay got two no and five yes okay number five we're almost done applicant will comply fully with additional conditions and safeguards which the board of adjustment May prescribe including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for which a variance is required shall commence and orb completed yes variance approved no variance denied Mr Beam yes Mr Mariano yes Mr Ilia yes Mr Gardella yes Mr Gat yes Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes seven yes number six has the applicant demonstrated that the variance requested does not violate any provision and requirements set forth in chapter 62 in Chapter 7 of the city code Mike we have a refresher on 62 and 74 um Kyle 6 which one storm water management 62 is uh utilities and 74 is storm water storm water thank you Mark um go ahead Mr Beam no Mr Mariano no Mr Alia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes m Goldman no Mr Kelly no that's five no and two yes okay um in that the applicant must get all six criteria in the affirmative for a variance to be approved and we had 1 two three four five of the six is that right Renee that were denied yes I will entertain a motion for 20-5 23-15 uh at this time I'll make a motion to approve 2315 second this is for approval correct even though we got five of the six questions Deni C it takes one for denial so do we not have an option to make a motion to approve you can you can be voed up or down I'm make a motion to approve the variance request for 23:15 this is for approval um I I'll stop there go ahead who who was the second on that I have a thank you for the record I got um four of the questions were NOS four Nos and two yes yeses okay and for the record when the first one was denied as chair I could have terminated this criteria questions I have in respect to the applicant um we want to go through all six of these go ahead Mr Beam no Mr Mariano no Mr ellia no Mr Gardella yes Mr gatliff yes Miss Goldman no and Mr Kelly no so five no and two yes your variance is denied sir I appreciate you coming up and explaining everything on behalf of your applicant um I'm glad we were able to accommodate your elevation situation um but as far as the pool that you Tim between you and your applicant but thank you for at least coming before board tonight thank you very much for your time okay we will move on to variance number guess that's 23 to 16 236 yeah okay consideration of the variance 2316 at 614 B Edward Murphy isqu requesting a variance from chapter 94 for zoning section 79422 regarding minimum living area and setbacks the variance is to allow an encroachment of 3 feet into the minimum setback Allowed by city code Kyle the floor is yours thank you thank you chairman so the first variance is requesting um to encroach the minimum rear setback of the B lot which um the setback in the code says it has to be 25 ft um the proposed plans is to extend an existing balcony that goes 3 feet into the rear setback this is an existing structure obviously yeah is that correct yeah if you go through your your packet you'll see that there's a picture that in the house see that there is B vle off is would it be easy for you to put up like a Google map of the property so we can see it on that billboard [Applause] behind thank you Kyle what Kyle's doing every R do you know if we receiv received and I didn't notice in the B any letters um for or against this variance not to my knowledge okay anybody find any letters of the package not for this one okay 614 right in the center okay that's so again he included the whole plan document that shows the demolition of the existing balcony um and then building it back where it will um encroach the 25t set back by 3 ft is the upper balcony also being extended along with the lower patio what's well it's the the patio ex this the upper balcony and the pillars will be moved further towards the seaw wall so then the upper balcony of the the pitcher here would also be that's going to be extended 3 ft and then the lower covered Bel patio is now going to be covered by an additional 3 ft okay basically the whole structure is going out 3T in 22 ft for the set or the seaw okay thanks and this is for to accommodate a wheelchair or just to make it a compliant with the American that that's what the application says but all that that property what is the width of the balcony now 8T um that thank any other questions of Kyle board members if not I'll ask the applicant or his representative to please come to the introduce yourself and tell us something about it what do you good evening my name is Ed Murphy and I'm here with my architect so if you have any uh technical questions you can probably better answer uh I I think it's uh pretty simple what I'm looking for hopefully um my sister was former uh law enforcement she was injured she's disabled requires a wheelchair um she the wheelchair will not make it out on the existing B balcony while it's about 6 ft the inside is only about 4 ft and there's a drop down so I was looking to extend the balcony by another 3 ft to allow first of all a ramp so she can come out and go down but then also have the room to go through the balcony in the other direction uh um I spoke with both my neighbors actually they sent me emails but uh this was a while ago so they've not been updated but they both said that they're okay with it is that what Mr Davis is that one of them yeah Rudy and uh uh don Morano who's on on the other side okay um I thought Rudy might be here tonight as a neighor um if you look at uh on either the Google or so on you can see that it comes out to a point and it's Cur so it will in no way imped or block uh either of my neighbors or any of my neighbors um view which I I think maybe the main intent of having uh this setback um and if you can see um I guess on the bottom of the house there's a big Hedges uh yeah right there um that you can't see through uh anyway um and on the other side there's about a I'm guessing about a five or six foot uh wall um so I I I think that's um that's that's pretty much it why I'm looking for um you know the uh to extend the about your assistant is able to get up on the second floor do you have an elevator in your sir yeah a lift I hope to have uh someday an elevator assistant or sister sister sister is she's a full-time president uh no not yet not yet but this is your primary residence sir it is you live there full time yes so the new deck is going to be completely even with the bottom of the sliding glass doors is that uh so there's a little drop down for uh drainage okay you know so when you come out the door drops down uh a bit so will it be about the same height of what your existing travetine patio is yes yes yeah and it's it's just the balcony itself you know the house is going to remain uh as it is so the roof line and everything comes out another 3 ft from the from the roof line all the way down um so the the existing roof line is coming out over the six ft that'll actually be cut back some because there'd be nothing to to hold it so they won't that level the the roof level will not come out over the new exist do it's going to be cut back a couple of feet away from the house Mr architect do you care to join Mr Murphy at the podium he's doing a great job thought you might want to help out yeah so uh you know with the design Mr Murphy uh asked us to go ahead and design the balcony so that his sister in Wich would be able to come through his existing flat of glass doors and as you know with the balconies here in Florida we do drop them down about 4 in to six in so with any driving rain or water we don't want puddling up against sled glass doors and coming into your house so with that distance we had to put a landing there so in a wheelchair you come out the side glass doors to a landing uh which per Ava guidelines is a 5x5 Landing 5 foot by 5 foot okay so she would come out to the landing be able to turn her wheelchair and then go down the ramp which at a 1 to 12 slope which is per adaa guidelines as with a 4 in or 6 in drop we would need at least a 6ot r uh depending if it's a 4 in drop then it would only be a 4T ramp that would be required now as soon as she's onto the balcony being able to transverse both sides we would have to have enough space from the edge of that Landing to the outside face now with that face and going through Ada requires a minimum of 36 in between the space and in this condition here with Mr Murphy uh he shared with me the wheelchair size of a sister which is a metc wheelchair which is actually a 34in wide seat and then outside of that you have wheels so it's a little bit larger than actually a 36 in width so when you're going by the railings and not having to hit or having a hard time going by by we increase that width a little bit slightly more so should be able to get through there easily uh past where those railings would be and so that is the reason why we have the balcony out that far I'm sure go ahead Tony in your design um did you just design it to where you just to the minimum that you could do it you know without going like going multiple out there so we designed it to the minimum based with um the based on the railings that were designed that was picked because the railings are actually mounted on the deck uh if the railing design changed to be a face mount then actually it would save some inches and the balcony would be able to come in so you know with those railing sizes depending on the railing uh in this conc certain condition and with the architecture style of the home the railings were all deck mounted and so that kind of added to a couple extra inches so if it had to come in a little bit slightly we could change railing design which then would bring it to a more limited aspect of instead of 3T it could probably come into about a 2 and 1/2 ft you say about six Ines there stand there kind I got a question for you we're looking look at an ISR maximum impervious surface ratio per city code of 65 65% with this variance does it go to 88% like Larry's letter said so it exists at an 88 uh r088 ratio so nothing they're doing with with the expansion of the balcony is affecting what it already is that's where I was going with that this thing since it's perious to begin with and what we've got is imperious 188 Mark okay with that yeah just the circumstance not going to take out yeah yeah no water's going to perate anywhere okay stupid question but I I wanted to ask it your your column footings have got to be enormous yes they are they're about I believe I can't remember off top of my head I think they're I mean they look like 3 or 4ot yeah they're large they're large columns going out there so we're pouring and placing those columns right in place and I leave that to my structural engineer design so I I did not Design This okay I got a question go ahead David um I understand the impervious ratio the way it is currently so you're not increasing or you know we're not asking you to decrease that but there is a fairly wide long patio there deep patio that goes along the 4 in below the GL sters M what can't that patio accommodate that the new patio is going to accommodate if it goes out 3 feet cuz I I mean I I you got a wheelchair in all due respect coming out of the glass doors you got a circle patio there that's pretty deep you know wide sideways is it just a matter of putting a ramp from that existing patio down to the lower patio I what's the purpose of break bringing everything out 3 ft to accommodate the wheelchair it's just the uh the top balcony only the um I don't see from here but uh you can see how narrow this is here so if I don't know if you can picture it but this will be coming out about 3T nothing will change with this okay uh bottom Bal it'll just be this extending about 3T and uhill that's it it's the balcony that she has travel your main living area is upstairs of the two balcon okay so you're extending the the upstairs balcony Out 3 feet columns that are exis and stay the same below the columns exist columns below are going to get removed and new columns put in place that are in line with the the new three FL St okay that's what I was asking about the size you're putting based on David's question footings are Big 3 3x3 or 4x4 um for substantial load above good Mark no questions thinking yeah I am I'm surpris you wouldn't want to can leave her over and leave the columns where they're at so we did look at that uh condition of about cany uh but it was a desire uh to get the column to outboard to be even with the B so there so that was uh the design preference design preference understand it's an awful expense so for design mam r j it's yours okay here we go as the applicant question number one for 23-16 now is this for the imperious or is this for the 3ot this is for the 3ot this is for the 3ot 3 foot okay yeah the next one is 17 y okay so this is 23-16 um has the applicant demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved

Miss Goldman yes Mr Kelly yes gentlemen thank you for coming in both variances are approved did a terrific job we wish you well with your project thank you very much the holid to is there any other information board would request any other questions any other matters to come before the board Rene we want to thank you for doing a great job we hope it weren't too hard on you we all get along we'd like to keep this thing civil and we're glad you're here well do we see her do does she get to see us next month or don't we have another variance coming up right now we have no applications until someone builds a pool question yes uh so what's going on with the city and and all the ordinances they're reviewing it starting the first of the year so we're going to have a meeting in January I'm looking to do it during a city council work session um where the uh the planner is going to come in and and um go over the project what what he's going to do in the timeline um it's going to probably span out maybe six months um just to because we're have to do some meetings with the uh Planning and Zoning Board to get their approval then goes to city council once we get the ordinance drafted the uh the ordinances uh that are making our current code more restrictive will kind of be lined up hopefully for October 1 to be uh read first and second reading okay so hopefully if everything goes right by October 1st it be all complet um no well it' be November's meeting would be the second reading would be yeah but like I said if we have less restrictive code we can read that prior we can at least get some of these out of the the kiosk you know you know if um accessory structures is part of this review or I have it on my list do yeah it's that's part of the zoning code and yeah we're going uh thoroughly through the uh construction and Zoning sections don't you think uh with all the experience this board is going through with with these pool Vari that we should as members consider coming to the work sessions to where these boards to where you're the pnz board doesn't know what's going on with these pools we had we we are more apt to help and give comment pro and con and recommendations as to where this new Crown should be where the next level above the crown of the road if they so choose where that where that level should be and finalize at that level right right Ian this this this ordinance is only been in effect since like 2016 or so and there was a war as to what this level should be there was arguments between citizens I was here at the podium being asked as a pool builder to give pros and cons the mayor at that time didn't want to hear anything but 18 in above the crown of the road the engineer and I both said it should be 30 in above the CR of the road but there should be more a much more liberal condition and Council fought it and voted it so here we are nine years later Mar go ahead uh the problem comes in it's walk around the pools you know what should be the minimum for safety right what does the insurance what the insurance companies say is a safe you know are we going to have a pool with a two foot walk around well that's where you know next to the seaw wall and then drop off 3 ft and and then you're eventually going to hit the seaw wall and end up in the ocean there's got to be some criteria there well that's part of what I was explaining to one of the pool contractors that this board of I mean the angle of repose an accepted an accepted engineering principle whether it's a a whether it's a pool adjacent to it or whether it's a a structure adjacent to it safety was the issue we don't want to let anybody get closer than 5 ft to a walk around we only allow the swim out the little 18in seat to be within that 15 5ot a that's all about safety you don't want to open the door and take two steps and fall in the water so we're protected on the house side and we're we're we're tough on that and you've heard the PO build say yeah I tried to use ankle POS but b beach doesn't allow it that's why we're concerned about the safety the flip side is what you're talking about exactly and even even to the North and South reach and west you know on either side of the house if you're full if you've got a lower for drainage you got to have it lower to drain water away from your resident so that there's a spale there not that we we have it in our in our ordinances already you can't put water in your neighbor's property that's it but then you know these people want to build a pool to the match right so they want to build it right up to the edge so what do you have about walk around the pool and then I think a couple years ago we a p we somebody requested through the insurance company looking at the property they wanted to put a glass a glass wall around so the kids or the people wouldn't fall off right for a fence but they didn't want to put a wall up because it was it would stop the view from the home so we had to put this glass full cap for glass fence that was what two three four years ago yeah so I'm a software girl and I like stats is it worth someone taking a look at how many of these we've had and what the ask was I gave the uh aggregating the data so that we can when you go to these meetings you can say well we've had 52 requests same requests over and over and over again yeah um it might help our position provided the history of our our variant approvals and what's come to the planner um so so they're going to take some public input and then they're going to review the sections that we set for them to review and based on their Professional Knowledge and what they've done in other communities in this area they're going to give their recommendations and then at that point um it'll go to a planning and zoning board meeting where they'll kind of walk through it all and that's where most of the discussion will occur um I encourage the the board of adjustment to attend some of those meetings as they go through it um and I could forward you know the agendas and the recommendations to the board so that you can call through it you can send the stats that would be helpful I to ammunition yes to to you know to provoke change you have to have that that's right okay so just real quick goad Mar before we go um Kyle did I see an application that may have been on this agenda and possibly came off for a two lot split into two into three that was last month no it was yeah it was two it was one in two that approved no you should have been [Music] here believe me I wanted to be here for that particular one last question Kyle are pool builders finally waking up this guy is a pool build is only waking up to our 18 inch maximum above the crown of the road requirement on new construction coming into the city well like like that pool builder said you know there with it's new construction they're still asking for higher than the 18 and a lot of it is because they're building up you know female wants everybody to raise their first floor living area so they're looking at starting from higher and coming all the way down right so more steps so the the gentleman that spoke tonight um did he indicate that he wasn't the that he came on after the fact to that project is that that's what he said that's what he indicated right so is it who is it g Coast pool who who built that pool do we know the first move was [Music] tropical freestyle is the one proposing I think we should tell them not to wear hats yeah right I think it's rude Yeah well yeah I mean I think you know historically I know pool builders in general the same general m in general you know regardless of what the house the current house looked like they miraculously were all at 18 in um you know when they built their pools because we know that in the past no one was checking up on that you know no one was going out there and you know from the city and verifying those numbers they're taking it you know on trust so that's that's something that's different now I think we're we're starting to follow up on those things or no yeah we have better technology and I I didn't tell Mike but I did purchase one of those tools good for you we got new toys yeah it's a smart tool that you know use your iPhone but it's very accurate and you you go from a set point it can tell you the elevation as you measure quickly and you can do it alone we bought one shortly after your pool because Normal in normal surveying or or um checking grades Mark you know somebody's on the on one end and somebody's holding the stick on the other end and you're trying to dial it up and you hope everything's simple but his toy that is made in Europe we bought one we showed Kyle and uh he can do it by himself yeah he can go out there and get he get stats he can get um area square footage you can get elevations we haven't tried all the things with you get three dimensional layouts yeah just on your phone you have to set it so you have the sensor it goes at the bottom of the stick and then the phone sits on top and then you walk and it it tells you where to place it and when to stop and all that and it draws pretty much a a shape of what you're measuring it's threedimensional so when he's trying to measure square footage of a of a of a driveway yeah or or walkways things that are on that ISR worksheet let make a headlight he's confirming and verify what other people have put on those worksheets that's good be a lot easier cuz this last one after Tony mentioned something that it was higher once I got the final elevation certificate I just took the livable floor and I measured all the dimensions down but it'll be a lot easier using the tool right so people can't cheat CU he's got a tool that's really really really accurate who would try and cheat um most pool is there a motion to adjourn motion to ajour standing okay"
