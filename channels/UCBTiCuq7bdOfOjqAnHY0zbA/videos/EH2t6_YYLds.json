    "transcript": "hi everyone I like to call to order the um September 21st 2023 Park and record meeting um Deb could you please call the roll Tammy I'm here Teddy Roberts here Michael Leakes here John Wagner Deborah decasimo me you had to think about that one yeah Kyle is not here Aaron I'm here Aaron's here and Susan is not here okay perfect um moving on um to item number one on the agenda may please have a motion to approve I make a motion may I have a second second all in favor hi okay so today's agenda is approved may you please have a motion to approve the August 24th 2023 park and rec board minutes I moved to approve the August 24th park and rec board minutes may I have a second second all in favor okay so the minutes from last meeting that um are approved and then agenda item number three citizen comments we have no citizens in attendance today so we're just going to go right to number four which is the inventory of the Bellaire Beach logo merchandise and I'll hand it over to Patty okay beach towel seven hand towels eight baseball caps three gray two khaki license plates five logo coffee mugs for logo stickers six sling bags one and welcome bags four okay awesome so it sounds like we're running low the hats are really going still so we'll um when Kyle gets back I will talk to him about ordering more hats and then or you can do it and then also it seems like the coffee mugs are flying so I know she gave away some but I mean there was quite a few in there after the thank you luncheon for all the board members so maybe we just you know go ahead with another round of those maybe in another you know the color was nice so I don't know why she'd mess with the color it was just white with the logo and they they literally I don't know if I use mine every week and they hold up great in the dishwasher and you know the logo doesn't fade so they're really good quality so I don't know unless you guys are you know we probably need to at our next meeting talk about like maybe one more item I think we kind of discussed like maybe kitchen towels for something for one more thing to sell at the Holiday yeah so even if we talked about ornaments yeah so something but like I think if we get that going at the the October meeting we'll have time to order it and have them in stock by no uh December or fifth or fourth whenever that party is I think it's the fourth can we do hats in that color blue I like that I do too I would buy these are the first ones so maybe we can revisit like just do the beige because I love how this is iridescent I'm loving it I can tell you they don't care that hair doesn't uh threaten me more uh or we get that's from Boston's they no longer have that yeah and the also thing is the new place where we go to get some of the embroidery through the foundation they don't have the shimmery either yeah I can check again um yeah okay I mean that's that's a nice hat I would like that better than a khaki yeah I'm in if you can do a different color so we'll um look into that and is that a girls cap versus a men's cap or they're just they're unisexy yeah okay that would fit yeah they're just adjustable and good okay John you've seen my baby blue Beller Beach hat I wear it a lot it's fabulous it's fabulous we like the kids I am looking for a couple of hats here so I'll be down there too when are you coming back and you should be back probably the following day and right this is tentatively because I'm going to have the uh I think I'm gonna have the roof replaced on this house and everything there's hail damage so I'm gonna need to go down and come back so I'm a little bit I don't know exactly how this is going to work but if I can figure this out I'm going to stay down there until after the uh Beach cleanup on the uh on the 7th to probably come back here do a little bit more fishing then come back down awesome okay so um that sounds good and then so is everybody good with the inventory for the merchandise does anybody have anything else to add I added what I wanted to say the welcome bags we do need there's only four put together yeah okay so we need to address did you add the Pilates information to did you bring it to City Hall and get it yeah I brought it to City Hall on Michael sat here and paired them all together for me oh good I just wasn't here so I didn't know yeah Michael what was it about maybe 25 of them yeah so it's a pamphlet plus a core um a thing for a free class yeah okay so um I will um check inventory of all the things that go into the welcome bags and if we need to order some stuff I you know a lot of it's just Amazon and you know and I know we still have the kitchen towels because we hold certain things aside that we don't sell so we should be okay with that so I'll I mean I usually make them in sense of 10. so you know I mean four will last probably a month or so do you have anything coming in from clean eats to put in the bag um you know they did it in the first that I can ask her for I can ask her for ten more yeah and you know it doesn't hurt you know oh yeah no they always have lots of that stuff on hand that's actually a good idea because um they are now open and um the all the stuff they gave us originally we went through so we'll follow us and does somebody need to Circle back with Publix for more or I didn't she didn't respond so okay that's why she's like all right you're kind of done I don't know if that's what it was or not could have been a bad day yeah I'm not sure um so I will ask Gold's Gym if they have any more of those six months free for new residents um so I'll ask those two Golds and clean eats if anybody wants to ask anybody else like you said it you can ask repeats or you can ask new people they don't have to be the bags don't have to be the same um so and then um yeah so we if there's four left we have maybe a week two weeks three weeks depending on okay I mean I hit all the same restaurants all the time I really should just yeah speak to them when I'm there oh yeah I see what you're saying yeah okay now that sounds good so agenda item number five discussion of the Halloween event details uh and volunteer recruitment so like you guys should have um this it's a Halloween recap sheet Patty sent it out to you guys yeah I had that I Incorporated everything into the notes from that okay every single thing is in the notes from here okay so [Applause] um with that being said I'll just I'll kind of go through and um so I have confirmed Dave and Wendy Gaddis to be the MCS and to help with the flow of contestants their son has been here the past two years she said that they're they're okay like you know he helped but she's doing it you know we've she's done it enough times where she can do it on her own so we don't need a third person to help Corral the cats or the dogs um and then so Pat and Rich are going to do the sign-in table again they're confirmed and then so as far as judges we can either do three judges or five judges so um Deb has confirmed Darlene gray and Molly um and then I have reached out to Frank and Margie bankert I'm waiting to hear back from them and then I I kind of wanted to see if anybody else had like you know like a neighbor or you know like someone that hasn't worked the last two so we can kind of get new people to try out like a volunteer thing so we do have you know over a month before we have to do this so if like say Michael if you have a neighbor or somebody that you can reach out to to ask to see if they want to be a judge or Patty if you have anybody or Susan when she um gets the minutes you know the recap we could ask her if she has anybody in her neighborhood um I can we have a little um I mean we have a small building but um it's still 40 people I can put something on our um bulletin board yeah portal oh good like an HOA portal oh nice and then they can just post stuff to it that's great yeah so then every time we have Beach cleanup and stuff like that we should have him posted on his portal yeah yeah that would be great that's awesome and then if you actually get someone that confirms back and says yes I want to volunteer to help with this event just email Patty and then she'll disseminate it down to the rest of us and then we can keep track so we don't end up with like you know nine people that think they're judges and then you know so we keep track as they're confirmed so I did also confirm Jules Chandler she will volunteer for the event I had her down for a judge but honestly like everybody else will be working a table that's on the foundation board so I I want her to work the foundation table if she can so she's a pending um she's a definite volunteer but I just you know I'd rather find someone else to judge and have her do the foundation table and then okay so and then this is as far as um like the park and rec board so volunteers and the park and rec board I mean No One's Gonna Make You but if you could wear a costume that would be great oh I have mine I'm ready we've all worn costumes in the past it's fun so um and because I can't be here for this event I leave town on Wednesday the 26th and I don't get back till Sunday what I'm gonna do is kind of like the prep work for you guys so I've been working with Kyle um to order all the things that we need from Amazon the gift cards the candy the treat bags so the lady that had volunteered to do the treat bag she emailed me I don't know if anyone forward to you guys and said I can't do it now Anthony will do it okay and Anthony can do it and you can check with him but Kyle ordered some stuff so okay if no one wants to volunteer because I didn't want to like when she sent me the email I wasn't in a position where I could you know what I mean like disseminate out and like we could find someone else I'm just like we've always done it and so you know it's in the budget so Kyle all right ordered some candy and some dog biscuits and then if someone else ends up wanting to volunteer to provide a tree bag we're not doing truck or treat because we couldn't Corral the kids down to the trunk you know what I mean it was even though it was right there it was kind of far and no one understood it's not far they just didn't get it they didn't get it and then so we tried it and it didn't work and then if that's all we were doing it would work but that's not the whole point of it it was just to kind of give them something extra table with the treatment that's what we're gonna do that's exactly what we're so up in the helicopter pad it'll you know there's gonna be um We're not gonna do treat bags for the dogs because there were too many people going my my dog doesn't eat those those are too big those are too small those are hundreds we donated hundreds of dog biscuits which isn't a bad thing to the shelter but anyway so I have a Halloween like a a cute basket we're just gonna put dog biscuits in this basket and if someone wants to walk to the treat table and give their dog a treat I mean Stanley would be jumping up and down on the table trying to get to the treat basket I know her so it's if they want one of the streets and I had Kyle get little ones so you can give little treats to Big give your big dog three treats and give your little dog one treat because you know we did the big Milk Bones and some of those treats were bigger than the dogs that were there so anyway so what I'm going to do ahead of time is get the prize bags together I'm gonna come here and dig out all of the um Halloween decorations that we have you know I have the tablecloths at my house so I'll make sure they're washed and I will bring them here so they're ready for you guys um you can just give me everything yeah yeah I'm just gonna do as much as I can ahead of time since I can't be here like the day before and the day yeah well we could help you with that stuff too so let us know if you need help okay awesome yeah because like you know the tree we had fun last year putting tree bags together we had our little assembly line and so we always gotta have a good time um so right now we only have the two judges with the potential of um how many judges do we need either um three but we've in the past we've always done five okay yeah I just I just said a different idea I mean I'll still post the thing on the uh portal but I showed in our buildings we don't really have any packages we don't have any pets you know I mean if somebody wants a ball they still may want to do it but um uh my customer not building this house for they're you know they're moving in and they have a dog and they got grandkids so I may just do a direct ask oh yeah yeah I love that and let them come with the grandkids and everything yeah well I'll tell you like honestly like it's really hard you can't it's hard to do both like if you're gonna have your grandkids and your dogs no I don't know if they want to don't judge because they have a pet you know people who have pets or more yeah perfect yeah you know what I'm saying yes no that's perfect so so I'll do both but I'm gonna do a direct ask of the wife okay yeah that's awesome yeah and what about like the refreshment table is Nicole going to be there no Nicole is um at a wedding and so like we there will be um one of you guys needs to be in charge of the prizes because it's like 450 dollars Amazon okay so Deb will put you for prizes yeah because I keep the stuff around my neck anyway um somebody needs to be in charge of like the water slash donut table yeah we can do that too right okay okay [Music] and then um so I also bring likes I think Stanley has like six or seven water bowls and I always bring all of them so I'll drop those off earlier in the week just someone needs to make sure that they grab them and fill them with water yeah so does someone want to volunteer for that sure okay and then um decorate Tammy yes sir Tammy on the uh dog treats and the water bowls I mean what is the what is about what are we signing up for uh and making sure that they get filled up or um but we have to buy the review okay so we have to buy the water bowls no no I bring them all in Stanley has a lot so I just bring all of Stanley's travel not glass I bring all of her because she has all sizes so I just bring her um travel water dishes and then the dog treats I have a Halloween basket and we're just gonna put dog treats in a big open basket so if someone wants to grab you know a few or one or seven I don't you know who cares as long as we have them and um they'll just be in an open basket as opposed to treat bags so that can go on it won't obviously go on the ground because they'll help themselves but it'll be up on a table like whether the community table or the um I kind of picture like the donuts on the Hydration Station table so it'll be the water and the donuts and then there's going to be a community table the dog treats can go on the community table okay and you guys [Music] know all the water dishes those water dishes are they were on the edge of the circle like kind of spread out so the dogs can kind of help themselves okay and they were kind of away from the tables so okay away from the donut away from the donuts away from you know they were they were just kind of like along the one Edge um kind of spread out a little bit do you have a diagram of where you want the tables okay you know what okay so the day of the two tens go up and then two tables go under there for the judges right and whether there's three judges or five judges you still kind of need two tables if you know what I'm saying I'm saying you have a diagram or does Kyle have a diagram of that and where he wants the tents where you want the tan and where you just they've been in the same place every year so like I can draw a diagram yeah if you want to okay let's just do it right here and I'll put it on the notes and Patty can see it oh boy Circle okay here's the circle so um here's the water okay so right here we've always had the two tenths for judges and then right here and your back is to the water will be the sign up table benchmark right behind it it's right behind us oh right here okay yeah in that Circle that's higher yeah and then right next to that would be the um you know we have our park and rec board signs so the one that says Hydration Station um you'll have the water and donuts and then on one of and then there's um the community table where's the entrance From the Path right right here okay so the first thing they enter they really have the community table first yes yeah okay and then on the community table you would have like say um the dog treats yeah we got it and then you would have the um first aid that we always have to have down there and you would have um you would have okay the speaker Aaron you or Kyle have to make sure that it's charged up so the microphone's ready for Dave and then someone needs to be in charge of the Halloween music that we kind of pipe through um on um I just brought one of those little portable speakers so Dave would be coming out of the the microphone and the speaker box I would always bring just one of those little waterproof speakers and I you know just you go on your Amazon you hit Halloween music and it just plays okay you'll do the music okay awesome oh and just to confirm Patty you said you were going to do the dog the water the water bottles the water bowls and the treats yeah yeah okay and and the dog treats was that your table let's sit on the table Yeah but yeah it'll I'm bringing in the basket earlier in the week so you just literally no I I'm just saying is that the table that she said yes to before or just doing the dog bowls if that's a table that just has treats nothing else on it no the community table would Dodge speaker and the sign ups yeah okay so yeah okay and honestly none of this stuff is written in stone if you guys get it okay and the sun is in a different place and you want to move the table that's why I really wasn't going to do a diagram because we move stuff around like the first year three times because it was the sun you know what I mean well it's good to know but at least we want to try to follow up the norm like an idea and then like um the the one year we had the young girl who made her own homemade organic dog treats yeah she was over here so we'll just put the um the foundation table over here um where's the kids treats going the kids treats will go on the same community [Music] so it'll be because okay it's a even if it's a six foot table if you just have a little first aid box on the little bitty basket of dog treats it's still going to be really empty yeah okay like so it's pretty much the donuts and the water go here the sign up table is just the sign up table they have the numbers they have the safety pins they have the sheets that need to be filled out so Dave has something to read off of you know the first contestant is blah blah blah so that's all that's on the table for Rich and Pat and they've done it every year so they know what to do and then the Hydration Station somebody needs I always brought in my big yetis so somebody's got to bring in coolers for the water and the ice will be here but somebody's got to bring in coolers my husband is gonna flip a lid if I bring in the yetis you know oh you know and I drop them off at City Hall for two weeks because we're gonna be gone so they don't just whatever cooler if anybody has coolers coolers [Music] seem like I should worry about it because what I've signed up for so I guess what I would do Tammy is um here I mean I could if I could quality how many how many how many um coolers do I need you know we would just bring one and then like have a case of water under the table and kind of you know fill it up as it gets empty is what we we did in the past and then somebody like I've always picked up the donuts too somebody somebody needs to pick up the Halloween donuts like the morning I'll pick up the Halloween yes but John are you gonna leave some for everybody else or are you going to eat them all before they get here so question you know public school I I don't have a account too I don't know who did this last year but no you don't have to do anything they'll already be called in and paid for and you'll just say Bellaire beach park and rec and they'll hand you the boxes you don't have to do anything you walk out really yep that's what I do for the beach cleanup every time so you're good as well as a Kyle and do what come up with the put in the order and say it's right it's ready and how many of this stuff well I usually give the order and they call it in and pay for it so I I just I'm just I count we don't have to figure this out right here but I mean does it does the city uh I mean do they have a record of you know this is how many donuts we bought from Publix from last year and all the rest of that or yeah we're good we got these donut orders down yeah so we're good but I do have a question John so not only are you going to pick up the donuts you're going to supply the cooler with the ice as well well you don't have to the ice and the water will be here oh okay it's just the cooler all you have to bring is an empty cooler just to put it okay a nice big cooler for the water nice so do you do you not already have one you can always use one you know what I'm saying I'll go get one if somebody's got one they want to buy they want to they want to uh I think uh what I'll do is I'll just buy a nice one and follow and uh contributed to the city yeah you know what um Aaron just said that the city might have one so we'll check and we'll let you know I'll have Patty send you an email to let you know the the cooler situation is covered oh you don't have to do that I think we have money in our park and rec board budget because like all the stuff we've been buying over the years so we really like as these events go on we don't have to buy very much so um where I had my back to it at the the uh chili cook-off I mean it seemed like there was a lot of stuff in there so I wouldn't be surprised if we had our thought I'll figure that over there okay okay awesome thank you what else okay you did oh what's their name uh Kimberly Haggerty awesome um Harry h-a-g-g-e-r-t-y um awesome and then so so we have three and then Frank and Margie are pending so like I said if we we just need an odd number so like there isn't like a you know what I mean like a a tie or whatever so let's just hold off on asking anybody else for right now um and then it you know we have three and then hopefully we have Frank and Margie say they can't Mike and James Abel were judges last year and then their daughter and their daughter and then maybe um Leslie Notaro might want to be a judge so we'll just we'll just go you know we'll kind of play it by ear yeah and see so we have a um and I just told her we'll get her something formal um like an invite that we did sooner and thank you for being a judge volunteer or something like that yes invitation to be a judge and the thing that's what you're saying she wants an info sheet basically saying thank you pharmacies blocked their calendar but that's great thank you Michael did you tell her it would be requested very appreciative she wore a costume okay um I like his style yes we'll revisit that because you know honestly if she doesn't care but we don't tell her and she gets here and everybody else has a cost too much she might feel a little like I would have done it if I would have known so just give her the option um and then okay so so that's great and then like I said I'll come earlier and make sure we you know we have a lot of Halloween Deco in-house make sure it's all out and then um on Friday usually we come around one o'clock um but you guys can kind of say um at our October meeting because it'll be before this event you know we can decide what time you guys want to meet on Friday because what makes it so much easier is if like you know you know we need three tables and you get the tablecloths on you decorate them and then the morning of all you have to do is pick them up and pop them outside as opposed to trying to do everything the morning of even if you spend like an hour on Friday it makes Saturday it runs so much smoother earlier this year yeah well we're the exact same as we were the first year last year there was a wedding so we had to have it on Sunday and we had to have it in the afternoon and it was a blazing hot so hot and in the morning when it was 10 to 12 it was so I mean you know the day is is the day it could be different and this is the only event where it's not rain or shine because we cannot bring the dogs in the building right so like if it is a pouring down thunderstorm it's going to be up to Kyle and Aaron to call it and say it's dangerous we can't do it so sorry here's the treat bags have a good day and you know it's um and you're gonna know before you carry a single thing outside kind of like when we did the um the Frank Sinatra thing you know it was just you could see the thunder and lightning and we we made it just you made the adjustment pulled it in yeah and we made the adjustment and pulled it in but like this is it you're gonna make the decision before you drag everything outside and then um this list at the bottom um I already did all this with Kyle so we ordered new numbers and safety pins um the judge's scoring sheet um from the first year to the second year we changed the scoring because the first year it was super super hard to tally up and Kyle they all had a very difficult time so the second year it was adjusted and it was much much easier and much quicker and people weren't waiting around but so like the way it kind of worked was because there's no parade in those there's no Trunk or Treat so like you know you do all the kids you do all the dogs the judges make you know all of their decisions they take their forms they hand them to Kyle and Aaron to tally up and while that's going on that's when the kids eat the donuts and you know get something to drink and um you know the dog gets a treat bag you know maybe someone signs up to buy a brick um and you know the little treat bags will be handed out then so and then once the judges Tower everything up Kyle will bring everything back out he'll give the winners to um Dave to announce and double have the the prize bags and they will literally say kids first place kids second place kids third place so you know even though the same the dollar amounts are different so you just want to make sure that the right thing goes to the right kid or slash doggy parents what else should I be doing for you that other than holding the stuff what do you mean well I don't have any assignment check do you want me to just help Wendy run everything oh where do you have them well you are going to disseminate the prizes no you're going to be the picture person okay okay like last year when I was giving the prizes away no one took pictures so like we didn't even have pictures of The Prize winners so Deb you're the camera girl your camera camera lady is that good yeah it may have been him I can't remember so basically I could move around I could help with the foundation table I'll just roll okay yeah and that you'll basically do what I did like you make sure everything is where it needs to be there and um because a lot of times people are just standing there watching the show because it's cute and you want to watch them but you're like oh my gosh it's over the donuts to make it to the table because like if it's super super hot you won't want to bring the donuts out right away because they'll melt the lamps okay uh Tammy yes so last year we did not get pictures of the winners not the way we should have and so um this time that was that's Deb's job the whole time is to take pictures at the event and then she's going to hang on we we leave the prizes in the office until it's time to hand them to the winners because it's like 450 and no one would steal it but we just want to you know what I mean we just want to make sure because we have had people I don't know if you remember but I mean we had people that drove for an hour yeah to enter and and that's a thing they were late so they couldn't enter so there there's got to be a cut off time to say you have to be signed up by you know say it's 11 30 or well no it's starting at 10 so 10 30. yeah you have to be signed up by 10 30. yeah you have an hour to come in a half an hour to come in Mingle yeah 10 30 let's make that and yeah and then if someone if someone comes in at 10 45 you know it's like it's they can participate but maybe they're not involved in the prizes they know yeah it's real it's really hard to tell those cute little kids know when they're late but it's like it's it's one of those things like if it's feasible and like say they're halfway through the kids and a kid and a kid walks up I know last year we let them do it because we just you know they were just number 20 and they went last and it flowed but if it's like we're done with all the kids and we're halfway through the dogs and two kids walk up no then it's too late so you'll know if you can work them in without creating chaos okay or if it's just like we're sorry you know the cutoff time was you know we're already through all the kids so um so I will yeah that's perfect different angles like you guys will see different things last year there was a dog fight so be mindful of that like it was good that like the the doggy parents took the you know the dog that was a little crabby home um it happens was it your dog no no anyway so um we we have ordered every single thing that we need from Amazon I will take care of the donut order um I'll pre-make the treatment or pre-made the gift bags and then I'll let you guys know um like when a good time is to make the tree bags if you guys are available and we can do like the little assembly lines that will be good um does anybody have any questions about anything with this we have one more month to talk about it so you know like it'll all of this crazy will be typed up on the minutes for next month and then we can just see if there's any little last minute things I have a quick question here says Parks and Rec all costumes darling great and Laura French if you want us as I mean I'm going to be either a contestant or I'm going to man a table here you want me to get a tank you want ah I need to get a costume and do I understand this correctly I'm perfectly happy to do that yes yes okay yep I mean it could be you wearing a cowboy hat and a bandana like it you know yeah it doesn't have to be crazy that is yeah um we're quack and uh the city will set them up but we can just uh call up for Kyle and Aaron and say when you guys want to do this we'll come over there and help you kind of a deal like that at that time to get the uh like water and figure all that stuff out we can do you guys do that the Friday before you on we'll decide that all right what time should we arrive on day of uh 9 40 9 30. that's not enough time you've got to get everything because the tens you got to set the tens up the day of because you can't set the tents up and get them out the door so the tens have to be set up the morning of you've got to pick the tables up and carry them out there carry the coolers out there right well Aaron is yeah the guys are not here Aaron and Kyle um like last year like Lynn and Kyle have always come to it so I kind of assumed that that Kyle and Aaron would come to it um well what time are they going to be there though nine the week nine is adequate if the board yeah nine is adequate because you guys will come on Friday the day before for an hour and basically set up decorate the tables put the tablecloths on get I know I know exactly what you did last year and so does Patty we'll handle it Tammy said we'll discuss that at the next meeting because that's prior to the event yeah because we will have one more meeting before um we you know the end of October so okay okay does anybody have anything else for this but you said you're making the cheap eggs right yeah or I I will if you guys wanna I'll send out an email if you guys are available and want to come help yeah because that was fun last year it was fun yeah you just let us know yeah because I don't know oh if things are in House well we could always take this stuff home and do it at home as well yeah take it home next door um can I make a suggestion now yeah can everyone with their own phone take a picture of this diagram just so they have a general idea and I am not sending it to everyone so everyone can just take a picture of it now we'll we'll text it to you John I like it okay yeah thank you and again you guys can it you know if the we we can do can we adjust as you will but it's just at least a thought and pretty much it's what we've done the last two years like so if you look at the pictures from last year or the year before and I have them on my phone um because when I did this list I literally looked at the pictures on my phone to make sure I did everything because we did get enough pictures last year that we were able to um you know I was able to put this list together without missing anything okay that's not gonna look good but you see the whole shadow of me and my phone all right all right I can send it to him where are we okay so is everybody good with the Halloween event for now okay so the next um so the next agenda item is the health and wellness Fair did you guys talk about this at all at the meeting last month yeah okay perfect so is there any updates for the um the health and wellness Fair on because if if you guys were independently going to ask [Applause] um did you guys get the so the official letter was written did you guys get a copy of the official letter for this year okay so I'm gonna have Patty email you guys the official letter that's that is the letter that has to be changed in my notes I have it highlighted that it needs to be changed but I already changed it oh you did yes with the correct date yes okay and the time okay perfect for the time last month yeah yeah it's um we adjusted it um by an hour so instead of doing ten to two we did 10 30 to 1 30. okay so we just cut it by one hour because it was always fizzing out and then we can tell people did you I didn't listen we only um yeah so we only cut it by one hour there's the minutes yeah that's we missed that it's um 10 30 to 1 30. and that's why I said the letter was wrong oh yeah it's not wrong okay that's why I was telling you the letter was wrong okay 10 30 to 1 30. yeah so we cut it by one hour it was always ten to two so we cut it by a half an hour in the beginning and yeah that's good at the end okay okay and um what time do you want us to show up here on that day of 9 30 because we will tell people and it says it on the letter that some of them schlep in a ton of stuff some of them can set up in six minutes yeah so we tell them you have an hour if you you need it and if you don't need it just make sure you're here to pay your twenty five dollars and because that takes a lot because you know like it was a lot of running around last year to find people and and especially if they were trying to pay by credit card so if they had a check or cash it was easy and then there had to be a checklist and who paid and you know to make sure to check her cash it's just 25 okay so we I can I do have to change that on the letter okay but see this is the thing some of them can't pay by Checker cash because of the nature of their business like Baker maybe the pot guy too there's a marijuana guy he may not be able to pay by credit cards yeah some of the businesses because they're doing it through a business account they can't they like BayCare wouldn't bring a 25 check like they want to use a corporate credit card okay yeah so like I I want to say six people did a crap by credit card last year that was it so if they're a small independent they had no problem but like even like I know clean eats did a credit card a lot of them did a credit card and and if they sent an employee they definitely wanted to do their corporate credit card so we'll just leave it the way it is and it wasn't terrible it was just coordinating finding the person and finding Kyle and getting them to the front desk right here at the same time because it had to be done right here because we don't have the city doesn't have a square where Kyle could go to them and do it at their table they had to go to college I have a square I know but it's not connected to the um so we can't you know how much those things cost ten dollars or free yeah they're free I got mine yeah yeah okay so you know what like so then we can um we can put this off one more month I will have Patty send out the revised letter to you guys and then we can do um like if you have people that you've emailed and like Deb got I know the Pilates person so we will clean up this if if you have people that you have reached out to already and they have confirmed let Patty know and then I will get this all cleaned up for next month uh John did you reach out to the eye doctor I did appointment I had [Music] so I moved that uh back to the end of October and I figured I would uh talk to them when I was in there at that time okay I suspect I I may wind up uh getting a cataract removed so I'm making another professional to talk to and I have a quick uh point of order kind of uh question here regarding the Sunshine Law so for instance that maybe this different vendors outside of the meeting okay is it a okay or is it forbidden to talk to another member all the committee okay about coordinating something like this that's not going to get sunshine you know what I'm saying it is it is yes so John John I think if you want to confirm with anybody whether anything was done any type of communication has to go through Patty has to go through uh uh Patty uh Gentry yeah I mean if you want to call if you want to call and say Tammy I'm not going to be there today that's I mean or text me that's fine but but Patty sends out the invite she sends out you know whether you're going to accept or decline you know what I mean so like today's season couldn't come last minute and she contacted Patty that's the way it should be but I don't think it's against the I mean the Sunshine Law it's just it's if if we're talking about or making a decision on something that's going to happen that's what we can't talk about off the Record so um it's not like we can't talk Okay then if we have something like we have two people dividing up four different jobs it's okay for them to talk and coordinate I mean well Deb and I'm out yeah absolutely that's a decision-making Thing by the group it's a decision-making thing between a couple of people working on something that's okay right yes because what you're doing has already been discussed and disseminated and assigned so it's already public knowledge of what your that group is like that is like a sub team basically yeah okay thank you okay and then [Music] so whoever said let's just do this whoever said they were going to reach out to people let's be proactive and reach out to them and see by next month if we can't have some results now that once we get the um letter yes okay from Patty okay and then um the welcome bag contents for number seven we've already talked about um except that was how many more things you need for your bags right this is this is the contents of your bags what's going in them oh yeah I'll have to do that so I'll just um I'll update that you'll see that update in the minutes because I'll send it to Patty because I didn't do that before I got here didn't have time um and then I didn't see in um was in the minutes for um agenda item number eight um so did you guys decide who's taking Beach cleanup what month yeah it's all done very nice yeah okay how did I miss that page four and in next month's minutes I'm removing all the other activities and I have it you'll get it like this next month just the beach cleanups okay okay the first time I included everything all the events we were doing which is yeah sweetie you don't have it here um okay um okay so John you have October 7th that is okay so what I did was I have this little recap sheet that I'm going to email to Patty and then um I'm out of town I'll take a picture of it I'm out of town that weekend but like I'll make sure that before I leave town the um like call it the beach cleanup kit is here at City Hall and then there's instructions like step by step on what you know I typically do for a beach cleanup and you've been to enough to know but you know what I'm saying well it should be included in the minutes anyway so everybody knows for next time yes and um oh she has them okay um so yeah yeah I'll put it in Southern see nothing stays though nothing stays at City Hall because typically in the past I've done I've always you know I've done it 99 of the time so um oh see this was my thing it's for the lead person their tasks so what I'll do is break this I'll take this nobody needs to do anything you don't need to send it to Patty I'll take this I already have a copy and I will break it down from the lead person to the tasks and then I will send this to Patty and ask her to send it to everyone so everyone has it okay excellent thank you and Michael you should take a picture of this oh John John's the first one so I'll send this to John now but it will be in the notes yeah but the kid John will be in Aaron's office right Aaron does he need to pick up the donuts yes he needs to pick up the donuts water ice Donuts John you need a cooler for Beach cleanup too because I always just use my uncle and you know I always have my cute little table and my nice little Bella Beach tablecloth but you don't have to have that if you don't want to well I don't know my big deal is I'm going to be using my uh Volkswagen Bug convertible to do all this so I might want to look at it always a mess well the biggest yeah I guess the biggest thing is the cooler and I'm close um all on Fridays I'll figure out uh but the stuff is at City Hall I go there today uh you know a day earlier and that's and that's on the instruction sheet I always come here the day before and and pick up ice and water I just bring my cooler and then throw it in there and then um Aaron will either hand you or email you the receipt for Publix and then I usually keep the stuff at my house but now that we're like trading who's the lead we'll just leave the kit at City Hall all the time so like you know if it's my turn I'll come and pick it up like you know I do like everybody else does as opposed to just storing it at my house sure that would be perfect and that's like got the um the first aid kit the bug the hand sanitizer the gloves sign up sheets garbage bags clipboard pens yeah um I don't know if you have the uh parking passes do you wear the best damn no no best there okay parking passes that's that's important so the parking passes for the non-residents and we do have them and um they will get ticketed the cop shows up at every Beach cleanup and he will give it they have to have the parking pass and then you have to make sure they don't drive off with it because that's happened and then you know it does say one hour for Beach cleanup but um but then you can use it forever yeah yeah um if they drive off with it yeah geez those are kind of valuable well I mean it literally says you know that that street only for Beach cleanup for one hour so I mean it's really not that handy Yeah clean up anytime they want if it's uh no well if it's [Music] um honestly it's the same people every time and we know them now and no you know if they drive off with it it's going to be an accident and they'll they'll break like if they're volunteering their time to clean our beaches or you know the beaches they're not going to try to steal the parking pass but yeah those are in the kit too so this is perfect Tammy is it step by step it's perfect that's perfect and I'm gonna I you could see I like the list so I'll just put it in the list format everybody will get the list and we'll always have it in the records too okay excellent perfect and this is the first time you we're sharing with you you've done everything all this time we so appreciate you finally sharing I'm relinquishing her husband must be thrilled I'm such a control freak I'm sorry cleaning out her area is getting rid of this well I had to make room for the foundation stuff my husband for these nice shelves in I was like oh I can fill those in like six minutes anyway okay so we're good on beach cleanup that's awesome and then um agenda number nine other businesses anybody have anything else they want to discuss I have a question yes ma'am um any follow-up information on the cover-up for outside Aaron like no the um yeah like I think you guys were supposed to get three bids well one we got one bid and that was uh Michelle's going to Kyle quite a while ago um what I would say was like 50 000 or 35 000. it's like 20. okay I think uh College information and it's been a minute so I visited that so okay but nothing else okay that's all for me sorry anybody uh move that we are during the meeting wait a minute but wait a minute so yeah oh yeah okay okay so I am going to be resigning from secretary oh no so I can help with secretary on the foundation because I'm needed there as well we have more volunteers here so if somebody wants to be secretary how about you Aaron he can't be Secretary of course not I know I know you're teasing yeah hey he's like okay any interest Michael if not maybe we can contact Susan oh so I could but uh my plate is full yeah well I mean I'm here I mean it's yeah right here uh but my uh I I could I'm just saying I could and I'll wait and see if Susan wants okay that's fair enough okay why don't we have Patty um Gentry email Susan and explain that that Deb had to resign from being Secretary of the parking report and see if she's interested because John I I'm assuming since you've not for once said a word that you're not interested well I I not only because I'm gone for you know I'm not there for five meetings and all this that makes sense I just I just don't think it makes a sense for me to do it I understand okay no that's that's cool no so we'll um I'll have Patty email Susan and then we'll just vote on it at the beginning of the next meeting what's really nice and Deb can say is Patty does a very night I mean Patty hands you everything to fill out I mean you don't have to you're not recreating the will it's all bullet pointed um here she basically sends me I do a little work on it just so I put my little charts in but she basically sends me this format and I just I give myself space to write because I'm a miserable writer and I make like I'm already this is made for next week because I looked at it and I said all right let me really just consolidate it now to beach cleanup since that's all we're doing but otherwise that wouldn't be here but all this is all taken care of and she emails this to you so yeah and it really it's just bullet points like you you can write as much but it transferred so one she sent the whole documentation um and like I said I still want to go with what I said yeah but um I can't read my own handwriting yes that's my biggest issue I can't read my own hand right yeah I'm not too far off from you look at this mess I don't even know how I go home and make notes out of it is something that I've actually been um just in transparency been working on because when I'm writing scribbly I'm not actually saving any time yeah as when I take my time to form my letters almost just laziness more than anything it's almost like shorthand yeah unless you just really felt like your profession should have been a doctor yeah it does and I look at me like what is that um I texted them to you so you could text them to John I sent them to him but I think I'm emailing them to him okay okay yeah that's why I sent you the two things okay so I will have Patty send an email to Susan and then we'll just go from there and then I don't need a motion to resign or something I just resigned okay no I think you're okay yeah formal letter but you're still with us oh yeah oh yeah okay okay she's not resigning from the board she's just not going to be the secretary okay um I was wondering if you guys could check your calendars and see if the um because I I know we're going to be um you know there's going to be you know just the one hour thing on the 27th but I wanted to see if the 12th or the 19th can I change or whatever but I'll do it what the secretary are you sure yeah yeah well how about this if you want to do it I can help you a little bit until you're up and running on it that's fair okay okay oh thank you you you would like okay would someone like to make a motion yeah I know that Michael because wait a minute before we do that are you setting a day 's meeting well now we kind of backtrack for one second because um Michael just said he would be the new secretary so patty just made a motion for Michael to be um the new park and ref board secretary and I'd like to second that motion all in favor aye aye okay so thank you Michael's our new secretary thank you very much Michael and then as far and then we were talking about dates for the next month's meeting um in in
