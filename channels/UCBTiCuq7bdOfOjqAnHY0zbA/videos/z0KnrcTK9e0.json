second second second by mike sable all in favor any approach the agenda is approved now we move to citizens comments if any citizens would like to address the council about a topic that's not already on the agenda please raise your hand and wait to be called on we ask that you limit your comments to no more than three minutes yes sir please come up to the podium i'll give us your name and address and uh sure my name is patrick drummond i'm the son of rezone drummer who's the property owner of 114 16th street valley beach for the last 19 years i'm here on behalf of my mother to address a twenty nine thousand one hundred twenty four dollars and ninety seven cent fee slash green that's been levied against my mother's property for a 2021 one hundred registration fee the landlord registration fee was paid on february 26 2021 via bank issued check and proof of payment was provided by fifth bank and the document was given to the city manager and it appears as though the city did not cross the payment that was made once i was made aware of this i made the payment in person to the city manager along with penalties that were assessed the city continues to invoice my mother for this fee with a seven percent increase until this day the city changed its landlord registration contact address of mine without notifying either me or my mother had my mother and i have been given a chance to resolve this issue before it would reach this level we would have today i'm simply probably asking for an amicable and fair resolution to this matter thank you very much mr drummond um we're aware of the situation and i can assure you we will look into thank you very much any other citizens like to make a comment yes sir thank you my name is alan mintz at 125 8th street and my family and i have owned this house since the 1970s i'm here today because we have a problem with a plant called the norfolk island pine which is actually an exotic plant not indigenous to florida on the adjacent property to ours there are two of these trees that are just growing out of sight and one the largest one has got a big incision down its middle and it at this point has to be regarded as a potential catastrophe there are several houses that border up on where these trees are actually they're not trees they're conifers and they go back to the beginning of time and i'm going to circulate pictures of the damage caused by the wind shear of 2020. when we had a mini tornado here and it damaged these springs around my pool and that forced me to be in the pool quite a bit to get the remains of that tree out of there since 2003 the adjacent property has been abandoned the home on the property has been torn down but the two north organic times on the property remain and continue to grow and grow significantly i'm going to add at this point that there are 22 of these norfolk island pines that i've counted in this area you can go out the front door turn left and you'll see five or six of them they are huge and they're growing and growing and they're growing in years where we haven't had hurricane issues and climate issues the climates here seem to indicate that big change according to the research done by the university of florida norfolk island pines thrive in humidity bright light and have a high salt tolerance the research also says this naturally coastal tree does not hold up well during hurricanes the tree can lose all its branches in the wind i have spoken to the owners of the property twice they have never resided in the property they live out of state this is perez who some of you might know was one of the owners she was in bel air baby several years ago i also spoke to her son malcolm on several occasions regarding my concern and telling him of the damage both owners did not respond to my concerns today i am here to share my apprehension about further damage or destruction to my power in addition to the huge size of the largest mr mint you and i close those thoughts okay we've gone past the three minutes and we'll be glad to speak with you going forward after this meeting okay any other says and comments all right we'll move on to item number three this is a presentation from fire chief jeffrey davidson of the pinellas suncoast fire and rescue district and this is concerning the future of that district good evening mayor vice mayor council members and our community uh thank you for allowing me some of your time tonight to talk about the future of the vanilla suncoast fire and rescue district my name is jeffrey davidson i'm the fire chief another suncoast fire rescue district proudly serving city of bel air beach i was blessed to come here to canal suncoast in november of 2021 i've been serving in the fire service for 34 years now i have a master's degree in public administration a master's degree in emergency and disaster management and i'm very proud to say that i'm a united states army reserve veteran so thank you again for having me here at the time that i was hired here in november 2021 our new finance director aaron brooks also came on board and since we've been here we've taken a deep dive into the financial situation of the district we presented to our board of commissioners at our main meeting showing that we have a serious financial problem and that we would look into all areas which included some scenarios to help fix this situation however none of the scenarios that we studied were able to provide a permanent solution i said to my commission at our meeting in mayhem i would come back in june with a recommendation for a permanent solution and i wanted to be able to share with our residents that problem and recommended solution i understand have a few minutes and thank you very much for your time all right uh suncoast fire rescue district for those of you who are not aware and we started in 1953 and now uh we are known as the nelson coast fire rescue district since the year of 2000 we currently have three fire stations throughout these cities that we serve which included indian shores in iraq's beach bel air shores and miller beach and an unincorporated area of oakhurst in the county right so when aaron did our deep dive into the finances we didn't put together a small graph that's kind of hard to see in such a short period of time that i'm more than happy to meet with anyone and everyone to explain exactly what i'm going over but if you see there in the green slides that shows our revenues that's our income the red is our expenses and the blue bar is our reserve fund balance and we have a very unique situation in that we have a fixed income there are 18 fire departments in the county and we are the only ones that have a fixed income and that is just the way that our charter was written that it would have to go to the voters to change that so you can see over time the green there's some changes in the middle here where we had an increase and we were able to get a refund for some cares money but the green on the right side just stays flat and the red you see our expenses keep going up we need to replace fire trucks and equipment training and to balance those we've happened to use our fund balance which you can see in the blue continues to go down which means by fiscal year 2025 we will be out of money so we did a five-year projection and we looked at a few um scenarios so here's the five-year projection i understand it's kind of hard to see but again i'm more than happy to meet with anybody this is also on our website psfrd.org right but we need a permanent solution so in our five year projection you can see here that fiscal year 2025 we go negative and we put a couple of scenarios together can you all hear me okay okay from here it sounds like a little thing we put a few scenarios together we looked at we've been working extremely hard with the county on some things such as our ems funding which has been underfunded for many many years back to 2010 and we're looking at if we if we were to get our funding back to the minimum levels and if we were to get a reimbursement on the vehicle that we paid for what would that do and that does not solve our problem it buys us some time it buys us two more years and we feel pretty good that we're working positively towards that but it's not a permanent solution next we looked at if what if we cut our services which we never want to do what if we cut personnel and compensation by 25 and you absolutely cannot do that even if it were possible it only provides a couple years and we're still in a financial situation that we're in right so we analyzed all these things and and come to present that we need a permanent solution a solution that includes the replacement and strategic location of our fire stations we have three fire stations one which is not a permanent fire station it's actually rented space another one the other two actually are over 50 years old and in dire need of replacement and we do not have the money to replace them we also need to build an emergency operations center which is where we would run and help run bel air beach and the other communities during times of extreme incidents whether planted or unplanned things such as hurricanes so our stations during a hurricane when the storm is actually over us there comes a point where we have to cease operations keep them put people putting people in the streets until that storm passes and with the beaches our stations have to evacuate to an emergency operations center where we can continue to plan and work together with the agencies for the next week and what's going to happen as soon as the storm passes and for the next week and we do not have that facility let's show you real quick some of our fire stations we've had lots of visitors here lately to come visit them but this is our station that's in indian shores and you can see it's not an actual fire station there's been a dire need for one for many years and land is very hard to come by but we needed to provide that service this is actually a rented space in an office building and the truck the branding truck is sitting outside and that's a bank building with lots of traffic this is our station in downtown indian rocks beach in the business district and this station is from built in 1965 and if you can see on the very left side of the slide that little portion right there that was the original fire station from 1965 and it was built on and added to over time um on the right side you see a picture that we had to evacuate for a few days to be tempted for termites but one of the things that we want to do with this permanent solution is relocate that station further north and to be able to serve the city of bel air beach with better response times we've identified some properties on the northern end of indian rocks beach and we're going to continue to be able to build a fire station there and serve bel air beach and then this is our station on the mainland which is from 1971 it's over 50 years old but you can see that that's not a hurricane-proof building it's not even a hard rain proof of buildings kind of sad but our firefighters live there to serve and protect 24 hours of baby seven days a week 365 days a year this is the location that we own this property and this is where we'd like to build an emergency operations center as well so real quick uh safe this picture on the left is our fire station 28 and on the right it's a modern fire station the difference in not just the aesthetics but everything that goes into the planning for the health of the firefighters and for response times and cleaning of equipment you know one of the things that's so bad with all of our fire stations going back to this station here we don't have any public meeting space this building's not ada compliant none of our buildings technically are so we can't hold our meetings there so we rotate between this facility and indian shores and we want to have a place that we can hold our public meetings but also not being a liability and to add to that with all the things that have gone on with copit firefighters and paramedics go through an extreme decontamination process through every patient contact that they have and they need to have a place where they can shower and change their clothes and do everything that they do before coming into their living quarters and then eventually bringing that home to their families that's a top priority for us as well we got hit pretty hard with copen last year all right i'm gonna try to speed up these there's just a couple more pictures of some modern fire stations it's a clear water station on the beach that's under construction st petersburg station seven which is their model for other fire stations and donating station 61. those are just some pictures of what modern fire stations look like so again aaron and i did a 20-year projection and in that we included everything that we need not the things that we want or the things that we'd like to have but everything that we need to survive right we need highly trained personnel we need fire stations we need firefighters we need paramedics we need equipment we need training and all these things to survive and provide the best service to our community we came up with a 20-year projection on how we could accomplish those things which includes the rebuilding and relocation of all three fire stations to better serve our district and we came up with a the lowest number possible to accomplish those things at our meeting in june our fire commission board meeting in june i presented a permanent solution recommendation to my boy just make recommendations to my board and that was the addition of an anglorum tax to our existing funding formula at 8.67 military and that number was the lowest number that we could come up with that accomplishes all these things and that's where the 20-year projection is very hard to see on here but through that we build and pay off all three fire stations we get our reserves to where they need to be right now we're at the bare minimum of reserves once we go any lower then the state has to step in and that's going to be an issue so we need to get ahead of these things that there's no timeline today right the my board i had asked them to direct me to go seek the ballot language to be put in front of the voters in november i'll bring that back in july and again i'm speaking of it but it has not been approved by my board yet but the way we are going to have it written is that it would be a fixed rate of a 0.67 bills rate that can never go higher unless it too were to go back to the voters but we did a 20-year projection and it should not be to go any higher unless say 10 years from now we have such an influx of population and realize hey we need to add a fourth fire station or more personnel or whatever for our fire government ratings and to better serve it would have to go back to the voters um so in our july meeting i'm going to present the battle language to my board and they will vote to move forward on that or not and between july and november uh once let's see it is approved by the board in july between july and november i would like to meet with as many residents as possible to show them what exactly this is for where the money would be going and what never to tell anybody how to vote but here's what will happen if this passes and if it doesn't pass we will cease to exist that's just a painful truth of it all but being able to get this passed by the voters it's a solution that builds healthy fire stations in the best locations it allows us to be fiscally responsible and cost efficient it gives us the best response times with how the stations are built for flow and a sustainable district serving this community i want to stay forever but without that we're not going to exist i left business cards in the back my information is up there jeffrey davison aaron brooks is our finance director again you can see any of this information on our website psfrd.org and i'm more than happy to answer any questions with anybody at any time just give me a call my cell phone numbers on my card um more than happy to meet with anyone and everyone for total transparency on what we need here for the district to continue to serve one thing i'd like to add is i have 44 families that depend on serving in this district 44 families that depend on being employed by the district and if things get any worse some of those employees are going to start to leave and we're not going to be able to replace them and this district will get dissolved so thank you for your time i'm happy to answer any questions without taking any more of your time today thank you very much for allowing me to present today chief davidson i i don't have a problem taking questions from the council i don't want to go into a long discussion but if there's a burning question that someone would like to ask now yes vice mayor and perhaps you probably know the answer to this as well is this on the big c radar well yes and no because uh this district only only covers um indian shores indian rocks beach and uh bellar beach and bella and baylor right right as far as the big c goes and then we also have a 5300 parcels in the mainland there as well but as far as the big ceilings known because it only goes we only go down to indian shores so so my condolences for having to care for a high value asset park in a saltwater environment what that's like response times i mean we've heard you stand up here before and say we have uh world-class standards and response time so i mean why is this an issue how much are you going to shave off that in the future we do have excellent response times into all our areas but as you can see with the population growth and the density this weekend give an example you're not getting anywhere anytime even with lights and sirens on you're lucky to be going 20 miles an hour pedestrians all over and we need to be able to get to any emergency the county standard is seven and a half minutes but we've been doing that in the four and five minute range and we want to be able to continue continue to do that but we can't plan when it's too late right when it's so bad that we can't get there now we start planning and funding it's going to take two more years we need to get ahead of the problem and that's where the study came in that's the best place to relocate our fire stations as well just one last question then is you talk about an ed doloro and i'm wondering is is a is a user be a candidate for this thing i think of it more as a level playing field where everybody receives the same service so rather than you know make it disproportionate depending on what what you owe on his property why shouldn't everybody be charged like a black user if you retire well that's a great question but that's how it has been here for the longest time the way our charter was written it was a flat rate assessed fire assessment fee and it's not sustainable currently everybody does pay a flat rate assessment and there is a disparity and depending on the value there's a lot of things i'll give you some examples if you live in a 400 square foot home right you pay 360 dollars you know a mobile home for example mobile home catching on fire wants us going reality is we're there for about two hours and it's going to be a total loss with the minimum amount of firefighters being put in danger because we're going to do defensive operations things like that so that same homeowner is paying 360 for that single black mobile home could live in the 5 000 square foot home and they're also paying 360 which is a big difference in resources you know that home you know we could be there for 10 hours with 40 firefighters so there's a big difference in that and the disparity when it comes to a flat rate we did increase our flat rate for the voters back in 2019 knowing that it was just a short-term solution because that rate never increases but our expenses continue to increase so the only solution would be to have the flat rate and a small ad floor now that is the permanent solution take out the fire stations if we didn't need the fire stations which we do let's say we had three fire stations that were brand new in 84 we would still need an avalor to survive it would just would be a smaller out of lower but the good thing about the way it's going to be presented if that's what is approved by the board is it's capped at a 0.67 cannot go any higher it can go lower right but once we get into that 20 years and the fire stations are paid off we're going to be looking at what's the next 20 years going to look like and i can't tell you if we were not here what someone else would charge you i can't tell you that but i will tell you that the millage rate for clear water is 2.62 mils and the millage rate for largo is 2.91 mils so even with and somebody is going to have to provide that service so even with the flat rate in the 0.67 military it's still much more cost effective and less money to the citizens but you're also having your this this is your this is your fire department you have control over this fire department you tell me you need something something i mean we're gonna plan for that we're gonna be there that's just what we do that doesn't necessarily happen when you get stuck into a bigger organization i you know spent my career i grew up in south florida retired from there and it's totally different when you get lost into a big fire department so you have your own community fire department here and i'm sure that's what they really that's we love it we absolutely love it our friends love knowing people in the community and being out there so again i couldn't tell you what somebody else would charge you but that's what they currently charge to people that live outside their city thank you very much yes sir anyone else on the council yeah just i i'm like this is a good night to choose to be here because clearly there's something hot on the agenda so you've got a lot of people a lot of people listening but um back to the flat rate i have to say your scenario of the of the mobile home compared to a 5 000 square foot home that doesn't play out when you're looking at a thousand square foot condo you have to go through a building and defend everyone in that building absolutely and so that's where the flat rate is really for when you look at it from a common sense standpoint we have several condos on our beach and that probably makes better sense of a flat rate and i would like to see i mean it would be nice to see how the scenario works out at flat rate and what that looks like for all the residents rather than that's one thing that i'll be able to do uh we have an interactive spreadsheet from the property and razor's office which this week i should have the updated version but i'll be able to sit with every single resident and tell them exactly what this would cost them and there is a difference there's some someone might see an increase of um eight dollars somebody could see we run scenarios where somebody has an increase of sixty dollars you know and it depends on the assessed value of your home how long you've been there if you have save our homes there's a lot of variables in there but i'll be able to sit with each and every person to let them know what what this would cost them yeah i think the flat rate's just a more equitable share if you will of the services and we appreciate everything you do i can see the added value to bringing in new buildings and that sort of thing and certainly wouldn't be behind it and i'd like to get more details so i'll be in touch thank you very much i'm also interested uh are there any other communities in the county that are just doing flat rate no sir we are so in this county there are 18 uh fire departments uh there are 14 dependent fire districts which those are ones that are attached to municipalities and there are four independent fire districts us it's ourselves east lake uh plum harbor and leon they all have uh avalor we're the only ones in the entire county that do not have an avalor and that's just the way our charter was written but it's been a long-term problem like we've always had to go back to the voters we made some small increases knowing it was not a permanent solution so we are the only ones that do not have that that's just how our charter was written didn't we attempt that once before in the past and the outcome of the election was challenged uh yes sir so a lot of a lot of people don't know so it was brought to the voters in 2016 and did pass successfully to implement in avalor however the ballot language was thought to be unclear they had talked about lowering the cap so the state statute uh is 3.75 mills the charter our charter is three mills but the state statute trump's charter so the cap on is 3.75 mills and in that they had talked about asking for a half of a mil they didn't talk about a cap where it could go to but they didn't say that they were going to lower the cap and it was challenged because some people thought their taxes were being lowered when they actually weren't paying attacks so that they get challenged and it was ruled that it was unclear there were some things that happened in those years where some of the residents had felt that um there was a deception there when i wasn't here but there was there was not it was just for fully written language and then it continued that we knew we needed this but at the time we they didn't my predecessors didn't feel is the right time to go back to the voters so we spent years re-establishing those relationships and building healthy relationships and we're at the point where this is something we absolutely have to do okay i think councilmember shirley has raised a valid point i would also like to see the math done where everyone that's paying a plant right now there's a payment height and let's see where where it meets them in the middle somewhere just so that we have what other options i do know that if we lose this fire district that the county will charge way more than what you're proposing but i don't know what that is yes one last observation we just went through the stormwater museum and my recollection of the process is that it's not chiseled and granted those rates can be adjusted you're doing certain bounds and if you want to go outside outside those bounds if there's just a public hearing process no sir well i'm not saying no sir on what you're talking about i'm talking no sir on our ballot and how we're going to present this so the way it's going to be written is is going to be capped at 0.67 it cannot go any higher no i'm talking about usage fees not the end of war i'm talking about we went through this stormwater user fee thing and my understanding of the process was that that's that isn't particularly great i thought within a certain bounds it was adjustable i understand if you wanted to go outside those bounds there was just a public the way our charter was written through the state of florida is any increase actually even a decrease has to go before the voters when it comes to the assessment fee that's just how our charter was written okay thank you very much thank you for your time again i left business cards in the back anybody like to call me thank you thank you for coming tonight so um you know i think um council member jody that if we just go with one option i think we may find that this hybrid approach um may actually smooth things out with two different groups when you're talking about the condos versus homes my guess would be i will look at the numbers that if i'm in group a you know i may say that well the flat fee for me just with a flat fee doesn't work as well for me as it does for the room b but if we're able to kind of like smooth the curve with having part of the revenue coming in with a flat fee and part of the revenue coming in with an ad alarm i think you may find at the end of the day that both of the groups just using the groups as a condo group and a home group may actually feel that that's more fair in the long term just guess because i haven't seen the numbers yet but i think that may be a good approach you say in all the other locations use only at alarm yes sir okay so is that something you guys talk through a little bit yeah that and that's an excellent point um and that's what this would be this would be a hybrid system where there would be the flat rate and an avalor because if you on your points if you were to take the flat rate that everybody pays and convert that to a millage rate right take the flat rate divided by the value of the home there's a huge disparity in what some people pay some people pay you know one mill in you know where somebody else might pay one quarter of a mill when you compare the values so those are great points yes sir all right uh i appreciate you coming out and uh presenting uh the information to us thank you thank you very interesting and we i'm sure we'll be discussing this more thank you thank you all right now we are on to agenda item 4. that's the law enforcement report from sergeant mcknight with the pinellas county sheriff's department thank you mr mayor i have with me the may 2022 monthly report from the sheriff's office for the city of pennsylvania on the first page for the ucr property and personal crimes report there is only one crime reporter and that was for an assault the second page shows number of arrests made in the city during the month of may there are five people arrested for a total of six charges if you have any questions please please stop and ask me we will ask you at vayner okay the third page shows the deputy activity there are 714 events in the city of other beach for the month of may resulting in 826 units responding that's a combination of calls for service from citizens and also proactive law enforcement activity from the deputies assigned to the beach the last page shows the crash report and citation analysis where it's going to crash on the causeway american bank and then there's a total of 191 combination of citations and warnings issued in the studio any questions from the counseling alex abel uh yes um actually too where was the location of the assault and is this considered an imminent danger of increasing or you know any further danger to our residents no it was not the assault was a passenger in a vehicle the driver of that vehicle was arrested for dui and then the passenger was arrested for both resisting arrest without violence and then once he was being placed in the car he kicked the death penalty thank you any other questions from the council no i i'm pretty sure you just kind of went right over it did you read our code enforcement report also you did not i did not i'm not familiar with that that's that's quite all right i heard citations and i was i jumped right over i'm looking for the citations written in new homeowners all right if there are no other questions sergeant i appreciate it thank you sir thank you very much now we have the code enforcement report is anyone here to present mr reaper mayor and council this is the code report for the month of it june the focus was on permitting and construction permits um a couple of things to know the uh there was a short-term rental that was picked up and also a failing lift [Music] that was noticed it's under docks thank you very all much so

right thank you very much thank you all right next up is the citizens advisory committee thank you mayor council uh ron sagan citizen advisory council we had four meetings this month the citizen advisory council also serves as the audit committee which includes council member into tomorrow what we need is the audit committee so we met to review the preliminary budget with the mayor back on april 12th and then the committee also met june 13th where we reviewed the annual comprehensive financial report draft um we agreed that it properly represented the financial results of the fiscal year in 9 30 21 there were a couple changes to some footnotes that we requested that needed to be done then the citizen advisory council we met on may 10th we reviewed the city manager hiring process the council was engaged to review initial applicants score applicants and we reviewed the score sheet reviewed the timeline with the current city manager and the mayor at that meeting and then on june 13th we met to review and accept the scoring tabulations that we had calculated in that process any questions from the council yes i just want to thank you very much we really appreciate all the due diligence the work uh especially with so many applicants for the city management position so thank you again and please pass on our thanks to the rest of the committee thank you councilman vice mayor you submitted an email to the council with regards to the city manager hiring process and you weren't there to talk about it meaning do you want to recap or i appreciate it i just wanted to express that was my own personal opinion that was not an opinion of the council and we didn't have time to really address and review all of the i believe it was 31 applicants it was a large number you know we scored them but yeah my rep my personal recommendation would be to slow down this is a long-term permanent hire i recommend hiring a recruiting firm to really you know weep through uh and maybe find some other candidates that are out there but we had a handful of candidates that met the scoring tabulations that were put together but having been involved in a hiring process for over 20 years i just think this is time to hire the right person for a long term position again that's my own personal opinion thank you thank you any other questions from the council thank you very much all right next up is parks and records everyone good afternoon tammy levinda chair of the park and record um so for this quarter just a couple of recaps we did have one community event which was the fly me to the moon event very successful it was our first run at having a weather day so we had to move the event from outside to inside we do need to find a better way to let people know that it wasn't cancelled because we did have a good turnout but i think some people kind of saw that we weren't outside and then they left so in the future we're going to try to better communicate the fact that all of our events except for halloween will be in her rain or shine so we will figure out a way to make it go and we're also able to send lynn reeves off with a little retirement farewell at that event so that was nice we have three proposed community events that will be presented to you later in the agenda and so i believe you have the budgets for those and i can answer any questions when we get to that um we will be doing our health and wellness fair january 14th of 2023. last year we had 23 healthcare providers from bay care to publix with their organic line we had dr trevor quick dentists we had just the gamut of health care providers for this coming up here what we would really like to do is find more healthcare providers that actually live in bellow beach so with the help of jody shirley and some other people we were able to find three to five that actually live in bellar beach that serve bigger communities but it'll be on the website early so we're hoping to have more of our residents share their knowledge and their business with our residents so that's coming up january 14th and then let's see okay so for the time being we've suspended the blood drive we've been doing it for over a year and the numbers are kind of dwindling so maybe it's because it's summer and you know people have gone to their other homes but we might look at doing it in the future but for right now we're kind of looking for something to replace that um they do it all the times at publix across the bridge there's lots of places that are close that if you are a die-hard donating blood every time that are close we still aren't having yoga but just in the building because of the heat we're not having it at morgan park just because it's usually very crowded and people are paying for parking so we'll probably bring that back when it gets a little cooler outside something that i didn't know until recently it's not the apartment record but there are um tennis lessons that are there's an instructor and they go through the city so if anybody's interested in that you can call um city hall however i think we're going to add that to the parking report um like list of activities just because it it fits um park and record beach survey we did one since our last corduroy board report and i'm hoping it's going to be on our website on our page where you see what park and red board surveyed and then the outcome and suggested like we have kind of broken down in categories where things that are easy fix for the maintenance people things that are already on like your radar that need to be fixed repaired replaced and things that are kind of like on the wish list down the road so it's not a nice spreadsheet that kyle health has put together so we're hoping to have that on our page as well so people can see what we are working towards getting accomplished our beach cleanups are still continuing every first saturday of the month so i'd like to thank you to all the volunteers that come we really appreciate your help we had a good volunteer like group this holiday weekend so that was great so every first saturday of the month we meet at 19th street at eight o'clock in the morning it's for one hour and then afterwards we have like water and donuts or whatever and then you're out of there by 9 15. so not a bad way to start your saturday bellar beach logo wear so we started this about a year year and a half ago and it's going really really well like as soon as we get some of the things in stock they're sold right away especially if they're tied to the event so we did get some new bellar beach t-shirts and tank tops in stock and they actually have the correct established in 1950 date it took us a while to get that correct um just because our provider wasn't really cooperating but we have hats in stock they should be here anytime the beach towels we've had two sets that sold out but so right now we're working on logoed hand towels so those should be in shortly those will also be listed on our website with the pricing and then there's the bellar beach license plates last time i was up here i mentioned the beller beach community foundation so since that last update in april we have made progress the board has been formed and we are [Music] 75 through the paperwork we are just getting ready to fill out the application for the 501c3 which obviously is the part that takes the longest but so far we are moving right along and i'll continue to update as we make progress and then also if anybody has any suggestions i know you can call city hall my number is all over the website one of our most difficult things that we have and i know it kind of spreads across everything is spreading the word of what we're doing even if it's on the sign in the front of the building or if it's on the website i just think a lot of people still aren't seeing it and you'll see that in one of our proposed events it's going to be the first one of our first events we actually are trying to sell tickets to so we're going to try to we need to get more people to know about it i guess so word of mouth but if anybody has any suggestions we would greatly appreciate it and we do have two board openings right now we have one that you'll vote on later but we also have one after that so i think that's it though does anybody have any questions for me anyone on the council questions what was the event what was the event you were referring to that we need more word america oh um the one oh the chili cook-off in november yeah so we'll be selling tickets to that and it's the first event that we'll have we'll be selling tickets for like beer and wine we've never actually done that at an event so it's a new thing that we're trying because it's kind of always been bring your own if you want but we're going to get all the liability and you'll see that in the spreadsheet with the budget because people have been requesting it like they show up and they ask can i get you know a glass of wine and we just we haven't we haven't done that so far i have to admit i've never heard of chili and wine but hey you know any other council members oh well thank you very much okay thank you all right and the last board report is planning and zoning we have anyone from planning and zoning tonight okay in that case we will move right on to item number seven which is the city attorney's report uh mr trask you have the board thank you um glad to be here i'm coming for randy he's on vacation with his family um he said to pass on he's continuing to transition here at the city and the city attorney he's been working with the city manager on a couple of different items and he'll continue to do that and he's available at any time once so once he gets back into town in the meantime you can contact me if you have anything and i'd be happy to answer any questions if you have any from the secretary's office okay thank you very much any questions from mr trask all right thank you now we move on to the city manager's report mr reaper thank you mayor council we have the upcoming drainage project evaluation of which i am going to have taken care of the video of the pipe uh sometime this month it's kind of time dependent so um scheduled right now for july 22nd could be if we can free up their schedule from there we plan to use those those videos to help design future options for the next stormwater project we have the golf boulevard undergrounding coming up we [Music] currently have the numbers for the phase one of the project i'm in the process of getting together the phase two numbers uh to discuss in the upcoming workshop the total cost with looking at completing phase one or possibly completing both phases and what what the different numbers would be but what uh how that would affect us moving forward we have the seventh street seawall and boat ramp renovation that's tied together with the 16th street seawall renovation that is currently noticed to proceed has been given and we're just waiting on the county to get through the permitting uh that has a start date of july 11th and from there we have the city hall seawall project which would be right up back here to help prevent some of the eroding that's that's occurred over time that currently is the big data to be determined uh funding was uh increased for the 7th street and 16th street sea walls but we had more funding coming into the budget with the uh the upcoming year so that's something to consider moving forward to get that done and then we have the children's playground replacement that's currently on the agenda tonight councilman is there any update for the 12th and 13th street project we got the results back from the 13th street video and i made sure that the engineers had seen that and then they followed up with the recommendation and i had me for that hopefully everyone got that email okay okay is that going forward the project yeah any other questions mike sable yeah mr mayor um i really i really need to point this out um last meeting we had a vote for to approve that project going ahead um some people lost sleep over it but i reviewed the video there was catastrophic failure on one of those pipes as a collapsed pipe in addition to gaps between the bites root intrusions we're going to make the video available to the public so you can review it i believe it's only before the video around a minute of 36 and two when they're saying yeah this pipe collapsed so i just want to let you know that yeah we had a problem the council went out we took care of it started the work on that project and there was a good reason for you know frankly it was gone that's all thank you [Music] um since you brought it up you did vote to go ahead and move forward before the videos were taken so that was a dangerous situation in addition to that i've asked our interim city manager to take a look at what fixes are available out there because there are fixes available for joints that aren't working well where you can repair them from the inside and out and placing the pipe so just to make you aware of that before you step way out there but again we had a collapsed pipe we did have a cloud spot so you can fix one pipe all right gentlemen yeah we'll go thank you mr baker this is this is my requirements at the city council it's about 13 and uh 12 and thursday in the street council meetings why i voted for it but what i wanted to ask the city manager and manager mr drummond got up about the fine on his mother's home is that on your agenda to try to resolve this because i don't understand the whole thing how a balanced check can go from 100 to 29 000 unfortunately we have a three minute time limit for mr drummond i don't think he could express himself the whole 29 29 000 worth um i would like to see a movie job my plan is to review the paperwork he's given and then compare it to what we have on our file and then send it out so that you guys can see all that can we have a lady maybe mr drummond and i with you and go over this when you get when you get everything ready baker uh yep be aware that the city attorney is also looking yes all right any other comments i just had a quick question on the um city hall sea world seaworld project when will you have it just says they could be determined so i know it's off in the future are we proposing that the beach goes away and that we have that all of this sea wall out there is that what you're is that what the proposal is or the drawings look like i don't know i haven't seen it well currently it had some like geo matting and some rip rap and that was supposed to help prevent the erosion when we did the storm water project uh we had some of the machines come over and try to replace the riprap get into the better spot to prevent future erosion but it it is happening with the with the water coming up higher it's slowly eating away the land back there so we had a design of a seawall being installed to be like a permanent fix i mean it's just flown out to the channel and yes you know showing your channel is not as though the sea water is rising it's just a movement of water and so now if we had sea wall that's what i'm trying to find out because we has anyone seen any drawings on the ground just be curious if you could share that with us that would be great yeah we have drawings um so we can sort of project what the cost would be you might need a little bit more money pulled in from what we're buying this year's budget but it could be doable so look at two other business here thank you very much all right we'll move on to item nine which is the city clerk's report mr patrick you have the bar um council uh made their decisions to move forward to contact the candidates and um see if they're still available and offer them the opportunity to apply for the position so that's what we're working on now and then the board of adjustment we're just beginning to start that process which is you know mailings notifying the surrounding residents and getting everything ready for the hearing and that's what i have for now counselor patty uh today was the first day we were gonna contact those candidates i think there were seven how did you make out if we could answer well we haven't started yet yeah but we're going to start tomorrow i'm sorry councilman banker anything else all right we are on to item number 10 we're finally into the consent agenda so this first item is uh approval of the may 16 2022 city council word session minutes and approval of the june 1st 2022 special counsel meeting minute do i have a motion motion to prove the consensus second now we're on to the regular agenda this is item 12. it's consideration of ordinance 20 0-2 mr trask would you please read the summary for us so this is ordinance an ordinance of the city and council of the city of bel air beach florida providing for an amendment to section 30-141 of

to establish the boundaries of vessel exclusion zones in the city's coastal waters providing for several ability providing for the repeal of all witnesses and conflict here with and providing for an effective date that was the first reading of wardens 22.02 by title only thank you mr trask do i have a motion motion on this ordinance okay the motion dies all right so now we are on to agenda item 13. thank you mayor this is resolution 2022.04 resolution the city council of miller beach florida approving the fiscal year 2022-2023 non-abnormal assessment role for the bellevue estates island assessment area directing certification of the assessment role of the pelos county tax collector and providing for an effective date that was the reading of resolution 2022.04 by title only do i have a motion on this resolution 2022.04 um have no comments if you don't turn it over to kyle [Music] this is just a manual requirement of the assessment role to have it certified yes just one question are there any changes [Music] over the previous years um not with any of the pricing we have i believe in one property pay off okay [Music] other council members all right any comments from the citizens all right back to the council uh leslie and taro having the last word no further comments all right we need to uh i think we can just get away with a voice vote or because it's a resolution it needs to be a roll call roll call okay let's do it council member notaro i'm council member roberts aye councilmember shirley yes councilmember zable i'm council member banker yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor goddess aye 7-0 it's unanimous resolution 20 2204 is on the books all right we're moving right along to item number 14. this is consideration of approval for parks and rec ford proposed schedule of events do i have a motion hello joey shirley you have a second second i might say jody you have a floor yeah i think that you know looking at the scheduled events they're timed appropriately the budgets don't seem out of line i like what the park support is doing and i think we should support them in what they're doing thank you very much for the comments yes for the halloween costume contest item dog water bowls description halloween donuts 150 dollars are we paying that much for donuts or are we paying last year we did apple cider and water and donuts but this year because um we couldn't there's a wedding that saturday so we have to move it to the sundance let me interrupt you for one second i think you're there's a typo and she just wants clarification item two on the halloween costume contest it says item is dog water bowls and the description is halloween donuts okay so which one is it both of them made it's not the dog holes okay just curious i don't know that makes sense i am it was revised like 10 times so it was probably just a typo but if you want me like to explain that i will real quick because last year we did a parade which we are not going to do again we are going to do more like a trunk or treat because we definitely needed the time for the judges and all of that so we're going to try to find some volunteers but the city will also have their trunk per se where we're handing out candy so that will kind of cover donuts but also like beverages and dog treats and all of that great any other questions from the council on the holiday social tree lighting i don't know if this i guess this might be more your area kyle we seem to always pull the tree lighting down right after january 1st a lot of towns leave their trees up until the epiphany january 6 can we do something on council by leaving the tree lit until the sixth i think that's not a problem typically just after the holiday we bring it down but we can make everything keep it up that day does that need to go anywhere mr mayor it's it's not even uh it's not not even on this schedule which is there's no hand-date for that that was just uh what the city manager was doing but i don't see any reason why we've been thank you any other questions from the council or comments all right let's take it to the citizens thank you can't answer questions from the citizens all right back to the council the council member uh uh was surely having the last word okay uh this one i believe we can do a voice vote all in favor uh any opposed all right it looks like we've got three events in the near future now we are on to item 15. this is a consideration of appointment to the board of adjustments a person's name is david gardella before we begin do i have a motion motion acceptation secreted by terry shirley i think you have the floor i believe his application for appointment speaks violence and i believe we should move away any other questions from the council or comments no it's mr gardella here mr dardella would you like to come and address the council good evening council david cardella 705 harbor drive i also happen to be the fire commissioner for bellary beach so just if you have any questions during this run up to the chief's plans for the referendum let me know but i like to volunteer my time and effort for the board of adjustments i understand we just meet when there's a variance application and i like the fact that peller beach for the board of adjustments you make a decision yay or nay for the application and that's the final final decision for the city i know our neighbor down the street in the iraq's they got a board of adjustment uh committee they vote on something they can approve it 5-0 but the council can vote the next month and deny it so i like the fact that the board of adjustments here sir studied at issue in this final vote so looking forward to helping out being available thank you very much uh well if you or anyone have you have any questions for mr vardo uh bless meredith i just have a question regarding the constraints for i know the charter talks about load of adjustment and not being able to sit on other boards or committees i just want to make sure that there's nothing there to prevent the fire so you're asking because he's a fire commissioner for the panelist county or the the fire district yeah i just want to make sure there's no conflict i you know i i personally have no problem with it i just want us to become an issue there is no conflict the question comes in is a dual office holding so i think that we probably should take a look at that um i don't know the answer off the top because i need to look at their charter i'm not really that familiar with it i need to look at your charter and your code too so you can approve it subject to the city attorney's review of it and then if we find that it's a it's appropriate for evidence or the dual um office prohibition then we can bring that back to you and let you know that and you're going to appoint somebody else but let us let us research that is the dual officer any other council comments wouldn't he just be able to resign from his other one i want to make sure that there is no violation first because there's no violation you would need to resign i will add that i did go through the code and i i'm not an attorney nor do i stay in a holiday inn express but um i didn't see any conflict however i did not look at the pinellas suncoast fire district so there could there may be a conflict there but in any case i think that this would be just pending final legal review if we go to a preview and then uh and then once we get to go ahead from our attorney then we'll just move right forward that would that make me available for i guess there's a scheduled meeting on the board of adjustments for august i believe we can certainly get you approved between now and august okay i don't think that there would be a problem there um does anyone have any other questions for mr gardella no thank you [Music] do we have any citizens that would like to speak i'm mike kelly and i just came up here to endorse david's application david's credentials i've known david personally for over 30 years he's a very committed person he's a man of conviction he'd be an excellent addition to our award thank you in addition to your comment mr mayor you and i both talked about the way that our charter is written and we see no conflict because the fire district is basically a county situation it is not a city board as a result we suggest that mr gardella's nomination be approved we do not see any conflict whatsoever thank you thank you very much uh we'll we will still have to wait until we get final approval but i think this is something that can happen in a day i don't know sexy yes okay thank you very much okay so uh any other citizen comments no all right let's bring it back to the council no comments do you want to bend that motion yes we someone would need to do that thank you so much for calling that out so i i moved to amend the current motion to consideration of the appointment of david gardella to the board of adjustment pending review and approval by the okay so you're making a motion to alter it to where it's consideration of appointment to the board of adjustments david gardella pending legal review yes sir do i have a second elimination second i'm confused i mean if if we vote for this and then the city attorney says it's cool do we have to do it anything else no okay but but we still have to we have to vote to amend it and then we have to vote on the unmanned motion okay so uh did i have a second on that motion jody shirley all in favor aye aye that's to amend all right so now we're back to the original motion this is consideration of appointment to the board of adjustments of david gardella pending legal review hey uh let's see peggy would you please call councilmember notaro councilmember roberts yes councilmember shirley aye council members abel yes councilmember banker yes vice mayor gunn i'm mayor goddess hi so it's unanimous and um pending congratulations and thank you for volunteering [Music] all right we're on to item number 16. this is consideration of appointment of an alternate member of the citizens advisory committee the nomination is for dr brian g biller do i have a motion point do i have a second second is that mike sable yes basically you have the floor i think as i said the resume speaks for itself a good addition any other council comments nope all right uh is dr killer here dr dillard was not able to thank you would any of the citizens like to speak on behalf of dr dillard nope last chance for comments all right let's bring it back to the council with leslie nataro having a laugh just add a couple things his resume is quite impressive i agree um he's not a registered voter in the city and i know we have some restrictions on council positions regarding registered voters but where are we for is it that you have n a does that mean he's we're not the information's not available or he's not a voter what does that mean patty a committee member does not have to be a registered voter only a board member i understand that's in our code right it just brings to question when we have the advisory committee you know i kind of put a high level of faith in and if they're not registered voter i'm not sure how that affects our citizens right i understand i'm going to go a little further on that the resume looks great however if he's not a registered voter here that probably means he's he is homestead somewhere else which means the majority of time is living outside of the city of bel air beach now it could be wrong this is all speculative but if it happens to be a snowbird and the greater percentage of the year is not here even though this is not a standard board this is one of our committees we put together i believe that this is one of our most important committees we have because they do the hard work and they meet often so um just america i make a motion to table this to bring him in we discuss this he might he may have registered today for all that's what i'm saying frank banker is making a motion do we have a second second that's mike sable uh we're gonna have to do this by roll call you can do it by the voice though you can do it by voting voicemail all right well all in favor all right so that's five to two and the motion is table all right let's move on to item number 17. this is for consideration of appointments to the park and recreation board of one regular member and one alternate member there are currently two members the first is patty roberts who is currently an alternate member and the second is deborah de cosimo who is a new applicant this is to fill the vacancy of one person on a five-member board and one of the two vacancies for alternates there are currently only four well that's right now there are currently only four board members and this board does not or has one alternate names are listed in the order their applications were received the first was patty roberts the second most ever to hospital so before we begin do i have a motion for this consideration [Music] we need the specifics on the motion is it a motion to point patty roberts as the full-time board member endeavor as the alternate or vice versa this a motion to i'm sorry my motion is to open up for discussion of the vote of the two candidates possible two candidates okay generally what we do is we pass out a piece of paper it'll have it'll have the two candidates and the two positions and the the council will vote which which uh way that each person should be should represent that particular board okay i understand that and then so we all know then that you need to not only pick the person but you also need to sign that ballot yes and so the city clerk can take that down okay correct yes that's fine okay would you like to repeat that one more time this is a the motion is to open up discussion for the two applicants applying for the parts of rex board and to vote thereafter very much do i have a second thank you second my mind to vote robertson all right any discussion oh all right uh is miss roberts here okay how about mr cosman is he here so neither uh candidate is here all right let's take it to the citizens any citizens would you like to make a comment concerning this uh these forest assignments all right back to the council the comments all right penny would you please pass out the balance thank you thank [Music] [Music] sorry oh councilmember banker voted for mr cosimo as the alternate and ms roberts as the member council member notaro voted for miss decosimo as an alternate and ms roberts as a member councilmember roberts voted for miss decosimo as the alternate and miss roberts as the member mayor gattis voted for miss de cosimo as an alternate and miss roberts as a mem as a member vice mayor gunn voted for miss cosmo as the member and ms roberts as the alternate councilmember shirley voted for miss decosimo as a member and ms roberts as the alternate and council members abel voted for mr cosimo as alternate and ms roberts as a member okay so uh it looks like miss roberts becomes the full member at five to two and uh biscuit cosimo becomes the alternate at five to two congratulations to both both volunteers we really appreciate their service and i'm sorry that either one's here to be congratulated i get dinner tonight so that's good i said and i get dinner tonight [Music] all these nights that is special all right we're up to number 18 and this is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for law enforcement services with the pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2022-23 before we begin do i have [Music] and you can't motion the table until we get to the second does anyone have anyone like to wait a second on this one second second by jimmy shirley all right mr banker do you have the floor yes i still believe the memorandum speaks for itself uh and we should move forward with this i don't know considering that's like right i think other comments from would you say this is one of our largest expenses in the city but the service provided we've been very pleased with the space this is a 5.18 increase it seems within the realm of what's going on in the economy today i think it's still a good deal 62 dollars an hour if you figure 365 that's that's pretty neat the first thing with their skill set as well as the vehicle [Music] yeah i have to tell you i have no problem with your comments um and i'm approaching this strictly former contracts officer the reason i brought that up is i used to work for the navy inspector general ferrado and follow up as a deputy director and we are very concerned about something called an anti-deficiency act that's where you're spending money that you do not have yet and that includes money and projected budgets going through the contract you're using 2223 funds we have not approved that budget that budget does not get approved for at least another month and a half the council is currently considering changes to not only perhaps the sheriff but also to the code enforcement signing a contract now one is kind of reaching the energy deficiency because we're spending money that we do not have in-house two it locks the committee into approving regardless of what we see in the budget we may have to cut back we're required by law to have a balanced budget and again i'm talking just strictly you know i could be totally wrong but i'm coming at this strictly legal the problem is the timing of this contract it should not be signed while we are considering the budget from which it is funded this should be gapped or signed an extension so that we sign this contract with money in the bank and that the council has fully understood and signed up for the obligations in that contract and we can only do that after the complete discussions of the budget so i mean you don't cover the problem not a solution my solution would be to contact the sheriff's extend the contract until it starts october 1st i would say until after we get a final budget once we have the final budget and the money is in the bank basically after the first we can then legally commit the city to that contract that was the reason for it it's not for the services it's just that i have to make you understand from my perspective legally in government you can't spend money that you do not have and we do not have that until october first that's all well one second mr riepler is it my understanding am i correct that we can alter the amount of services that we contract with pinellas county sheriff or is it a flat rate done deal and we can't change it ever we can alter services on both law enforcement haven't occurred i thought that that was sort of on the fly we could we could raise or lower those services at any time based upon our needs and also our budgeting yeah i know for a fact that in the code enforcement it says the hours um discussed or agreed to it i think the city manager but trying to find it in the law enforcement contractors this is paragraph number five of the agreement how are the city of direct services that you need i also bring your attention that the contract doesn't start until october the 1st and you'll also have 120-day termination provision in it also you can terminate it with 120 days notice so this doesn't lock you in uh for any period of time greater than that but that paragraph five says uh the sheriff or his design shall confer with the city regarding law enforcement problems within the city and it shall accept the city of general policy direction how the law enforcement services are delivered into the left portion of the municipality a particular type of level of service should be delivered to counteract law enforcement problems within the city and it goes on so you have a couple of different things there that will address that thank you that's exactly what i was looking for vice mayor i was just going to say that's a good catch i understand exactly where it comes from my background government-wise and so the approval of this is this something we're just doing to get off our plate right now or maybe is there a timetable trying to keep your sheriff's office i mean is this something we could amend and once again just final review the budget process and improve the budget and yeah i believe that it's something we can amend i will double check just to make sure the thing is though i mean i'll just say this is that we um different than many uh government contracts i'm sure you guys are waiting for funding from a higher government source and the situation the taxes are guaranteed sort of funding we're not in the same situation as you would be in a contracting position in the military i disagree this is a case where you're a government entity and you cannot spend legally money that you do not have and be able to agree to the money or the way in which you'll spend it yet we couldn't agree to any contract then because the money comes in over a period of time no there's not i mean i mean that you know thinking of from that standpoint i'm just looking at it going okay well we don't get just because we have these actual taxes we don't get payment on when they pass in september october they're paying all the time yeah in government contracting it's very specific we're talking about the fiscal year you can't touch any money until october first of that year so you do not have that money we cannot and yet we cannot enter into a contract with nothing in the bank you can't write a blank check which is what we would be doing to the sheriff's department i just want to make sure that we finish the budget that we agreed on the level of services going in so we can negotiate the best rates but then we can enter onto a contract after the beginning or just prior to the beginning of the fiscal year knowing that when we write that check that eleven thousand dollars a month it's a half month contract that we have that money in the bank legally i think mr zabal of the vice mayor has it i just want to say that the anti-deficiency aspect anything aside let's just give this thing the sanity check that is you're proving our our largest line item in the budget before we even had the final review so from the common sense perspective i would say aside from the anti-deficiency question you think let's wait i mean what's what's the hurry in this thing this is our biggest line item in our budget so far as expenses go we haven't even had that meeting and we're already approving that budget now so was there a deadline that often shot sometimes um paragraph six of the agreement says the obligation for monetary payments called to be made here under shall be deemed to exist for less than a year at any point in time and shall be entirely subject to the legislative budgetary discretion of the city so there's really no conflict between citing it now before our budget is approved this is on page 6 of 12. so this just defies let's yeah let's write a check for something we haven't even discussed whether or not what's in our bank account or what our other expenses are so it just does it defies my my uh my sense of what are we acting responsibly for the citizens and being the stewards of their budget i i say let's go through the budget process that we were supposed to do this thing and then sign the checks figured out what what we have in our banking jobs thank is this rate locked in if we don't improve this tonight um i believe it is but i'm going to check everything on that because if it's not where i in this could escalate and uh it is it's eleven thousand dollars a month it's not a great check of 539 tonight and we do have a reserve button so i don't believe it we violate or avoid fiscal responsibilities all right let's let's go to the citizens would anyone like to comment on this okay back to the council one more time yes can i just say in the past i know we've had some conflicts like this when we weren't certain and we just took a step back and we've had the sheriff come in and talk to us about the contract yes we discussed additional hours we discussed taking you know pulling back some deputies adding deputies he gave us some flexibility he was very candid about talking to us about everything in the contract we had questions on and so i you know i would almost propose that we maybe go that fast you know just look at that but i don't want to i'm going to offer another something else to vote on right now so everyone has a chance to speak but just thinking down that back vice mayor yeah i guess i get a little frustrated when i keep hearing the term we have reserved funds we just watched the pinellas fire department show us a slide they've been astute enough to forecast five years ahead and even 20 years ahead and we have never done that we talk we keep talking about reserve funds and never once have we projected our expenses and our revenues past the next year to fee to see what's happening to our reserves what's the burn rate of our our reserves when do we run out of that reserve we've never done that so i'm kind of frustrated and i'm i admire the pinellas fire county for doing their homework we have yet to sit down and do that ourselves well we have a strategic plan that mentions what safety about six or eight times in it and when was that review that's correct okay so you're saying that we shouldn't look into safety and cut the sheriff out so everyone here with the price of ammo going up your goat should go home and lock and load i mean we're not going to cut the sheriff's budget okay we're not going to negotiate unless we cut back on manpower now if you want to put the citizens at risk do what you want to do okay take witness all right but these guys 62 bucks an hour you'll work too cheap in my opinion all right you're well worth every time we pay anymore no no one is disputing the cost yes you are nobody is feeding the lion it's the protocol and the chronology and timeline of doing it the right way let's start doing things the right way instead of just shooting from the hip saying we've got money in the reserves i think you will get to the exact same point and the exact same cost but we are going to do it right just like a government official would do okay drag it right through the mud and come up with the same results thank you because we're being responsible right now that's not going to respond to being irresponsible point of order brandon okay i think that we've uh talked about this enough uh for now uh we either need to table this or we need to vote on it we're at the table until we reviewed the budget process okay i hear a motion to take so i have a second second the motion to table all right so now we must take a vote on the motion to table um let's just go ahead and do this on a roll call please council member banker no council member notaro no councilmember roberts no councilmember shirley aye councilmember sable yes vice mayor gunn i detained mayor no so we're back to voting on this okay uh so here we go let's take a roll call vote on approving this uh contract do you need to bring it back to citizens mr mayor just just followed your procedure here we did uh all we did was loaded a table and stopped we're right back to the original motion is that correct that's correct okay so now we're to the vote ready council members able yes council member shirley no councilmember roberts yes councilmember noterow yes councilmember banker yes vice mayor gunn name yes so the motion passes five to two and mr roofer you may proceed with that contract all right we're on to item number 19 which is to authorize the interim city manager to execute the contract for code enforcement services with a pinellas county sheriff for fiscal year 2022 2022-23 before again do i have a motion lastly do i have a second [Music] um contract with the sheriff's i think we should um do this for the same reason other comments from the council vice mayor this contract is laid aboard time huh so let me look at that the reason i ask is because there's been discussion in the work sessions and at previous meetings about whether or not we were going to review how we were going to do this and create a hybrid or not and when i work the numbers we're still at 20 hours a week so i'm just wondering if this thing is amendable ending the teacher discussion or consideration so paragraph six of this contract says the sheriff will provide one part-time community policing deputy code enforcement which will be provided as on as needed basis the specific hours of work of this community policing department shall be determined by his or her supervisor after consultation with the city manager the community policing deputy will investigate and take enforcement actions for violation of the city's covered awardances we'll track and prepare statistical reports for the city concerning the numbers and types of violations issued on a monthly basis interact with both decisions and businesses to address and resolve co-violation-related issues and i would also bring your attention that unlike the previous agreement a 120-day termination requirement this is only 60. so it's a large smaller window but you have the ability to terminate this agreement a lot of comments from the council yeah i'd like to just add that again it's one of those items we discussed in a work session it was brought to us by city manager that they wanted to consider reorganizing how we're handling code yet we've got a contract in front of us to hire the sheriff's department to handle code we didn't address the items we discussed in a work session we're right back to contradicting you know what i'm not sure where we have a work session and we're not going to follow what we discuss in the work session and we bring it in front of the council to vote on other comments from the council well i think just to reiterate again um that the um our legal counsel just read it is amendable so at any time the city manager could name it the sheriff and say we want the hours to be x which include including 20 to zero if we wanted to bring somebody internally on today is july 5th and the contract isn't up until the end of september just we have a window to discuss that and decide how we want to proceed which is about as far as this goes this particular contract or is there a specific i don't i think that they give us the opportunity to alter it one direction or the other rapidly it's my understanding and i've spoken with sheriff well terry about this before and he said he would do whatever it took to make sure that we were satisfied with those services and if it's too much or too little he's willing to be flexible at work with us um just like the contract says it may be 60 days instead of 120 but it's still i think maybe the reason why we're getting ahead of this is to announce our intentions that we want to continue to engage with the sheriff's department i could be wrong but this is probably giving them time to plan just like it's giving us time to plan uh but the last thing that i would do is them to not have the manpower to service us because we delayed it um either way i think that we could probably because it's a shorter running contract we could delay this vote if the council sees so and then talk about it after the next work session it's i'll leave that up to the council uh before i get to the citizens do we have any other comments from the council yes mr toronto i just noticed i should have seen this before on page 406 it says notice shall be given to lynn reeves city manager that that should probably be altered yeah just city manager period if i have to make a motion to amend or descend interim city manager i think it's something that we can correct the typographical area will be corrected the motion as you currently have is sufficient okay any other council comments before i take it to the citizens citizens any comments nope all right let's bring it back to the council and wesley taro has the last word on it okay uh hey i think we're going to do another roll call vote on this council member banker yes councilmember notaro yes councilmember roberts yes councilmember shirley no councilmember sable no vice mayor gunn nay mayor goddess no so the motion fails four to three and we're moving right on to item number 20. this is to authorize the interim city manager to execute a purchase order for the replacement of bayside park play structure do i have a motion move to operation and do i have a second second is that mike sable yes satori you had before i think this looks like a definite proper addition to our park out there and i think it would be great i wish i had little kids to play [Music] board i didn't follow all their discussion was this one of the recommendations that they proposed funding this playground equipment i mean it seems to me they're the parts direct people does this have their full support and if so they have a budget are they stakeholders and are they willing to chip in and make a contribution to this equipment mr reaper it was part of their recommendations to replace the playground in their surveys that they did in the parks and then i in the meeting i told them that the next step would be to propose it to the council for the replacement at the very least um we have to do something about the current playground so do they feel strongly enough to obligate some of their budget towards this equipment i'd have to go back and ask them most of the table until we have some feedback from the parking record all right we have a motion a table do we have a second second second jimmy shirley uh let's take a vote on this one can we make a comment on the motion details [Music] councilmember baker no councilmember notaro no councilmember roberts no councilmember shirley yes councilmember stable vice mayor gunn aye mayor gavis no so the motion of the table fails and we are right back to the discussion do we have any other comments from the council right now yes mr carr in the memorandum it says the funding is available in the 2122 capital projects budget so it's not like we're using next year's money or that the money is not there it's in the budget thank you for bringing that up and that was going to be my next comment do we have any other comments right now that was going to be one of my questions is it actually budgeted or is it just accessing the funding i'm trying to understand is this something that previous council budgeted for its budget in the capital projects um for the bayside park master plan so it's improvements towards the park i just find it interesting when we go we have no kids but let's let's vote to spend fourteen thousand dollars i'm going to challenge that we do have kids they just don't live on your street and i would i would rather them be here in this park than running up and down the street because we still do have a little bit of a speeding problem and this is a great place for them to come and burn off some energy if there was something for them to do out there and then just make note this the structures for age two to five so if they're running in the street and it's probably a bigger problem than um you are correct and and i am the first one that would use this i have now four grandchildren we would use them all under the age of five but i don't want to spend fifteen thousand dollars on the city's money entertaining my grandchildren that don't live here in the city and that's and so i'm just trying to be realistic to make sure one do we have you know we're still budgeting we're still talking about plant you know all these unfinished utility projects there's so many things on the table is a play set for two to five year old top priority so so i'm gonna challenge you on that um that budget was approved and the money was set aside for that park is that correct currently we have 56 640 dollars prior to your funding so we for some reason we voted to approve a budget for that part but what else are we going to do with it i think there was a big plan a big master plan for the entire park am [Music] since then there has not been a plan per se that plan failed because it was asking for way more money than we would ever be willing to budget for that part so even though they were willing to give us money we had to meet them dollar for dollar and we did not have it we were trying to figure out how to cut corners and save our money and uh i think that this is a compromise compared to what what we were originally talking about uh now that funding does it also include what's going on with the seawall out here no that's never completely separate okay i don't have any more comments right now anyone else before i go to the citizens the current condition of that equipment out here now is it dangerous it's at the point where it needs to be removed so at the very least i think i'd like approval to remove the moles what's existing nobody gets hurt it has no replacement parts available it's uh the plastic itself is deteriorating and the slide is holding it i agree with a council member about spending fifteen thousand dollars on entertaining kids i mean i i have a hard time with that but if you're going to have a park you have a park so like stuck in the middle here my kid grandkids go over there and play i noticed it is deteriorating pretty rapidly any other comments we went through one iteration just a couple of years ago where we yellow taped off the area did we replace anything equipment or get this removed so that it really we attempted to repair the slide and it broke against that side what's the average lifespan on this hardware i have to check with the manufacturer but they they told me it was past his full life i don't i didn't get the exact date it's 20 plus years now did they take florida sun into consideration or is it in shade over there uh well it's in chase but it has its own challenges with the uh the branches and the moisture and all that but okay let's take it to the citizens right quick and uh and then we'll dial it back in up here and take a vote come on guys all right back to the council councilmember roberts yes council member notaro yes councilmember shirley no councilmember banker council members able yes vice mayor gun name mayor guys yes so it passes five to two that's the reason where you may proceed with the playground equipment all right we are now on to unfinished business council all right we have no unfinished business we're on to item 22 which is council conference uh this month we go in reverse alphabetical order so we will start with council members okay time you start with me first um actually you don't want to waste your time enjoy your evening that's all i have thank you next up uh councilmember shirley yeah i don't have much more to say i was nice to see the seats full of shame everyone left the meeting but thanks for coming out participating thank you mr roberts nothing additional all right council member nataro um yes in regard to all the people that were out here before those were all condo people from the beach who were here to talk about the buoy thing and i was reading in last week's um or bellar or beach feed whatever it is that indian rocks is having this any rex beaches having the same issues with their buoys and stuff and i think we should it would benefit us to work with the other communities along the beach to get together you know we've got the big c meeting here at the end of july right patty yes you know we should put it on the agenda then on that agenda and discuss it and have our our city manager and our city attorney work with the official their comparable officials from the other cities and see if we can get together and come up with a workable solution other than the voting zones and swimming zones and stuff maybe if we do that together we can have some influence on the guys up in tallahassee who are messing with the buoys thank you very much my question is did any rocks did they just pop up on the radar or is this are they just getting caught up in our development [Music] i don't have actual information on what happened with that i couldn't get that i could answer that question it says um in april of this year we were notified by the fish and wildlife commission that our buoy system may not be in compliance with new state statutes and that's exactly what happened to us so the new state statutes have affected all of the preached communities i have to correct you here okay they're not new state statutes it was passed by the legislation in 2009 went into effect in 2010. i talked to mr moore that there is a workable solution here under 327.46 of the statute 1a under the ordinance to stop someone from speaking it actually has to be dealt with and uh as far as i'm concerned your point of order right now because you didn't let her finish her thoughts so we can continue with his point of order or we can uh drop it and let this car finish speaking and then you will be next he can make his comments in his opportunities my point is that things have changed in the last just this year everyone got these notifications saying that our buoy systems were were not in compliance so i think it would help if we were to get together as all the beach communities to discuss what we want to do maybe you know like the strength and numbers thing that we can all we can all work together and see what we can do to improve the situation slash corrected whatever you want to call it so that's my comments and my counsel comments thank you very much mr baker europe okay um i'll get back to that later but uh i'm going to talk about the comments that were made about the 13th and 12th street project so if you don't live on 12th and 13th street we have flooding problems you may want to listen to this not i don't mean to waste your time but last month a few council members commented on why they felt the 12 to 13th street project should have not been voted to proceed i will i was one that did vote for the project and would like to express the reasons why at the word session in may 16 and discussing moving forward with the project the engineer stated that the pipes were 73 years old and at least one failure he further noted previous repairs and a couple depressions in the street he further stated repeatedly it was time to replace these pipes and projects should move forward the former city manager stated that during videoing of the pipes a couple of joints had failures the engineer further stated that the condition of asphalt power can be reworked but five years from now to be questionable the mayor asked about joints that are broken and how to repair and the engineer said that wrapping the system to the joints could be the temporary solution but noted not a fix hence most probably less than a three to five year fix the city manager was also asked about exploring and going into repair mode the city manager at the time was clear that we would be gambling by doing this but we should at least replace all the inlets and there's six of them one council person when asked about going forward with this project said she was against putting a band-aid on this and it should be moved forward last month during council comments a council member said he called it an engineer and was told that this project would not cure the problem although citizens and the city manager stated that since the check valves were installed on 12th and 13th street it was it has made a real difference let's be clear replacing the pipes was never ever mentioned or presumed that this would cure flooding as has been the case on previous stormwater repairs in the city the question before council was should we move forward in replacing the current price which we knew had coupling failures and collapsed pipes simply to restore to the north for the lord i went out and looked at the drains and inlets there are six on this project and some were so poorly deteriorated that the grading and concrete had collapsed into the drain there are further total six coupons or previous sticks on this project between the two streets and at least 40 feet of patchwork near the miami drainage curve we further have a high water table when these pipes fail generally when pipes fail underneath it washes away the bedding and causes stress on each connecting pipe simply who knows what densification compaction of the pipes east and west of each coupling failure is until they start excavation it should be further noted that concrete pipes have steel reborn for strength concrete contains an alkaline environment that provides some protection against corrosion when the pipes are poured and manufactured the steel inside the concrete that is used for reinforcement will react with a factor which these pipes will experience for probably about 70 70 years plus the problem is these pipes are in salt water every day just a hairline crack will can get into the breed bar and deteriorate every day these pipes have sea water coming in to some degree when i noted to the engineer in may work session that my belief is the only way to cure flooding problems is by inserting pumps and possibly one catch basin for every two streets that suggested was returned with pumps or costly and no place to place the catch basin no a cash basis could be placed underground at one end of each any street and use two streets to do the basin the bottom line should we allow 70 plus year old pipes which has separations compression failures along with drain inlets deteriorations to be one council one council person's note to have a band-aid put on it and not go forward with the proceeding with this project coming from the construction field abandoning the problem has truly never worked in my 30-plus years experience especially with piping that is 70 plus years old with no numerous problems again i've seen a huge huge huge difference in life expectancy of pipes from freshwater and solar so the question again before council could some of these fights last another 20 or 30 years i don't believe that council members we should be gambling with the taxpayers money we must know that eight percent of the bid on that 12th and 13th street like any bid is portability and moving equipment in and out if that job got done and another failure happened another eight to ten percent of course would be occurred to this council by just moving an equipment to do another repair i for one think that was a good move to pass and move forward with this project thank you vice mayor gunn in light of uh i've got a couple points i'd like to make best practices is one of them this this agenda it seems to me we excelled a little bit on this we made some improvements in the readability of this thing by giving little snippets of what was entailed in that line item in other words we used to say who who submitted this agenda item and then there would be a sentence to saying what the gist of this agenda was i mean if we talk about approving the sheriff's contract why why couldn't we just throw out there hey it's a 549 thousand dollar total it's gone up 5.18 and it includes a credit for miller shores i mean little snippets like that the playground equipment fourteen thousand two hundred and four we're piggybacking onto a manatee county contract and the existing equipment has passed it's useful serviceable life i i think we need to get back in that habit and why i say that is because it would be nice if this agenda would be a little bit more self-sufficient in this sustained document instead of saying okay there's a bunch now i need to go dig in the back of this tokyo phone book and try to figure out what those numbers are when we've got a lot of busy people up here and it would be the readability and it would be a time savings for everybody in other words when you write this agenda think of it in terms of the way we're going to look at it where we're going to read it i you guys have you deal with those issues all day long but if it just took an extra couple of minutes to add another line or two it would immensely improve the the quality of life of the people sitting up here so that's one issue uh i saw the fire department stand there and show us a five-year projection looking down the road of revenues expenses and the bird rate of their their observed funds we have yet to do that and i think it's finally about time again and i'm starting i want to harp one more time on there's a protocol this to all this stuff and there's a logical sequence to doing this stuff i think we will probably get to the same point and hey i had a huge input to that uh strategic plan you've got several council members sitting up here who wrote that thing and put it in service so we know that thing inside and out so i mean again there's a logical sequence and this is a family plan the strategic plan is tied to the budget process it's tied to a lot of different things and we need to make sure that everybody is baseline on everything so we're making decisions based on common perceptions of what's going on around all this stuff code enforcement stance there's about 45 line items in the existing code report 12 of those line items are reported as complaints from the residents now what's significant about that the significance of that is that all those other lineups were caught by our code enforcement person driving around making objective decisions about what he should do what's important at that time the importance of a complaint from a resident is it's analogous to a direct feedback from our residents about what they consider to be the code enforcement issues of the day what are their priorities in airport what do is it landscaping is it trash is it people parking on the on the street i don't know the the issue i'm trying to raise here is if you look under those complaints there's 12 of those and just about half of them don't give any explanation of what the complaint was there's such things as a possible ordinance violation no violation noted no violation noted and uh there was one other one neighbor complaint it's not giving us the information we need to say what's important to the residents and what should we be focusing on in the code enforcement process that's one thing item last coming from a background where awards citations and presentations happen all the time i would volunteer that perhaps it's it's a it's benefiting when the mayor as the head of the city makes the presentation stuff but perhaps leave behind the citation or the letter you would like to read and i'd be happy to or any other council member can we so everybody can hear what's going on and then you're down there for another opportunity that's just a suggestion coming from my background thank you that's all i have thank you for the constructive criticism i i will accept it gracefully thank you very much uh all right so uh i just like to i want everyone to know that we appreciate the phone calls and emails i hate that most of the condo owners that were here to speak didn't hang around but but i guess that's because we did our job it also means that they did their job just so you know buoys may be important to someone in our city i'm not sure who those are who those people are because i never received one email not one phone call not a single yay i won't louise message or contact whatsoever so the citizens did exactly what they're supposed to do is reach out read the agenda see what's coming up and contact us if you feel strongly about something just i just mainly want you to know that yes the system does work but you have to be engaged you have to reach out to us otherwise just like code enforcement the vice mayor just brought up we don't really know what what's on your mind unless you're willing to actually do something about it and unfortunately with the way that the code laws read now you if you're going to file a complaint it goes on record but if you feel strong enough about something we do it all the time we vote on things and sometimes it goes a way that you'll like and other times it'll go away that you don't like but it's it's part of our beautiful city and it's a responsibility that we should not take lightly so also issues that are being brought up they may not be addressed super fast right now we have a lot on our plate we're trying to hire city manager we're trying to balance the budget we're going to be looking at the strategic plan and i can count right now at least five various important complaints that are coming from around the city that we're going to have to address and a lot of it will be challenging our existing code or at least making sure that what we have is legal and we can enforce it all these things take time and i just all i ask is everyone please be patient with us while we get through this trying time and uh and it'll be a little quieter next year um other than that i'd like to thank everyone for coming tonight uh and also did we ever have anyone that zoomed in this time you have somebody online right now no no five people are watching this meeting well that's that is great and uh again i would like to congratulate mr riefler great job [Music] this is awesome because that's five more people that wouldn't be at this meeting so that's great all right other than that i would like a motion to uh adjourn oh frank baker do we have a second all right lloyd roberts all in favor aye aye opposed goodnight everyone"
