    "transcript": "good evening everyone and welcome to the Monday January 23rd 2023 city council work session of the city of Bellaire Beach please rise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance just Patty would you please call the role council member Frank Banker president council member Belinda Livingstone president councilmember Leslie Notaro here council member Lloyd Roberts president council member Mike zabel mayor Dave Gaddis your city manager Kyle riesler here City attorney Randy Mora president and vice mayor Jody Shirley has not yet arrived thank you very much Patty um before we begin I would like to uh set a time limit on the meeting for no later than 9 pm here in these work sessions three hours were all burned out we're just ready to get out of there so uh we have uh even though there's only uh six mentioned agenda items they're pretty aggressive uh I figure by the time nine o'clock rolls around we'll be ready for a break uh also if anyone needs a break between now and 9 00 PM please just let me know all right uh with that being said let's just move right over to item number one which is discussion of proposed ordinance regarding comprehensive sign regulations this was placed on the agenda by City attorney more foreign thank you Mr Mayor this was brought back to this Workshop not because of any action taken by the office of the City attorney but in the spirit of continuing um the stated goal of revising your sign code some months ago this was presented to you with some introduction uh though it is admittedly lengthy and the council requested more time to digest it determine if it had feedback as there was this was generated sort of as a top-down approach when you folks had interviewed my firm and other firms and Upon Our being hired it was communicated that revisiting your sign code to make it compliant with the following the Supreme Court year of students and jurisprudence and Reed V Gilbert in other cases on that this was a priority and so we prioritized it accordingly and provided a draft absent direct input or guidance on what you were looking to address or what issues might exist in your community our firm has done this for a few communities in Pinellas County and we used not I would not say a a cookie cutter template but one designed to your community based on previous drafts at this stage it was brought back with hopes that there may be some guidance and Direction um ultimately you five a six seven well at any given time but the this Council are the policy makers I will tell you what legally we need to change legally what you cannot do is treat temporary speech in a content-based manner ordinarily that may that made sense to us where we said okay we can't say if you're Pro this issue you get a bigger sign or a smaller sign uh but in the mid teens around 2015 or 2016 there was a Supreme Court case that said oh no no no when you characterize a temporary sign by its content election signs for example non-commercial directional signs this way to the church this way to the 5K um you know come join our our Fest our Festival those are also content-based restrictions and you can't do that and so the it fundamentally upended how a lot of signed codes were written in the in the United States and in fact the dissent in that case made that very clear that this is going to mean fundamentally changing most local regulations on signs and so that's what this reflects the way most communities have adapted to that is to have restrictions based on size number Etc with the understanding that if you limit the number of temporary uh temporary non-commercial signs that extends to what we mean for your campaign signs in a year where you have excuse me a presidential election a local election a ballot measure if you're saying you only get three temporary signs you're capping it so understanding what that means big picture and so ultimately we've gone through we've harmonized this with the way your code is presently laid out and we welcome any input feedback you may have um absent additional in addition to any line edits or concerns you may have about the draft excuse me in addition to any uh line concern line edits or concerns you may have about the draft I wish to underscore again that the seven of you are the policy makers uh as I said in a memo to another Community recently you are free to accept reject add to delete from modify amend what is before you this is given to you for the purpose of simulating a substantive discussion on the issue and allowing you to move forward on the process from here if you do approve It ultimately your planning a zoning board we'll have to look at this as it will mean a change in the Land Development regulations and it would come before you on a first and second reading as you all well know at this point we're not changing the rules tonight we're just trying to get a product that will ultimately get us there thank you very much um Patty please make a note 604 yes vice mayor Shirley arrived um so I went through this Mr Mora and uh I've I've assume that everywhere there's yellow marking that is where it's up to the council to sort of decide are you is this an acceptable number would you like it higher would you like it or what would you like to do so uh to expedite this process uh overall it's way too much information obviously but from a legal perspective I'm sure it has to be this way because there are so many legal loopholes so um so what I would like to ask you to do is um everywhere there's one of these yellow highlights can we just jump to it you give a quick uh explanation for it and what it is you're looking for and then we'll go around the council and we'll try to knock these out sure and that's that is a mostly a very accurate reflection this was the the yellow highlights as policy makers were to highlight this is where you're one where your regulatory ability on this is highest right I want to make sure you see that numbers were not put in there by legal you know say oh well it was it used to be 15 feet but you know legal said it had to be 17. no that's totally you folks and if we used some numbers from your code some numbers from others and if there's a number in there you don't like by all means change it um to the extent anything has to be in here um it the the whereas Clauses while lengthy are done to bolster you the possibility of a future defense I'm not going to represent to you that you absolutely must have them or we can't pass this I do want to make that clear that I respect your your Authority as the policy makers in that regard so with that I am I'm pulling up pulling up the ordinance at the moment Mr Mayor had it in hard copy but I want to make sure I'm pulling up the digital so I can more quickly get to the highlighting so with that I don't need any guidance on the ordinance number I think it's page four page 12 is the first one thank you the first one is abandoned or discontinued sign or structure or signer structure is considered abandoned or discontinued when its owner fails to operate or maintain a sign for a period of at least it's presently 60 days this is really targeted towards most especially where you have that and we've all seen this especially following the recession that major business in your community again in your community you don't really have a business district but let's say uh to the extent you have the Condominiums a building gets destroyed post some unfortunate natural disaster and then that sign sits there for another five years because yes they technically own the property and they're not doing anything with it what is an abandoned sign um and and what are the what are the regulations that flow from that so with that in mind 60 days was a number if you have a number that you wish differently or an opinion on the matter by all means please let us okay the 60 days looked fine to me but I have a question going through it is like how soon once you hit the 60 days we should have in there at that point we declare it I guess there's a term how long do they have to remove it saying you hit 60 days we make a statement and then now you have two weeks to remove said sign so my hesitation is only to explain first how code enforcement typically works because there's the notion that you are in violation of our code versus when you actually comply or when we get some kind of order of compliance because let's say we deem a sign abandon and there's and I have to revisit some element of this what what requirements extend because this is just the definition section you know what what obligations flow from that so um as L equals earlier on but I I think it is in the code thereafter but let's say the code says that um an abandoned sign it says signs that are deemed abandoned prohibited signs and under 86-4 um so on page 26 of this is where that flows to and it says that signs that are deemed abandoned under this chapter that do not conform with provisions of this section shall be removed by the property owner within 30 days after receipt of notification which will immediately follow the 90-day and that would have to harmonize that a 90-day abandonment period described in this chapter um that such removal is required so they would get 90 days once deemed removed I mean sorry 30 days from that notice but let's say they don't that doesn't mean on day 31 the city hires a hauling company and we take it away it means they're in violation to the code they're going to get a hearing date they're going to go before match trade the Magistrate's going to say come into compliance by X date if they don't then they'll get a fine for every day pass that day and if they continue to ignore it Define a cruise so there's this unsatisfying result on some level where somebody says I thought they had to remove that thing in 90 days it's still sitting out there and it's been six and seven months what's going on here City well there's a fine occurring in the background and then that we can potentially get a lien for that and all those every other manner of legal results but the idea that we're going to show up with our own Hauling Company and start taking everything on day 91 or 61 or whatever it is is not perhaps a note in there because sometimes you know we'll uh at least I do I send out these actual things the citizens yeah something's going to come back why aren't you well perhaps in a later section going okay once you've done this it goes into the normal flow which is I don't think it's helpful to codify the code enforcement process in the code I understand that so in that sense it's the the natural operation operation of Law and due process takes over so what uh yes go ahead Mr Roberts um I was just going back to page 26 Randy so just to make sure I understand the flow in that example under a it says a 90-day abandonment period I I just said harmonize that to the 60 or whatever okay but you're right this needs to be the same number whatever right yes sir okay got it so if we set this to third let's say 30 days um what's the what's how much time does the the property or the sign owner actually have before we can go remove the sign we will not be removing the sign I've sent a court order to that effect okay and so what would happen is let's say we have that result and we have the special magistrate holding their in violation and they need to remove it and we're still not getting satisfaction then we would have to file an injunctive action in the court as the plaintiff functionally suing a property owner in the city and get a court order that they need to remove it or give us the right uh to cure in that case and I I'm involved in a very similar matter in another community and it has taken us 10 years and that structure is still there point taken um well let's just kind of go around the room here and uh and see what everyone thinks on this um council member Notaro no we're talking about the 60 days 60 days and I think that's reasonable I think that's reasonable council member Roberts um I agree I don't have any problem with that so we're going to remove some signs in 60 days and other signs can stay up definitely I don't I did not say that sir well the short answer is yes if somebody has a sign in their front yard that says save all manatees and it's a temporary sign we're not going to remove that at any point that's political speech is that not conflict with Gilbert's ruling and Thomas's ruling of even-handed uh distribution of this law because I don't want to get into the whole thing I mean I would never vote for any of this I mean okay the Supreme Court ruling is crystal clear respectfully disagree especially well eight cents concurrences and and since 1789 you you two you attorneys can't get together that's why we have a supreme court and the problem here is you got what 27 Pages 30 pages of the sign ordinance and it still would be challenged in the court because you're allowing one person to do this or one entity to do this and it can be this big this this small you're allowed to leave it here for 30 days you're allowed to leave here and definitely I think I I think you're jumping way ahead on this I'm trying to accept this one I'm just talking about Abandoned and discontinued science I understand that but this is all nonsense and this is just going to get us into trouble and this is how attorneys make money Mr Mayor and I would never vote for something like this I would never impose on my Residence at 30 page ordinance to put a sign in your point and and I just as your legal advisor if it's the majority's will that we do not have an ordinance that reads this way I'm happy to put it in place and while I respectfully uh disagree with the characterization of this I want to be very clear that none of this is driven by a profit motive if it is driven by a desire to uh dutifully represent your community in a way that I have responsibly done and would continue to do but I respect your policy decision to disagree with the proposal and sir I would if if the majority of the body wishes to go in a way I completely respect that and we'll do so council members Abel I agree with 60 days vice mayor Shirley 60 days is great with me council member Livingstone I'm in agreement with 60 days 60 days and I'm fine with that also all right so 60 days Remains the next highlighting Mr Mayor is on the bottom of page 13 where it concerns the definition or area of sign and it says the calculation for a double face sign shall be the area of one face only double face sign shall be so constructed that the perimeter of both faces coincide and are parallel and not more than 24 inches apart so that's the depth of a sign if you have a sign that's two-sided that it can't be you know a whole six feet on one side and six feet on the other essentially you have a cube of a sign and again we're just in the definition section both faces coincide and are parallel I didn't understand this whenever I read it the first time are they 24 inches apart this way yeah that's that's the idea yeah there's the sign now 24 48 50 yeah that's more of a monument sort of like what we have on that's and that is that Monument signs come up in this and that's okay all right well let's go to the opposite direction uh let's start with council members the Livingstone uh if you're talking about a temporary sign I mean I except your um legal expertise on 24 inches 24 inches seems kind of wide to me I would think so this is for all signs the definition is is this is not specific only temporary okay okay my final 24 then I think it could be a little less I think we probably could be like well 12 inches like a foot depth of a to allow a cabinet if it's lighted or something like that um I think 24 is a lot okay council members Abel I could go from 12 to 18. well the reason I think it is is that because you have to have some room for Bulbs Etc I don't know I don't know either council member Banker I renew my objections to this possible unconstitutional nonsense Mr Roberts uh Mr Moore could you give me just one example of that type of sign I think you started to get one so what would be an example just so I get a better visual if you pull up to a McDonald's and they've got a a sign out with the art the let's say at the base there with the Arches on one side and the arch on the other side and in between it's a block and so when you're on either side of that it's house how far apart are is each golden arch you're looking at sideways yeah like your dentist's office all those sorts of Monument type how far apart is each side of the thing and it's to avoid somebody taking up um a great deal of space just basically it's like you're looking at me now I'm the sign but if I turn sideways and you see my gut yeah that's right the size of your gut now I think because we're mostly residential I think 12 would be plenty I don't I don't see a reason for it to be 24. Leslie about for 12. just for argument's sake how wide is our Monument sign ours is larger in 24 about three feet maybe I'd say at least the board's got to be four to six inches and then in between yeah uh well I would be fine with 24. uh so there's there's two 24s 3 12s and an 18. I'll go 24 with you all right and you had 18 so now it's it's split right down the middle so what would we have to do to that Monument situation then that would be out of computers there's a there's a difference first for Government properties as they're regulated in in this and that's also consistent with the Constitutional guidance but I would say that um ultimately if there is a sign um you have a non-conforming structure the structure would likely endure until such time as a structure sign was destroyed in which case it would have to come into compliance is how that would ordinarily be treated yeah well let's go back around Let's uh knock this one out right quick anyone changing your minds I'll change mine 24 is good 24. all right so that's four to two now and again this is the workshop phase if at some point you after today you start realizing I didn't quite know we were looking at something like that or you drive around and start seeing things this is just to get the process started right and after we make these changes we'll be presented with an updated copy and with probably more highlights and things to consider the next definition is artwork uh on top of the very next page if displayed as a two-dimensional representation on a flat surface the same shall not exceed a quarter of the total surface area however if this win so and then the next one is a half there those definitions okay um council member Banker uh would you prefer that I just not call on you during this conversation you can call me for the record I'm going to repeat I renew my objections is unconscious possible and constitutional nonsense I mean this is just like okay I will continue calling on you then uh council member bankerta I'd like to hear your opinion on this uh size I uh renew my objections to this unconstitutional impossible I'm not constitutional nonsense I'd say well we're gonna add it um I'm sorry I'm just thinking graphically yeah one quarter is fine that's the graphics and then obviously underneath or above or sideways is the lettering saying something Hotel our phone number No Vacancy yeah vice mayor Shirley I'm fine with it as it's written it's Livingstone I'm in agreement an agreement right Mr Roberts all good yes zero all right and now I'm just curious is this any surface that they decide to turn into a sign I believe it is yes like Nashville you've seen that it's become like the walls of your building so if I wanted to paint one quarter of my garage door I that that would be acceptable is that right potentially and again that might that would this is it depends factor of every legal issue is going to come in here um but potentially so uh a campaign sign for example if I wanted to do one quarter of my garage door it's okay according to this policy right so I'm looking at as artwork not yeah this is the representation of a creative idea that is expressed in an art form but Dave or mayor he's here Sergeant strikes great question though Mr Mayor there are some our code also has some language about how your house can be painted right so uniform right so that would take care of that problem um the reason why I'm asking this question is is I'm just trying to clarify those assigned policy over right or overrule uh are the uh I guess the property design paint uh Landscaping Etc now that's that's why I brought that up I just wanted to uh was looking for some clarification that's a question I'll digest some more I I just I'm not trying to think about it in in the vacuum of this moment and I'm not in the best position to give you an answer that's that's fine I will agree uh tentatively agree with the one quarter initially though mayor I would say that like an election sign is not a creative idea not as that in within the scope of that definition Stan page 20. yeah I'm not sure about this you were not going I mean is it if I'm the sign or the on the wall of the place you're talking projection from me out into the street 12 inches disabled oh sorry and you hold on because I want him to kind of Define what it is we're talking about and then uh oh and then we'll go around that way so we're on page uh 21 20. sorry 20 it's 21 in the PDF I'm looking at my mistake uh page 20 at the bottom um the definition of a projecting sign is any sign a fixed perpendicular at any angle to a building or wall in such a manner that its Leading Edge extends more than and here it says 12 inches beyond the surface of such building or wall standard Channel set letters on signs do not render sign assign a projecting sign um so here projecting sign is any sign of fixed again to the to the front of the building um or or at an angle perpendicular like this to a building or wall in such a manner that it's Leading Edge extends more and so if you're if you've got coming out of here candy shop and it goes more than 12 inches beyond the surface of the building or wall that it's extending from it can only be 12 inches long basically coming off that wall so a good example would be somebody hanging a welcome sign yeah 12 inches off yes and again I want to reiterate and especially to Echo Mr um Mr bankert's present position I want to be very clear if there's a kind of sign that you're like honestly I don't want that regulated we don't have to regulate it you folks are the policy makers we have given you the here is everything in the universe to consider and um you can take it leave it modify it as you wish thank you very much it's Notaro 12 inches is fine Mr Roberts I'm fine with how it's written Mr Banker because of the last issue that the voice mayor and the mayor brought up by strenuously object to this possible unconstitutional importance Mr zabel well which is okay vice mayor Shirley 12 inches is fine this living Stone I'm in agreement with how it's written I'll agree with that also so we're and I want to be clear that um this is the definition section right um so that's defining what a projecting sign is but under 86-4 which we'll get to in a few pages there's a list and while I did not specifically highlight anything because again all of this is up for discussion as we look at these definitions be mindful that some of these signs are prohibited a projecting sign is a prohibited sign under this as drafted portable signs roof signs all prohibited signs so remember we're in the this isn't a restriction as much as it is a definition okay right and and this is stating anything that projects more than 12 inches out is considered a projecting sign yeah correct all right next page is 22 down at the bottom of the vehicle sign and a vehicle sign is a sign which covers more than 10 square feet of the vehicle identifying a business product or service which is attached to mounted pasted painted or drawn on a motorized or Draw or drawn vehicle and is parked and visible from the public right-of-way unless the vehicle is used for transporting people or materials in the normal day-to-day operation of the business I think that definition speaks for itself again whether or not um you wish to regulate that in a in a certain way is is addressed later on council member Livingstone um as far as the description I'm fine if we're going to address them later on okay vice mayor Shirley council member Sable fine with me councilmember Baker I again object it is possible unconstitutional words um for the sake of expediency if you don't mind I'm just going to buy a pass you on the next you just know that ending objection so I did change it based on the strength yeah exactly all right Mr Roberts yeah so if it is less than 10 square feet Mr Moore what is it defined as not a vehicle sign I'm just curious so ugly instead of it's more if it's more than 10 square and it would not constitute a vehicle sign okay it's not a vehicle sign it's just so yeah if you just have a square foot that says Jimmy John's okay it's not a vehicle okay so later on when they reference a vehicle sign we'll know that it's something that's more than 10 square feet okay I'm good and it sounds to me uh whenever you count the number of square feet uh a small magnetic sign on each one of your doors would be acceptable or what would would not we we couldn't uh qualify it as a vehicle sign Miss Notaro uh 10 square feet works okay and I'll agree with that one also but just to point out something there Mr Mayor so if it's if you have two signs two by three that's 12 square feet so then it's a vehicle sign type of game so I know you have like really large ones which was good they're all my refrigerator now the next thing though not highlighted Mr Mayor in the event any member um went through this meticulously and had concerns I do want to make sure the list of um prohibited signs on pages 26 through 28 are reviewed to make sure there's and vehicle signs are one of those says vehicle signs visible from the street right of way within 100 feet of the vehicle and where the vehicles are for more than two consecutive hours of any 24-hour period that's how that reads again just not any language in here is not a this is exactly what you should have but is intended to make you uh give you the opportunity to evaluate that said um I wasn't sure if there was any input on the prohibited signs as you read that list and sometimes it may require you to go back to the definition section and know precisely what a dependent sign or a win sign is as you go through that list but I just wanted to make sure that you did take a moment to look at that list of prohibited signs and see if anything gave you a concern based on the particular dynamics of your community or your policy positions okay so um maybe what we should do has everyone gone through this list it's just nice did anyone see uh other than council member Banker did anyone see uh something that jumped out at them that should not have been there I just couldn't understand a snipe sign yeah the definition is where did you see that it's in the definition area so snipe signs are colloquially those signs that you just see pop up all around come to my Karate Dojo the things that you get thrown in your right-of-way and the like those are typically what how colloquially that is the definition reads A Sign made of any material when such sign is tacked nailed posted pasted glued or otherwise attached to or placed on public property such as but not limited to a public utility poll street sign utility box fire hydrant right of way public Street Furniture or other public property and then it has an except for an A-frame or t frame sign that is temporarily placed on public property under such limitations and constraints as are in the plan we just want to verify that because in the case of and these are rare but with a marathon they'll frequently put the route signs up on those are typically permitted pursuant to their special event permit and all the other wayfaring requirements they go through to be able to have that event in the first place that is a permitted event not a call me for guitar lessons so absent any specific feedback and again this is just our first go through of this I'll just continue to the next highlighting unless there was a different um unless the council wishes to proceed differently um next highlighting I think the vehicle somewhere to have an issue but I think there's I'm sorry the vehicle sign there's plenty of job sites there are trailers are parked there with signage on the vehicle well in your community being smaller tighter what's visible from the right-of-way is bigger than what you might see in a community where there's more um separation so if you that's definitely prohibited in the prohibited sign list it's FF on page 28 of the document 29 if you're well if you're following along digitally um so if if that's a prohibited sign category definition you wish to revisit um by all means a restriction I should say by all means please let me know meaning where code enforcement out right yeah that's what I thought he had allowed a render the previous reading that we had um unless said vehicles used for transporting people are materials in the normal day-to-day operation of the business so if I got an electrician that's going to be I don't know handyman that's working there uh eight hours he's in the um day-to-day operation of his business so that type of science even though it's more than 10 foot it's on the side of his van that's okay because it's going to be I'm not so sure that's how that's intended to operate because by definition every vehicle is intended to transport people right um I'm not so sure that's how that definition would be applied I mean look revisit that the way I see this I'm going okay this is like the condo ordinance where you can't drive your work truck home and Market in your driveway is kind of what I'm seeing this as I'm not saying that that's bad but I am saying that there are several construction trailers I see around town that have the contractor's name on them that are parked on the site during the term of the construction period so or on the side of a dumpster actually no we're revisiting it seeing vehicles used for the transporting people or materials in the normal day-to-day operation of the business so yes your interpretation so a dumpster Etc they're all okay I would I would I would read that that way but again I will flag that as something that I I give particular attention to um but in the definition and and its application in FF was there anything else that jumped out nope all right um the highlighting in blue is just to make sure that I'm looking at cross references making sure they're still good once we go to do finalize this so I'm only going to stick to the yellow the next yellow I see is signs for illegal non-conforming use on page 30 at the very bottom a non-conforming sign for non-conforming use that's used to be used for a period of 60 consecutive days and that's consistent with the abandonment definition that we've done earlier is replaced by conform use shall be considered a prohibited sign and shall be removed you do have very limited uses in your community but if for example you had and I saw this in another Community for example we have an old used car lot where you couldn't put a used car lot today and they stopped selling used cars for 90 days um you know and one has that abandoned business but is it a non-conforming sign um you know for a non-conforming use hey they and they also had a giant let's say they had a mounted you know Chrysler LeBaron or something in the sky they're an old Chef 57 Chevy on a pole okay you've been in the it's non-conforming use in a non-conforming sign both gotta go um and that's it's that's just that 60 days I think given the guidance earlier on abandonment that's consistent and I don't think you need to revisit that unless a member has a concern about it beyond the standing objection is everyone fine with 60 days or do we have any different opinions on the same with the signs discontinued so I'll continue to scroll through for um yellow highlighting in the document where as lengthy as the document is we're nearing the end of things that were specifically flagged on page 38 . on 86 19 temporary sign installation and removal unless otherwise provided for in this chapter and I'll tell you that this is where a lot of communities to spend a lot of time in their Awards hold on one second yes sir we were on 30 and then you went to 38 uh 31. oh I'm sorry the 31 was another 60 days on an abandoned sign I I didn't call it out but it was another discontinued sign and it was consistent I again would stand by that being consistent everybody okay with a Conformity there okay [Music] the next thing um is temporary sign removal uh section 8619 unless otherwise provided for in this chapter temporary signs shall not be erected for more than 100 days prior to the event being advertised on the temporary sign begins and they shall be removed promptly at the event at the event's conclusion temporary signs not advertising an event to occur on a specific date but which are related to the occurrence of an expected future event or transaction including but not limited to real estate for sale signs shall not be subject to the 100-day provision of the subsection such shines shall also be removed promptly upon the earliest of the occurrence of the event or transaction so if you're saying for sale you don't know when sale is going to happen so you might be out for more than 100 days but once sale happens it comes up I mean it's that real estate regulation is offered as an example it's not a regulation directed based on content uh and so in this in this particular case um the hundred days this would apply to an election you can't put if you agree as written you can't put a vote for Randy sign out more than 100 days before election day notwithstanding early voting notwithstanding the ways that those constructs have changed and so that same is true on the common for the Cure run on November 10th or something so understand it's it's it makes it frustrating for some policy makers because you're treating too inherently to similar things in a similar way um but that is the construct that we're operating Within the question you're talking about 100 days applying to a political sign but then subsection B on 39 talks about 60 days for political science specifically for political specifically you see that sorry forgive me it has been a moment since I looked at the document in full and remembered all of its content uh yes that those are those are their specific requirements for political science as opposed to other temporary Senate so political science is 60 days yeah that's good I'm going to tell you that that's that that drafting note and this was drafted in um in cooperation with one of my colleagues I want to make sure that we we revisit that um just to make sure that we're still based on some more recent cases still good with that uh but yes and at this point I would ask for your input as it's written um so the 100 days for um 100 days for general rule concerning temporary signs um if you wish and again that would be Coleman real estate whatever um no no earlier than 100 days before the the special event so but I'm curious why uh 101 not 90 why where'd that number come from it's not based on a very specific policy it's I um it's it's based on a number that's been seen in other codes um whether you know if you wish to make it 90 45 that's again we're looking to you and that's why it's there as a placeholder not there as the as the gold standard and this would uh primarily be for events forthcoming um so what are we doing right now Kyle with uh uh let's see we had the chili cook-off we had um the beach cleanup we've had several events here how how far in advance are are you putting signs out uh if the maximum was two weeks I think in 30 days dial it back not oh instead of 100 yeah [Music] I think 30 should be plenty I can't think of a reason for it to be more than that I'd go for 30 I think 100 ish over a long time 30 30 yes so that uh that added on uh page 38 would be 30. Mr 30 understood all right and then uh now we're to page 39. this is the 60 days for uh political signs I know that whenever they were out for 105 people were angry that's a mess it was awesome you didn't start it thoughts yeah my thoughts are and and you're right a lot of feedback from the citizens and clearly um 60 days most of our elections are in March time frame I think a key date that that's going to be after is the Christmas holidays and people were sad about that that there were so many signs out there during you know before Christmas so this way by making it 60 days it would be sometime in January which would be great I think that I think that that's a that's a good idea others question um as far as removing them candidates for federal state county municipal or district office have to get them out within 30 days or candidates for city office within 72 hours wow well yeah what's the difference here locally you can you know walk down next door and pull the side versus you get a candidate for a city a state office they got to get their campaign workers they can organize that and that was my thought behind that that's what it takes that's only if they win if they lose you pick it up the president because in a residential yes it's going to be in somebody's front yard which he had to approve it so they can take it out yeah definitely uh vice mayor Shirley is on to something uh I think that the elections the local elections that we have we're working and we're going out how you doing uh can I put a sign in your yard or would you like one and then who does it we do it right and then three days within three days we go right out usually the next day and we pick them right back up the other signs are actually being placed by the homeowner they're going and getting those signs so it's it's a different situation and they may not necessarily be there there is we're going to pick them up ourselves so uh thoughts can we shorten it to maybe 15 days or something yeah it really seems like a lot but it does great 14 days 14 two weeks two weeks everyone agree with that 14. understand that was is that shortening the 30 to the 14 or yeah I think it sure because there's 30 to 40 numbers there I want to make sure we're all talking about if she remains and 72 hours remaining foreign to page 40. and we're getting more and more of these yellow yellow highlights yeah this is this is where a lot more of the of the work is done in this draft um in the temporary signage restrictions and what meets what definitions so the the next page is Page 41. um signs allowed in all districts no permit required temporary signs shall be allowed on each parcel as follows we've enumerated the districts the number of signs and their General Dimensions which are the most common ways of regulating let's post read Gilbert well let's start back on page 40 and uh sorry did I skip one over oh no oh sorry 40. I said 40 again I was looking at the PDF yes on page 40 temporary signs as it relates okay all right so let's uh start with number one there on the RL District uh May display up to four temporary signs shall not exceed four square feet in any sign area and four feet in height are they talking about single-sided signs so you can put four single-sided signs or four double-sided signs you're talking about sign area I think the designs are one and the same I think it's a single or double counts as the same is it is that correct Mr Moore I'm sorry I I was distracted could you say that again are we picking up sounds from someone out uh on Zoom it sounded that way you were in the direction of a laptop sorry and we'll go back to the question about are you talking about single-sided or double-sided signs um in terms of you know doing the calculation right this this portion of the code makes no distinction between a single-sided and a double-sided um sign and that's the way I read it also so that that works uh how about the size everybody okay with that all right and okay very new then uh number two in the RM District each parcel May display one temporary sign which shall not exceed uh 24 square feet in sign area and six feet in height uh ultimately each parcel in the RM District May display up to eight temporary signs which cumulatively shall not exceed 24 square feet inside area and four feet in height so I think what you're saying is if a business wants to stack their signs a certain way then that's okay they want to meet those dimensions and requirements uh this would be permitted again none of these numbers are offered as some gold standard if you wish to change any of them you're free to get a brief question uh just regarding the rlrm I'm not sure about the the abbreviation issues or the terminology maybe the RL is the residential versus RN is it's residential low so it's all the single family homes and then residential medium which is going to be all your Condominiums my concern is a temporary signs in the RM District condo area like we've got 10 units in our building if everyone wanted to put out a different political sign in front you know maybe there aren't that many people running but um what is your HOA say on that Ben what does your HOA say on that do you have I don't know what it says to some of them say no signs oh no no we no I'm just saying some HOH yeah I don't know and and again this it's a point well raised if you have a Condominium Association or homeowners association with its own restrictions we don't enforce that but they they could and would and say hey in addition to the city saying you guys have eight according to us no res no resident is allowed to put anything in the common grass in the you know in our Frontage and so it might be zero even though we we say we give the mate they might say it's zero and and we do we don't have control over how they administer their works we saw a few signs that just disappeared and it was because they their uh HOA removed just completely remove them because they were against policy yeah anyone uh want to challenge that one are you okay with these uh these numbers on one and two okay okay Council okay all right number three temporary size displayed Outdoors shall be constructed of metal plastic wood press wood but not of cardboard or paper and shall be fastened to Temporary support not exceeding four inches by four inches I was trying to figure out exactly what kind of support that would be saving each brackets yeah the real estate signpost okay four by four okay that makes more sense so there's no hype right construction companies right oh yeah cardboard or paper I mean what I'm trying to think of what the political the campaign signs that we've all used what are those constructed of those are plastic yeah okay paper in the Florida summer yeah I think I think the uh I'm guessing the purpose of that is is because as soon as it rains yeah it becomes a paper mache permanently in the uh on the law everyone okay with that one yeah right now we're down to Flags foreign flag pole and I fly a five by eight which is 40 square foot um that'd be in violation of this another flight codes been up for at least seven years neighborhood and I just I as I I just I know I know it sounds redundant but I have to make it very clear for the record none of this is established as some legal standard you guys do what makes sense for your community and if you want any of those numbers changed you are free to change 30. six by five oh the flag is a five by eight but right now I got the two by three but five by eight five by eight that's standard flag size yeah it is um they only lasts about three months before replacing so you do a uh uh a United States flag and a Florida flag and now you're at 80 square feet oh yeah you're way over I think there's provisions of the law that were changed for the United States flag in that room attached to Gilbert I'm sorry I think there were provisions of the Supreme Court ruling um that had been challenged on the United States flag I don't have it in front of me but um in 1917 and uh flying the United States flag and the size of it if you have any of that Authority I'm always happy to consider it anyway I'd just like to change I say 25 is not greater than was it 80 and uh it would be two flags not greater than 40 square feet is that right no uh that would be two see this is two flags not greater than 15. I guess I was thinking about each flag they don't have an each on this one they've got each and the RM one not totally greater than than 80 square feet sign area each okay would that make more sense yeah and then uh 30 for the and then I'll go home and we measure those levels it's 30. your flagpole is 30 feet because I remember it's not much which coincides with our building code right what about the resident has a 40-foot flag right or 35 feet 410 and 40 foot and has a 10 foot flag I don't know which is what they call government at its best um foreign flag pole in the IRL District in a 35-foot flagpole in the RM District larger larger building bigger flagpole that's probably where they where they're going with that okay yeah the reasoning was the differences in uses between the two permissible uses and the two premisable and historical uses in the two but if you wish to harmonize them you're free so on page 41 the 25 uh does everyone agree with 30 are we going to ask Mr zabel to uh do something about it all right uh 30 okay I'm fine with 30 or 35 our our building restriction is we can't go any higher than 35 feet on our on our instructions at 35 35 for both then that simplifies things all right and what did we change the square footage it was it was a total of 80 but I think what it what really what we want to say is one flag or you can have two flags but neither flag can be larger than 40 square 40 each understood on the ground because it pulls only 35. So Randy just just curious to me under B where it says flags and then it talks about not greater than 15 which would change into 40 for each square feet and then it says in sine area so is that just interchangeable flag and a sign would it be more appropriate to say 40 square feet and flag it was a sign okay in that class okay got it okay and so on on uh section two page 41 we're talking about the RM uh District uh they're allowed to have two flagpoles up 35 feet uh but then they're limited to one on one flagpole and two on the other is that is it am I reading that correctly sorry I'm trying to make sure I'm reading in the same place three flags not greater than 24 square feet uh in sign area may be displayed but two flagpoles are allowed I think that if you're gonna do this they're probably gonna have one maybe they could have them at each end of the property they could have them side by side uh but ultimately uh why not allow them to have four and give them the same rules that we do if you have a flagpole you can put two flags on it if you have two flag poles and you can have a total of four Flags that makes sense me man whatever you guys want that sound all right in the same square footage right would apply yeah the same consistent the 40. well the square footage the square footage would be 40 per flag a total of four Flags but uh no more than two flags per whole and then do we have anything in here that addresses these um I I forget Mike's able you may know uh what what the actual name of it is but it's the T configuration where that is the traditional Yacht Club it's an across me so you got the main Mast and the the cross where you put the signal flags and then they stream signal flags all the way top to bottom so um you gotta watch what they read because sometimes we like putting different words on so that that's not been addressed uh tolerance by the way I'm sorry dots compiling that because we have somebody in the Locale that does have a I think it's like a eight-footer and has the halyards that they drop you know little signal flags on or do we just uh just label that as as a single flag and ignore the uh the pennants because the defendants are really small in fact occasionally off-white Penance myself just bringing it up all right Mr Moore would you like to uh review item C with us on page 41. the parking space science hotel motel apartment on state parking on-site parking space number identification signs not exceeding two square feet excuse me of sign face per sign shall be allowed on each parcel within the RM district one such sign shall be allowed for each parking space maximum height for a freestanding or attached wall sign is six feet uh to me uh pretty direct what it's what it's saying there but again if you wish to change that I think that's pretty consistent with DOT as well everyone good with that one yeah all right B um similarly this relates to street address signs and those put on residential mailboxes um with a limit of one attached Wall Street address sign um and the street address sign shall not exceed two square feet inside area does that include some people put their house number on the the curb of the drainage well they'll do a painted stenciled house excuse me it says a Wall Street address the mailboxes I don't think as written that it would it would extend to a curb as it says the to the wall and the mailbox as written if you wish for it to be explicitly accepted or included please let me know trying to accept it everyone okay with that all right uh let's see here now we're at F no uh yes word f and uh warning signs and safety signs not a seat in four square feet in sign area shall be allowed in all districts maximum height for these signs shall be four feet unless otherwise required by applicable law explain to me are we talking about uh a good example uh hazardous Beach day something like that what what type of warning signs are we talking about you look on page 23 is defined Pages you say lesson on page 23 warning sign is defined provides warning of a dangerous condition or situation that might not be readily apparent like Riptide or Brookline there's a group tied like a hole in the lot like I mean any high voltage gas lines yeah since Fallen power line we just figured that out when it's bouncing the way it reads in the definition section is a sign which provides warning of a dangerous condition or situation that might not be readily apparent or that poses a threat of serious injury EG for example a gas line high voltage condemned building Etc or that provides warning of a violation of law example no trespassing no hunting allowed Etc beware of dog essentially that's a warning uh four square feet but that could be anywhere so uh how does everyone feel about this one four feet all right fine okay what's that should be two square feet I'm trying to think of like a that's a one by two by two she was four so yeah I I'm trying to think of you know you see the no trespassing oh the traditional they're about uh those all by eight they're small and that's usually to keep somebody from entering your property uh but what if you're driving down the street and there's something uh a message I just uh trying to think of all possibilities of where a warning sign and safety for instance like there's a sign nailed to a tree next to a bridge that says no trespassing or no fishing or something you're talking about and you know what's to prevent that sign from getting I got you two by two you know hold on one second um I'd like to speak to the citizens that are uh out in the audience uh tonight is a work session uh this is not uh typical where we take citizen comments uh about about any subject that happens to uh be on your mind at the time I see that I have quite a few um let's see okay uh whenever we get to items that are on the agenda I will call upon you for these particular ones that I see one about uh selling property uh I I can't help you with that one tonight uh however uh you're welcome to hang around until the end of the meeting and uh speak to any of us and then we'll uh we'll we'll try to respond to you at that time um and the purpose of that is to keep this meeting going and uh we will be wrapping up this meeting at 9 00 PM so we'll all be available if you'd like to speak to us directly any questions I'm sorry well we've got several things that are on the agenda that I I will be more than happy to hear your opinion uh but I can't promise you that we'll get to it because this is a this is a LinkedIn meeting no official acts can yeah all this is is a work session and uh feel free to contact any of us and whenever we do our regular uh council meeting on the first Monday of every month the very first thing that we do is we take citizen comments and if there happens to be a concern about a certain agenda item we'll call upon you at that time for those items cool thank you thank you okay where were we we had Waterfront identification signs Mr Mayor unless you unless you folks were still concerned about the poor feed on warning signs okay any issues with that one um vice mayor Shirley I mean I don't know how I mean you know it could be abused I think it we should consider a reducing the size of that but for a four foot sign is a pretty big sign for a to be nailed to a tree yeah I agree with you on that um how does everyone else feel that's at least the way I read this one this is going to be on the waterfront visible from the water I'm still talking about she was still on warnings yeah the warning signs yeah I I I'm with you I understand that one it shouldn't be a two by two at all yeah one what's that size that's one of those yeah I'm thinking like a you know what is it one and a half by one would be the most was it three square feet something like that or keep it at two I don't know but I think it needs to be smaller than a four square foot sign does everyone else agree with vice mayor Shirley so you just want to make it two square feet on on uh item F right yes item f good morning six one and a half by one would be obviously one and a half square feet which would be less than two if you wanted to make it two square feet yeah how about the 12 year old that loses his dog or cat are we going to hold that 12 year old to the size of the sign and post it up on that telephone pole if it stays it might get taken down because it's a what do we call that sniper that would constitute a snipe sign the the and the maximum price the maximum High okay okay then back to the Waterfront identification signs uh do you have a problem with leaving that at four square feet everyone okay with that one because uh you need to be able to read those yeah yeah right no way yeah I agree all right uh temporary window signs for any hotel or motel one or more temporary window signs may be displayed on the inside of a window temporary Windows sign shall not cover more than 50 percent of the uh area of the window except that if the hotel or motel displaying such signs is also displaying the one permanent sign window sign authorized by this chapter then the total area of the window covered by a combination of these shall not exceed 30 percent of the area of the window yeah you know this is for a hotel motel um I don't really care yeah I mean what would they put in there like No Vacancy just a little paper sign inside the window or something we don't have a hotel or motel on the beach that's right even though it looks like wine looks like one it sounds like one again if there's any category of this that you just don't think is necessary to regulate then just say we you can strike that from any provision of this or if you think this too um too much you can just I think I think that you could leave it in or take it out and it's not going to make any difference one way or the other well my recommendation to you is if you don't think it makes any difference in your community then you likely don't need it and we can take it out if you would save us some money on our yeah goat municode yes so strike letter I is everybody okay with that yes should we wait until we get through our um review Planning and Zoning gets through their review before we officially say strike it put a question mark next to it okay Mission intense that's right definitively stricken page 42. holes banners temporary banners for displays on the light poles shall not exceed 12 square feet in area or 20 feet in height um is this the holiday sign or we're I believe we're exempt from that if we with our holiday signs I just wasn't sure because we in fact we're talking about that later on tonight I think that this is probably applies to us also yeah but that's a pretty darn big sign or a banner uh 12 square feet man that's not terrible two by six two by six uh or 20 feet in height how big are the ones that are on the light posts I thought I bet that those are are like two by three and a half like yeah something like that they're like two by four two by three and a half okay depends upon whether you're a palm tree or a starfish [Laughter] well there was definitely some mermaids down there yeah I'm fine with that size yeah thoughts uh and this and this is something to consider because we're we're looking at uh uh doing other things in the future than what we're doing right now I have a thought actually um I know I saw Kyle and his crew putting up a sign on the on the building recently was that for the Milling football was it it would be a health and wellness yeah the health and wellness so my thought was you know because I see cables going across the street then I think we discussed this previously one time that if we put a a permanent cable just the permanent cable across at the same height it would have to be higher than whatever lower cable was already there just so we're not causing any issues and then whatever type of signs uh banners that we want to put in or advertising for something you know we could just put that on there stream it across and it's up in less than two minutes I like the idea but it's not code we're not that's not a code discussion well are you talking across this going across uh the causeway right so I'm just talking like um you know crossing the street right here so when you're coming across the bridge and you're going home or the other direction so there it is you're going to tie the cable across the street garage at what height it would like I said it would have to be higher than whatever the lowest f-dot that has requirements because you're bringing in equipment or whatever like but that's why I say we have to be higher so in other words because there are cables that go right across that street similar to what they do let's say another time okay got it got it got it so that's why I was bringing it up to about the size of the of the banner but we could we can talk about that later okay this is uh strictly for lipoles is what this is discussing okay where they're attached to lipoles okay so just one poll one Banner got it 12 and 20. everybody okay with that yes yes all right and uh Mr Moore everywhere I see blue is that where you need to verify that it's flagging the cross references so that we make sure yes okay okay uh we are at B2 which is temporary signs at construction sites the sign shall not exceed 32 square feet I'm assuming this is the coming soon great this big beautiful mcmansion uh okay four by eight that's pretty good sound it used to be 24 feet and I think we probably should so wait 24. four squares yeah 24 square feet four by six which is still big yeah it is everybody okay with 24 sure you see that Mr Moore 24 from 32 yes sir all right uh all signs shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from all property lines that would put the sign slab in the middle of the site yes yeah probably I would say two feet from property line because you've got your easement and then your property so and you got the driveways that's true yeah yeah so you're agreeing with the 10 feet smaller like two or three feet two or three feet but you can't put it in the setback so yeah I think you're right because you got your setback and then you've got your you know your property and then you've got the easement out at the road Frontage so if you're a couple of feet in from that from the easement which is what is it three feet or they got the right away so that's typically right yeah 10 to 15 feet off that road Edge depending where you're at and then then it starts the property line and then from the property line to where the front is your feet from the center of road or from the edger from about 1050 from the edge of Road why would you even have a number then just say uh it's it's illegal to place uh one of these signs in the right-of-way anywhere yeah thank you right 86 23 a one permanent wall window or a monument sign is allowed for each such building or complex not to exceed 24 square feet in size however such a sign when a monument sign shall not exceed six feet in height and this is on the RM District but this would be their permanent sign stating who they are and this is the dolphin condos or whatever I'm just making up a name I don't know if that's in here something like the monument side that announces like this is Vista Del Mar Corona Del Rey yeah um that's that's how that would be um that's that Monument sign that you think of with the pedestalism that's uh it's no bigger than what we're doing with the temporary signs for construction companies anybody okay with that I think it's fine all right and we're just saying yeah Monument science they're only allowed Monument signs is that what we're that's not the only because they're allowed directional on the next provision um and there's a difference here between a window or a Monumental signs and such well there's raw signs I mean there are there are different ones I wouldn't say it's the only one but it's the main one the largest ones to be sure in the campaign exceed to pull my definitions out and put them over here I can scroll to a mirror if there's a if there's a definition you want red for the benefit of this we're almost finished now yeah directional signs that's uh telling uh where to turn exit okay where to go all right four square feet for those that's one most of those are inside the property anyway so uh all right see traffic can say one or more attached wall signs shall be allowed on the first level of first floor level the combined areas such signs still not exceed 150 square feet and that covers any kind of sign for again if they want to put the name of the complex on the building that's where that would go that's most most directly what that's addressing but yes these are non-lit signs everybody okay with C 150 yes the canopy or awning sign may be permitted uh let's see here instead of a wall sign the canopy or awning and signage square footage combined and shall not exceed the total permissible square footage for a wall sign the height of the canopy or awning shall not exceed 16 feet first floor or 25 feet second floor everybody okay with those Heights yes yes way finding directional signs on motel hotel condominium or apartment property providing such signs do not exceed four square feet which matches what we've already just discussed the directional sign may be displayed as an attached sign window sign or as a monument sign if displayed as a monument sign the monument sign shall not exceed four feet in height we good with that yeah and it's their property and uh more power to them uh foot page 43 temporary Banner size signs not exceeding 35 square feet in area and eight feet in height may be displayed by a hotel motel condominium or apartment building in conjunction with a grand opening for a maximum of 60 days from the date the building first opens I guess an example of that would be a brand new condo they'd knock one down and put a new one up and they're uh open house everybody okay with that yes okay moving right along here almost there mayor yeah well that was fun the rest of it is is the recitations and and otherwise doesn't have highlighting but I would just again wish to say that you know now that we've gone through this as a body in a in a more detailed fashion noting of course the standing objections um if any of you have additional feedback you wish to give in the interim as this progresses to the process I believe it's available to you member bankert if you have case law that you would like me to review and consider that may inform a better work product I'm happy to look at that as well um and uh with that unless there's any other action I'll incorporate these revisions work with staff and would you folks like to see this I'm not trying to meeting you to death nor do I think I need it but do you want to see this again before this goes to Planning and Zoning or do you want me to I want us to clean this up take it to pnz and then come back to you um I just want to make sure we have shared expectations on the process I would like to see it uh cleaned up but everything or the changes put in but I would like like the highlights to remain so they can see specifically because even though there's a lot of uh material it was relatively easy to go through it this way and just get it out in the open any uh any other comments from the Council on this particular topic Miss Livingstone another question for it goes to planning and zoning and then great question so procedurally how this would normally work if you folks are subject to any other input you might have we'd clean this up it's already basically an ordinance format so we're not talking about an idea that needs to be drafted take the ordinance to them and say hey there look the commission is looking to changes they would have a meeting much like the one you just had make their recommendations to you you would adopt them reject them ultimately you're the governing body and you'd have a first reading of an order if you wish what we likely do given the nature of this particular ordinance is maybe have one more Workshop you don't have to um again if you folks don't feel that necessary what would happen is you'd have a first reading so you'd have a council meeting I would read it by title only and again you'd go through and say you know hey we've had two workshops on this Planning and Zoning has made the additional changes do you wish to change this any further do you wish to scrap it you know because an ordinance can fail just because it's presented doesn't mean you have to pass it and then we would have and assuming it passes we would have to have a second meeting that meeting would be advertised um that the ordinance title would be advertised in the paper again we would take public comment at the first meeting and the second and then ultimately in a second vote and if it passes again then it's made part of your code would it not be or would it be unreasonable to ask if Kyle and his team while all this is going on in the background the for the RM properties just to kind of do a visual on say their flagpole Heights or their signage just to make sure because if we're off by say one foot or what have you you hate for them to go to the expense of and just report back and say you know everything's currently within what we're asking or there's this one it's six feet larger but this other one has one that's one foot or I think it's perfectly appropriate for again this was drafted an initial draft the one you're looking at was drafted by the lawyers saying here's what we got to do long for absolutely staff should um could make the effort of going through and making sure hey based on the numbers we're talking about does this present an issue in our community and that can be part of any staff reporting to you as we go through that process to say hey I know we all talked about 35 but actually half the ones in this community are 36 or whatever that is um but I I the only the only couching I would do of that is to say you know that as we do each ordinance it's not customary to have renderings and everything every single time so it's not so as not to create that kind of expectation but given the nature of this and it's in its city-wide application certainly you and and also U.S council members you folks are part of that process while staff can do you say staff you guys have a pretty lean team um while staff can do that it's also helpful for you folks if you say Hey you know we went in through this in another community and they're like hey but what about the fish restaurant that's been here since 45 they've got this giant thing out there like okay we need to either address that or decide as a community that we don't want it anymore or whatever the thing is and reflect that in our ordinance so as you look around in light of having gone through this now you you could you are part of that process and if you wish to inform staff I have some concerns what we were talking about based on properties X Y and Z then please let us know as well so I have a a recommendation whenever it goes to Planning and Zoning there's a good possibility that they're going to disagree on some of the recommendations that we're making so what I would like to see is after Planning and Zoning reviews it uh whatever the changes are I'd like for them to be uh just Redline so that we can we can quickly see where we can see what their recommendations were uh I think one more work session to review their recommended changes and we can probably zip through it in five ten minutes and uh and then put it in front of the council to vote on at the next meeting not this coming meeting but the next the next meeting in which it is presented and do we uh what what is the next um meeting date for planning and zoning the first Wednesday Wednesday the first of February okay uh will you be able to have this prepared for them by then we we could but candidly I don't think they would have the sufficient time to digest it and they would be in a position where they'd say thanks Kyle can we meet on this again um my suggestion to you is that before Wednesday's meeting we get it so that we can get it to them as soon as next week in terms of these edits um and I'm only saying next week because I know what my current caseload is this week uh but we could have it to them as soon as Monday next week and say hey start digesting this now I'm at the pnz meeting and tell them we have another one I'm just concerned about their ability we've waited a long time and I think if we have to wait another month or two it's it's perfectly acceptable we cost this out for Muni code how much it would cost the publishers I have not sir that's uh Administration Patty would you know how much or Kyle how much would this cost to put it in the municode saying to publish on municode if we were to publish on municode what would munico charge us to add this to the to our codified um online database it's 45 pages here yeah well they're only going to do the changes they don't do 45 pages it's all but then it's hard to do I'm sorry what it's all changes but they also don't adopt what we're asking us but the original one was only six pages they're not going to do 45 pages but what they will do is I think they do a page before and a page after that they charge you for so really there's no way to really estimate what they're going to charge because of what change they make like Randy said they're not going to go line by line they're just going to make the changes they need to but then they're going to add in the additional pages so I mean I could look up a previous something similar in I didn't know I didn't know if they had a cost Factor put in for each page that's crazy you know what I'm saying yeah they do but then we don't know how many pages that's going to take them their Pages aren't like our pages right um May I make a request or halfway through the meeting can we take a quick five-minute break we sure can all right it is 7 28 Zoom at 7 35. um [Music] all right foreign all right everyone uh we're back and now we are on to agenda item two which is uh an agenda item that Mr Banker will actually enjoy talking about all right uh and that is a discussion of Bowie's installed and maintained at Bel Air Shore Beach accesses um I actually added it to the agenda I'd uh to the work session agenda because Mr bankert was not available at our last meeting however um uh uh based on Mr Banker's request I decided to pursue this and uh and I addressed the uh Bellaire Shore commission uh concerning this and uh the way that I presented it was um not speaking specifically for the city and committing to anything but it was more of a what if scenario and so I asked them the question and I think Mr bankert has asked them the same thing in writing and he's also gone spoken uh can we provide you with buoys in your uh town and we may we fully fund them and maintain them and the answer was yes they would allow us to do that um and then I said okay I will bring this information back to the council and I will see what the council would like to do so my initial thoughts on this before we we get into a discussion on it uh I wanted wanted to go ahead and share my thoughts was that um Bel Air Shore even though we do not own that property that is our beach too um and I feel that whatever we do on the north end of our beach we should do on the south end of the beach and not treat the citizens any differently so if we're going to put every 100 yards buoys on the north end I would fully support putting them on the south end but it comes at a price and um I would like for the city manager to kind of give us a rundown on on what we're expecting to pay to do a project like this can I just briefly say one thing I wasn't at the Bellar Shores meeting that you spoke to with a bunch of residents were and they said you did a super job expressing the safety for the people 19 and I really appreciate that Mr thank you very much Mr riefler um so the costs involved you're looking at I calculated 16 for our swim zone for them to extend all the way down to the South jurisdiction uh it'd be better to do about 18 markers and the uh price for that is roughly around uh five thousand dollars for the markers themselves with the shipping and then and that covers their entire Beach or only the accesses that would cover the entire Zone like continuing our Zone all the way down to all the way down to First Street right oh yes and then uh for the installation I I got a recent quote from uh who usually comes in lowest um and for our 16 markers we're looking at twenty thousand dollars eight twenty twenty eight hundred so I'm assuming because that's a full day's work it's gonna be roughly the same whether it's two more movies or not um or very close to can you repeat how much it was gonna cost so twenty thousand eight hundred dollars for installation and five thousand for the markers and shipping and and that is all the way uh that is completely covers all of Bel Air Beach yes from foreign 20 000 you said installation yes and five thousand for the markers down there yes there were 16 markers 18. I do 18 on their section so and then what's the cost for uh 19th to Harrison I'm just curious about the project over here give or take it's roughly the same thing I'm basing the numbers off what I did for our swim Zone yeah okay there's my costs you know fifty five hundred thousand more yeah the extra markers so Kyle what's just the the one single number ballpark that that we're we're paying for our City's paying for in order to get the buoys from first to 19th Street the Bellair Shores I'd say 27 to be safe A 27 000 yeah okay so that's the new buoys being put in installed ready to roll yes okay 27 000 okay now on top of that um let's just say we reset the clock on the live span of these buoys uh you said they're good for how long on average couple of years a couple years I'd say at least one year um in our last batch we didn't start seeing them go away until two years but that kind of depends on what the storm cycle is um so I mean average one to three but you get say we get a pretty rough storm you know our first year out um could change that because they start staggering a little bit but eventually say maybe three by three year a year three they'll they will all have been replaced again as that I would say replace my three year cycle okay yeah all right so if it's not a a inexpensive pill to swallow uh but um I I still stand behind whatever we do for the north we should do for the South even though it's not our beach because our citizens our residents are walking across the street and once they cross the access just because they have to leave their umbrellas there doesn't mean that they're not swimming everywhere else that they're not putting chairs out on the sand so they use their Beach just like we use our beach and um I I again whatever we do for the city needs to be for the entire city and not just for the North or the South is my opinion I don't know who the contractor is that if you are as previously but if I could pass these pictures out has the technology changed any since the last time we actually dealt with buoys from a standpoint of there's new technology out there that will hold those buoys in place better they usually break at the the hardware that connects the buoy to whatever's anchoring it and over time and what I'm showing you is one picture of a buoy that washed ashore and there's other ones I have same thing if you I don't know you guys know anything about rigging but you can see there's a shackle that's in that picture and you can see there's a stainless steel wire tied to the eye bolt of the shackle that screws into the Journal of the other shackle well this clever fraudulent I could use some other words tied that retaining pin so it wasn't all the way in to the shackle's shoulder why would why would you do something like that because as the buoy moves back and forth on the chain it causes a friction and uh deteriorates the throat especially where the shoulders are on the um the threads okay which breaks loose now that bolt shoulder was always screwed in that would have never failed further there's a stainless steel eye on the buoy and it's a carbon shot shackle so the carbon is going to rust and this is why buoys fail and this was a deliberate fail I reported these things to the FWC they don't really care but someone I I gave I gave numbers to the towns uh that the buoys are because they must have a permit number on them and everything like that and someone should go after this contractor for installing stuff like this is that our movie no this was up in sand King it was seeing those didn't last long up there the ones they put at Sand Key they lasted about a month but something like that it was seawater it'll it'll chew that shackle right up I guess it's going after looking for them can we get samples in their work and if they can bring in a sample going this is how we connect them yeah we there's a best practice um that Indian Rocks uses as well that I took from them um it's all stainless steel Hardware it's it was specified when we get the quotes um in my experience that the contractor we've used two times now has done what he was told to do um I haven't seen anything contrary to that but um it's definitely something that can be inspected before no I'm not falling or past city manager or anything like that I mean he's not out there doing this I mean this is you throw it in the water and once you go under there and inspect it and I will I'm honors but um yeah Mr Mayor yeah I'm fine with that uh if I could ask those can we say let's take the entire project like you said from first to Harrison and put that into our current city budget so we can see basically it's more a thought process to see what it would do in the out years saying if we every uh two years we have to do a replacement and put that that number in there for us just to get a kind of a good feeling about what we can expect but I mean yeah I agree with you it's look you're swimming you're going to drift and we did that to protect people so make sure we got the buoys going all the way up we budget five thousand dollars a year for boats yeah right now but I commend you wanting to do this from first to Harrison as Mrs Abel said is that really necessary because you know what I'm saying because talking to FWC they don't really have a hundred yard requirement they don't even have a requirement that you can bring your boat you can't bring the boat in right at the boat okay but if the buoy is a hundred yards passed then you can bring the boat in and it's enforced by Pinellas County Sheriff's Department so my whole thing was keep the Weekend Warriors from coming in drunk or whatever like that and technically I mean we've had people come here and saying I'm going to lose my boating Privileges and that if we spread them out just a little bit why can't we sell a permit to our boating residents for five bucks and they can still bring their boat in where it's not confliction no no they can't so they can bring a boat in presently as long as it's not under power of motor based on the public bathing Beach that you folks establish so if it's not under wind power and it's not under motor power the boat is allowed in the public bathing Beach you folks established that's what the ordinance is but FWC I wrote to them and they sent me back a written email saying you know we don't enforce that Pinellas County Sheriff okay so if we modify something by saying hey look you can bring the boat in you know as long as keep the buoys more than 100 yards apart and you it it's the imaginary line that keeps the weekend warrior and the person that the people of Bel Air Shores people of Valor Beach you have no problem with saving it's the big and look I'm not defense vacationers or anything like that it's those yeah we know we know who they're for and and we know what uh what we're trying to do and it's uh just basically establish a line of don't come flying through here in your boat uh and and it I think whenever we discuss this for the north side the actual Bel Air Beach uh whenever we try to do spacing there were uh complaints about well why am I in a boat zone why am I not in a boat zone why uh you couldn't make everyone happy and uh what whatever it is we do we just need to make it the same in uniform all the way down the beach uh and of course we need to see numbers and this is not something we'll decide on immediately but my question is it's does the council want to entertain this idea and at least start doing the research some things that are involved is that uh they have to have permitting also and that does cost money and we would be required to pay that for that permit um it does it's just time okay well I think as far as uh from a legal perspective that their attorney is more than happy to step up and help with this project um and to that extent what we will certainly need some kind of I would strongly advise that we have some kind of interlocal agreement that was the last that was the last thing I was going to say was that I know that was a source local would need to be modified and uh and this would be a good time to uh actually look at at both of our interlocals and uh I think that this would be a Goodwill project that would probably help us to resolve some of the issues that we have with our our current access uh interlocal agreement absolutely mayor you got my support I have some questions yeah so um is Bel Air Shores willing to put in place the same ordinance we have in place and that's what we need to discuss and because they they do know that it would require an ordinance change they are aware of that and so that's where uh because the the uh city manager and the City attorney do their job and uh and and go ahead and and give all the information and be transparent and see if they're really interested in allowing us to do this obviously uh it's a great deal for them but on the other hand we use their Beach way more than they use their Beach but could we because there's it's kind of a mute point if they review our ordinance and aren't willing to put that in place can we ask them to review our ordinance and see if they we get Council agreement that that's something because there's no point in us spending a lot of time on this if they're not even willing to accept the ordinance as it's written or a good something similar because we're going to need that for the permit um and then what I heard Kyle say was it's about fifty two thousand dollars to do this project and and the buoys last a year to maybe three years so is that a fifty two thousand dollar a year ongoing maintenance project and if that is we have a lot of deferred infrastructure that really is vying for that money more than buoys for someone else's property and that's why I bring it to the council I'm just some just things that are going off to my head as we're talking about it so just kind of that and then um so I think before we even spend too much time thinking about budgeting it we probably should say are they going to be agreeable to the ordinance yeah yeah and that's where um I think that the uh from an official capacity uh you would be uh the better person to present that uh to uh to uh to their commission and uh you don't necessarily have to go to their meeting but I guess start with their City attorney and pass it off to her and let her look at it right okay uh see what she thinks and see if they're still interested I have a feeling that they don't boat up to their Beach I don't think that they're going to have a problem with that but I could be wrong there's a resident here tonight who brought that up uh he challenged me on that of whether they would actually go for it or not so this is where it starts and I just before we even begin this I wanted to see if this was something the council was even interested in everybody good to start just asking the question investigation how about you miss Livingstone you look like you have doubts I do I have similar concerns to our vice mayor um but if we can just look and see um as recommended then that's fine uh Mr Banker do you have the final word on this topic I think uh Bel Air shores would be very agreeable to about five buoys I don't know if they're going to be agreeable to the first of 19th Street according to what mayor Schmidt said and Mr Bloom is I think uh one of them said well I have a 53 point guard I like to bring ashore and everything like that which you could outside those martyrs uh good luck with that yeah but uh hey I like I said you did a great job from what I heard um I think the conversation should proceed okay yes sir Mr Roberts I just have a couple more questions about the maintenance part of it so let's assume we do the entire project two years down the road we're talking about doing it again but is part of that still reusable I mean so I mean there's some out there that have been there how long those buoys that are we're down to maybe four or five it was like a half one okay um and those four or five are actually still in the ground where they were there um since we're doing new markers we have to pull out the old ones because we have different signage on them right um so it'll kind of be a test to see uh how much effort it takes to break those free um when they go out there to reinstall everyone sure so again so if we put the new ones in and we're two years down the road we don't really have to change anything if some of them come loose and wash ashore we don't really have to buy a new buoy right necessarily not necessarily no so just whatever fail to allow it to come up to the shore I don't know if maybe just one of these uh you know broke loose something to that effect it's the anchors I think it's the problem right over time they start burying themselves sure and they've been in that salt water for a while and it's it's not a great mix there so I don't I guess my point is it's probably not going to be let's say we spend 27 000 initially on the Baylor Shore area and and assuming that the cost would remain the same I don't think we would spend 27 000 two years from there because we're still going to reuse some of those things if in fact they even came loose right it's more repair the ones that break rather than redo the whole system right yeah yeah what we're talking about yeah I want to check with Indian Rocks to see I think they do it more on an annual basis okay um but you wouldn't want to go like three years and start losing them and then do your three year install and then all of a sudden the rest are really yeah we could still budget for it you know so that so it recovered but you know years if we didn't have to spend all that money would carry over um you know I think just to make that assumption that it's going to be twenty seven thousand dollars it every two years or every year just for better Shores I'm not sure it's going to be that much I hope you know type of a deal so all right are they are ours drilled in or are they on a neuronic slab uh concrete a block yeah made in a tub about like maybe eight inches high up that I had pictures of them that's the that's the cheaper way to go um you can put the helical devices in um once you once it breaks free though to find it again um I wanted to when I get a quote from uh divers that do the helical if there's a way to Market out um to refined connection points so over time that's a more economical way because it's more expensive because you're not just dumping uh an acre into the water you're paying divers to actually down in there um but maybe if it's something that we're planning on maintaining over a longer stretch if it does make more sense to be able to relocate the Clearwater has pilings put in instead like a telephone pole instead of a buoy when it they'll say like okay that'll stop about um stop and vote for sure but um have we ever looked at the cost of that or uh we haven't yeah I just got the permit for the markers but I can reach back out and see if it's an option I'm just I didn't know if you had something off it top of your head you could spitball we have piles on this side yeah um yeah something to consider let's begin with the permit or or the ordinance around the ordinancy you've been interested at all and uh and I will uh I'll try to reach out to a couple of them if I can I don't know if they're sometimes they're here sometimes they're not you know they're sometimes hard to find but I'll see what I can do and any more discussion on this can we move on to item three yes we can all right everyone ready uh we're on the item three discussion to include an invocation at meetings this was placed on the agenda by council member Roberts uh you have of course so thank you sir um yeah I thought about this for a while I don't know why I didn't bring it forward sooner uh so shame on me but I did have a couple of conversations with Mr Moore I wanted to just run some ideas past them regarding some of his experiences with other cities that he works with how they handle it things like that so I got some good feedback from him but I think um Mr Mayor if we could just kind of get a feeling for how everybody else feels about doing this um and then I've got some different ideas as to how we may proceed if it looks like everybody's in favor of that Miss Notaro I think it would be a welcome addition to our meetings thank you and Mr Roberts we know where you stand this Livingstone I'm in agreement I think it's a welcome addition Ms Shirley I think it's a great idea I'm disappointed I didn't think of it Mike Sable foreign use the term invocation invocation is a summoning of a deity um whether you use God Jesus Christ which frankly not everybody believes like you religions deeply personal the reason for the United States is because the government practice religion they have a state-sponsored religion and frankly I spent a year in Iraq where the government six times a day broadcasted it a call to prayer which following that was gunshots and frankly there are over thousands of churches around here but there's only one city hall that City Hall should be for everybody not just at the Angeles you know uh Jews for example they don't read the New Testament no just first five they don't use the term God Jesus Christ is not a savior um in fact you can't use the word god it's Hashem G Etc what I'm telling you is we just got through three years of hell of people arguing enemies some have breached the lines and we've reached across to settle that but frankly I don't want to have an invocation at our meetings and I'm moving to table thank you very much Mr bankert well um I'm 100 in favor uh in our on our money it says In God We Trust um the beginning of the constitute or um when they were forming the Constitution it was in the year of Our Lord okay and I was actually saying a prayer during halfway into the sign where I said we'd have a power failure so so we could leave but um I'm 100 in favor thank you I am also uh behind this in fact I'm I'm like vice mayor Shirley why didn't I say something I I did an informal survey uh with some of the the residents uh around the city of Bellaire Beach and they were for it but afraid of it and the reason why they were afraid of it was only because they were afraid we would be sued uh and so what I did was I I just did a 10 minute search on the internet and it looks like the Supreme Court uh would back us up because it's it's considered free speech um I have been called on uh by the mayor's Council of Pinellas County twice uh to do the invocation and uh and I was very proud and honored to do it but I've also had to watch others do it and not everyone believes the same thing that I do and I respect everyone uh and and their position of of uh where they stand uh religion wise and uh I think most people that do the invocation are going to be smart enough to make it as generic as possible to where you still there's some spirituality involved but you're not trying to be offensive to others who think differently or believe different than you do I think ultimately it's it has the uh the same outcome and it uh it's a great way to start a meeting so I am 100 behind this excellent um again I did have some discussions with Mr Mora and he um assured me that he's been involved with other cities uh that do this so um a couple of what you said about going online and taking a look I think I don't see any any issues I did look um on online as well for some for lack of a better word a template which really brings the question who do we want to be um and I didn't say invocation I did say a prayer um who do we want to be involved in actually opening the meetings with a prayer and again with my conversation with Mr Moore he I would bring up some different ideas he would explain to me um his thoughts on what I was potentially recommending it seemed like the best thing for our city because there are some cities as an example that maybe have 15 churches in their city so they will invite ministers from the various churches we don't have that um so at the end of the day I felt like the best thing for us to pursue would be um the council members who wanted to participate would actually say the prayer now one thought that I had was there's there's prayer templates available out there many of them I would say but they're all equivalent and they're designed specifically for cities and counties and organizations like that so they're very careful how they I do not want to water it down um based on my beliefs at the same time I don't want to cross any lines and cause people to feel uncomfortable so what I'd like to suggest if it's okay with all of us here is to put together a template as to the prayer that would be used at our meetings with all of us knowing that you know this would just be a template um if there's certain things that are going on in the world there's certain things that are going on in our city that we believe or the person who's reading that night feels like it would be appropriate to add something else to it I think we should allow that lead Bank in there but I could put this simply together and and work with Randy to make sure he thinks it's fine and then with that document I could get that to everybody else out there to take a look at it and see what everybody's thoughts are and how so how do you guys feel about that where anybody who wanted to we would just have a schedule that said this month's meeting uh council member X will be handling the prayer so you're saying it would be the same prayer every month except if there's new yeah and there would be some leeway in there I just think it's a it's a structure to follow a lot of it is is pretty much Common Sense where we're asking for guidance and strength you know to help our city that type of a thing um so that's my thoughts let me uh go back that you said all I'm definitely against it second of all you're ostracizing me if I decide not to participate in fact talking like this I'll play The Devil's Advocate which people are starting to think oh my God he's against God said look I do it again it's deeply personal if you want to get into all that we can even talk about that if you want but again I also requested we table this and you didn't pass my motion um it's deeply divisive and you're starting to say templates again using load of terms Jesus Christ God yes we're under God in fact we say that during the Pledge of Allegiance obviously however we don't mandate a religion which you're doing by saying in Jesus Christ's name or you know in God's name what about Allah I mean Playing devil's advocate again look there's a lot of problems there and I'ma just telling you from my standpoint as a member of this Council I don't need God's permission to do anything if you're an engineer we fire Engineers that think God's good Hamlet no numbers either yes or no and again I want to table this motion okay we have a I'm sorry I did not hear you say table early on no no no however we have emotion on the table would anyone like to Second this motion or shall we continue this conversation continue the conversation all right the motion dies so please continue Mr zabel no um no it's a process so that's fine I understand thank you um going back to the mayor's Council of Pinellas County whenever they asked me uh they said you can do your own or if you'd like we can provide you with one I will be more than happy to email tomorrow to get a copy of that for you okay I will pass it off to you and you can do your thing right foreign can I just add I travel the state bullying permits in front of many cities municipalities typically requires a land use change zoning I'm in front of councils in many many cities and I think ours is the only city I've been in front of that does not have some sort of prayer at the opening of their council meeting is Food For Thought but there's also many that do not I've been to both um whenever I do a big c meeting uh we do not do the prayer uh whenever I do the mayor's Council meetings we do I also uh notice that Pinellas County does they they do a prayer at the beginning of theirs so it's it's a little all over the map but I have felt bad that we that I couldn't at least um feel better prepared at the beginning of the meeting and I I uh even though council members is able doesn't really agree I think that it sets the tone and kind of calms everybody down to be prepared for a good meeting knock on wood this is a great Council I'm very proud of all of you and uh I hope that this doesn't damage uh damage our future but I do feel very strongly about it and thank you very much for bringing it up and I'll just give you the back up on that is look I respect the council absolutely you know whatever you do I'm behind you absolutely on that but please respect my thoughts as well I'd appreciate that thank you yeah and to your point Mike I I kind of agree with the um you know assigning it council members because I can tell you I have a pretty strong opinion on my beliefs and I'm not going to water it down so that I may not be the best person to to offer you know it's my point the invitation so just In fairness right so um you know and to your point and you should that's fine yeah right uh and so um you know just think that through it's all as my only thought right and I like what you said Mr Mayor regarding when you were asked they said you could give your own or you could use one that they had in place and I think the reason why they they give you that option is because some people aren't comfortable with creating oh sure you know writing down their thoughts and and uh and and doing a public prayer whereas they probably again I've never seen it I may have heard it I wouldn't know if if it was the prepared one or someone wrote it but I'll get it and uh take a look at it and uh and you guys work on something and you know let's talk about it it doesn't require uh anything I don't I don't believe there's anything about it in our uh uh in our Charter that says we can't so uh as I've heard of the military too it's like we'll just move forward and what were you asking because we're asking Kyle to contact uh well I'm going to hand off the because I can't contact you I'm just okay guys right the uh the the the the canned uh invocation and then you can look it over and do whatever you want to with it okay just an example I got it right right okay thank you all right any other discussion on item three all right now we're on the item four how are we doing on time we have 45 minutes so we're doing doing pretty good this is discussion of holiday Lighting on Gulf Boulevard I've placed it on the agenda knowing that uh the Bellaire Beach Community Foundation uh had big plans to uh to try to fund some of this if not all of it however uh I was afraid that because they're a new organization they probably wouldn't be able to do it for at least a couple of years because it takes time to build up uh the kitty and um I've also had several residents during the holiday season that said everyone else has lights we look like a bunch of scrooches why don't we have lights here what is this and uh and so I assured everyone that that reached out to me that I would put it on a work session and do discuss it so here we are and uh Kyle would you like to give an update on uh our situation okay so I put together a map just kind of show where we're at about three months ago my staff went out and um located all the polls that had existing outlets on them and uh determined which ones actually had power still running to them which ones didn't um since then I started discussions with Duke Energy um you know telling them okay this is what we have um what I asked them what would the cost be to uh repair the ones that don't have power to them anymore um some time went by and then when I reached back out to him again I found out that they were actually in the process of repairing the ones that had Outlets that didn't have power so they took that on themselves to get power back to it um so they you know at that time they're like it should be all complete within a week um and then um so what this map shows is all the green is the existing Outlets that that were still there that they now have working um I do not know because I I can imagine there was an outlet at Fifth Street um maybe not so much definitely a 12th Street 16th Street um I don't know if over time that wear and tear that it separated um is no longer there but I reached back out I'm trying to get a price for um what what they're going to charge if we want to add some Outlets to polls because the way this map out um the bare minimum if we just kept the pattern you know you would go up to at least 25th but I think that leaves a lot of parts of the Northwest City that kind of would be a big gap um maybe I mean you could stop there I tried to draw up what would be ideal based on where the light poles were um the best spacing to sort of maintain a uniform display throughout the throughout Gulf Boulevard so that ended up getting me um we have 19 existing Outlets that we'd have to add per this plan if if it's something that you think is acceptable would be an additional 17 proposed Outlets um again I need to know from Duke Energy what they're going to cost and the other big question is um how I coincides with the undergroundy and that and that was my fear is that we would do all this planning and work and then they would undergraduates down or wreck it and the way Duke is um uh Miriam Tucker who I deal with for underground planning um you know they're all departmentalized so she has to get in touch with the lighting department um I naturally want to assume that they wouldn't go fixing all these Outlets that they're going to clean them down in months but I still don't know the exact the answer to that so I want to make sure this is what was the last part you said so they they took out themselves to repair all these Outlets that didn't have power but I just was asking you know what it would take you know would not saying that we're going to use any holiday decorations this year anytime in the near future so um I want to assume which I probably shouldn't but that they wouldn't go repair something they were gonna rip down in a matter of months right but again I need the answer for that now are is there uh or any plan at all to uh what's the goal with the street lighting what what are we just going to leave it as is and they're not going to change anything right now with the with the plan of undergrounding all the wires um they're going to top the poles and put caps on them you can have the existing wood poles which I don't have the count on me right now I think it is uh there was probably only nine poles that were going to go away that didn't have street lights on them and then the rest you know you're looking at 80 85 90 wooden poles with the lights staying um tops so that they're shorter um there's been discussion and pricing on solar but the problem with the solar is the arms on them are not as long so you're going to have to put the solar lights a lot closer to the roadway which can pose a problem plus currently right now we do all the solar maintenance in the city and maintaining solar lighting on Gulf Boulevard is a little different than 22nd Street and Lolita have we asked Duke I know we're getting on another subject but for the cost to replace those light poles with concrete poles or metal poles as part of our street light plan and what that might look like um I did it's usually a lease agreement it is um to go for the last number they gave me to go from a wooden Pole to a concrete post um it was to add a concrete pole was that what didn't exist with 7 000 and I think the replacement was four thousand to go from wood with the existing light so it's still and we know what that lease looks like to I mean just just food for thought let's let's kind of look at like some options on street light plans for after undergrounding what that looks like because that's exactly where I was going I don't want to invest all this money to you know fixtures do Christmas decorations for two years and then we rip it all out and have to redo it instead of having 19 poles we end up with I don't know 10. yeah I I'm uh definitely all for uh lighting the place up but also those decorations are not cheap no they are very have you priced they priced from about 500 to a thousand dollars depending so with the with the number we're looking at if we kept what we have existing we're looking at about 20 000 or we add as many to expand the city we're looking at about 36 000 in the lighting it's it's a major commitment so if we do this we definitely want to go across Causeway right let me have a bucket truck there install these we always run a lift out we only have how many personnel should be two full-time yeah hopefully this week I will pass all the employee screening for the new hire on the uh Community Services administrator okay yeah well um I guess what we need is more information on undergrounding and what what's really going to happen I think it's too soon to commit to anything as far as the the lighting goes obviously there's a plan to that will help us get electricity but if it's just temporary and we decide to change things out uh we in in a future work session I think we should uh we should decide and discuss or discuss and decide whether we do want to do something with these polls and it's just too bad Pinellas County couldn't have given us more money you know you can still asked yeah I heard that yeah that would be nice all right um again this was just a it's not really an action item it was just a discussion but uh hopefully this will give us something that we can go back through our last 50 months and say hey we're talking about it and uh uh we're still trying to work out a plan all right next up uh council member zabel put uh let's see converting to park mobile or other mobile parking app uh take it away Mike's able sure um we looked at parking and uh we thought you know my preliminary thought was can we save money by removing all these signs as I was saying okay sign maintenance wait crew placement we have maintenance of the parking meters uh with something Park Mobile which actually cities tour left and a right Inland used Park Mobile and it's very easy because frankly all the accountants now removed from in-house to an external agency that does all the the counting for you and people are used to it they know how to use it uh the police force our sheriffs they know how to use it and going through the numbers they're fairly conservative you know there is some minimal savings at least with parkmobile uh there's additional savings with another company but the one thing that stuck out was the cost to maintain the parking meters that's done by our city manager um I think you're talking five hours a month minimum to maintain repair and the problem comes in when you don't have a repair part you got to trace it down look the object is we hired him he's doing a great job but he needs to get out of the job of parking maintenance man and that's why I brought this up we talked to well two companies and the numbers so far they they work out to again if no savings there is a minimal savings or could be more from going to these companies with that idea but the big savings comes in no longer having to maintain um the parking machines uh Kyle what was your thought because like I said we would back forward on this you'll see some of the emails so yeah if you look at um our costs of parking meter maintenance it's under the um departmental um and if you look at the actual um sorry I still have the Belgian in front of you the uh the actual first for last uh for 20 to 21 budget year was 16 283. um what was that what made it what made up that number uh that was subscription fees um Parts upgrades for the meters um periodically they upgrade the uh the networks that they run on so we had to upgrade the modems um ongoing Parts Program that's where um it involves the time [Music] I can give you a breakdown of the individual costs um but with the Parts Program it's beneficial because your recycling Parts but it still involves the time of every time something breaks you have to troubleshoot it you have to go from one meter to the other and you have to drive the park to get it swapped out which is in uh off of Ulmerton by uh by uh 49th Street and we spent what sixteen thousand on that for maintenance slashing that's the cost of the maintenance fees that's not including the time and involved yeah that was 2021 was the 16. and was that the modem year uh yes and did we buy the modems we did yeah we owned the machine so I don't expect that to happen again but and just curious 21 to 22 is 15 924 and I can break these down but okay we're not budgeting enough money okay for what we're spending and uh how much are we bringing in 164 000. how many hours is that would anybody what I'm saying is what I'm looking at it it's going to cost 68 cents an hour to go with Park mobile now we're paying 60. you know what I'm saying I'm paying 16th out the savings here is they're going to right into our cost I agree you know yeah briefly the looks we did was it doesn't it's very you know and if at all it's minimal so it was about 10 or 8 meter expense was right around sixteen thousand but you're also paid for credit card use on the years for every hour right okay somebody else yeah giving you some actual live numbers but here's the thing is the mirror talked earlier and it's a really good point sometimes we don't want the people to park here and what you do and unknown these are outsides inside you got your parking pass you're good you're free to park anywhere you want obviously you don't violate the laws but for these outside people you can at the touch of a button change the rates you can increase rates for holidays you can back them off a little bit for a weekend you can basically afford to charge outside people more and it's a basically it's an economic decision do you want to park here do you want to go to the beach okay well it's going to cost you X for the parking um but again going back to it it's the biggest Saver in all of this is Kyle's time and we all agree that we value his time and his staff's time and that's one less thing that we can remove which is an immediate savings and still provide the parking and maintain the income that we've been basically kind of banking them on now no matter what service we choose whether we stay with uh with who we're with now or if we move forward with Park Mobile I would not expect Kyle to do this because it's now the city manager well he'll replace whoever he hires they receive responsible for this I agree definitely so fifteen thousand dollars what's that it's about eighteen thousand dollars worth of salary at five five it was it five hours a week you said or a month sorry a month okay so it's a lot of money um and time and time is everything in this job and now we understand what you're doing now into your replacement plus you got to train the replacement et cetera this is not the only company in frankly we don't have full-blown estimates we want to get this again just like we're talking everything else tonight into the discussion so we can go ahead and dig you know more into that and then bring the companies in going okay here's our typical thing what are you coming forward and is there a competitive offer so you can really do see the numbers involved um and that's really the the critical decision point so you can see okay are we going to lose money are we going to stay even you know perhaps make more I I mean my preliminary numbers yeah they look fine but you gotta really get them in here and what's really nice is at least the two agent well we know one agency already has the contract for the area so it's just a matter of tying on to Clearwater's contract uh to go forward and frankly their infrastructure just assigns and I believe they paid for the science the uh the initial setup at the check yeah we gotta check but hey it's again we're starting to look at this and thought this would be a good you know thought process going forward uh would anyone like to speak on this topic well if you take the 145 000 that we brought in and divide that by five dollars an hour and you'd take 16 68 cents it's going to cost us nineteen thousand nineteen thousand seven hundred dollars to go with Park Mobile and we're paying six sixteen thousand now and we're probably spending about 1500 to 2 000 for labor to maintain it so you're going to be so you're so you're you're we're gonna it's gonna cost probably about eighteen hundred dollars you're going to be off why is we are also charging credit card fee because they're using credit cards on this machine that's where really the fee is uh with parkmobile and I added all that in 68 cents an hour so look quite good on both sides can I get that's what yeah yeah let me give you a little history and then I will uh continue to call on everyone uh uh vice mayor Shirley probably remembers this um one of the things that we are able to accomplish with our meters is that we put a cap on how much time uh someone can be on the beach okay all right so uh if you're if you switch to Park Mobile you can't do that yes you can well so it just won't let them it it won't let them renew it gives you a match yeah yeah okay all right there are Park Mobile jurisdiction and jurisdiction you can vary even within zones within a jurisdiction some of their some zones you can't renew some all of them have a cap for example as you come through Clearwater um down Myrtle the main roadway if you're parking for eight minutes or less it's no charge then it's an hour minimum after that okay and you can only park I think that's up to like three hours or something or four hours so you do have the ability with that contractor to and this would be if we did this this would be the only one that I would even consider because it's already on my phone and then I don't know what happens with I think the credit card charge probably doesn't pass through the city because you have an app and it's already loaded right through the uh yeah so I I had a um quickly uh I don't know if anyone's here from hibiscus yeah that had a had a comment uh there were two people I think they were talking about I I did receive one that said uh let's see here disagree with parking app at Bel Air Beach Marina but I don't know why she she didn't State why so uh anyway other comments it just seems like how many parking places do we have there or how many or we have this building Bayside Park Morgan parking tall parking spaces and all the all the locations I think they say the marina can to 70 maybe more Morgan Park I would say is like probably 30 something 34 and then here out here is maybe 15 16. okay and this is 50 2. the handicap it's a real convenient app to use if you haven't yeah I've used it around other cities um I don't know just a gut feel it just seems like you know I get clear water I mean I can't even imagine how many you know parking spaces they have where people pay for we're just we're just kind of small so um how long have we had those machines first one oh okay this first one was Bayside that's meter one um and the second was the marina the the newest one is here and that was in 2018. Morgan I think was routine 10 and 15. so the oldest one's got to be probably like oh six I can get the I can get those numbers I think the other opportunity it lends itself to is people if you're on the beach you may not get up and put money back in the machine and chances of getting ticketed are pretty slim whereas if you have the app and you get a notice that your time's up I think will collect more money because of the convenience of paying through a mobile app you tend to provide too because yeah you can you can't get the refund right put in four hours you paid for four hours right well it's the same with machine though I think what's the only thing that we're really missing here is the math right and and yeah this is uh I I don't have a problem with uh with with taking a serious look at this uh listen to their presentation and looking at the the hard numbers and seeing if it's actually worthwhile to do it I want to switch um others going back to what you said in the vice mayor I mean the idea was I'm not going to go back to the meter and put the money in I'm just packing up and leaving right now what would we now do so yeah what they're saying is that it expires yeah and then you can't renew yeah but then so now we're going to say you're going to be on the beach for two hours three hours you know what I'm saying because you can't renew there's what's time with time limit would we be telling people uh you know what I'm saying yeah yeah because really you don't want to say that I know you don't want to say it but I don't think with you and in the entire city is what I was saying threshold of Economics yeah I think we can quickly adjust the numbers easily through an app program too we can make that adjustment quick and say oh well this weekend's a holiday weekend that's Jack that price up because we know people are coming to the beach and make more money I mean it's taxing our staff and at least everything is getting taxed on those very trying weekends can't work with us out they know how to check who's in who's yeah they should be able to log in and see all the plates that are paid stickers you're the one who deals with it more than anybody what do you think my thought I just wanted to hear if there were any major objections of to not allowing cash payments anymore well that would eliminate it right that would eliminate having that they either have the app and pay for it yeah or they don't they have to download the app I've been stuck in that situation and I'm like okay I've got this app but I forgot my password and I'm trying and I set up you know yeah and then you uh and then you uh register your husband's truck right instead of your car what are the fun I didn't bring up it's the way of the future I don't know if Howard I don't like having a lot of cash here and that's where we're at right now we're running a bank I mean you start talking pushing a hundred thousand through and you're pushing a lot of that in cash back there Vice here no cash nobody's attempting no accounting so what was your comment though your comment was about the cash payments I mean we have an older community but most you know this in this area they're mostly residents with stickers uh I just I didn't know um how you felt the reaction would be to to eliminate being able to pay with cash okay but I do believe it's where everything's going is that allowed that you don't you have to have some kind of an Avenue since the dollar bill it says there's no is used for currency uh for all debts public and private uh so what I'm saying is do you have to give a cash option some point no in as much as the the question is a legal one I'm not I'm not aware of that as a requirement per se in all government well I'm just saying that what it says no I understand I understand that it says this is legal tender I'm familiar with the same provision I can also identify numerous governmental functions in which you are unable to pay with cash or coins um and so I'm not that it were that the case it'd be hard for me to conceive that it's that omnipresent at this stage um Park and even because some government facilities parking and the like I'm happy to look into it but I'm I've not heard anything to that effect or seen some judicial opinion that binds all government to require acceptance of cash for all forms of IRS if that was the case uh then uh city of Saint Pete city of uh Clearwater uh Washington DC everyone would if everybody's okay uh say we uh allow him to move forward provide us with some real numbers and uh and we have one more discussion and bring somebody in is that that okay yeah all right okay uh uh item six it is 20 till nine this one may take a while we've we've gone down this road before started okay briefly there's a waiting list for Marina use and there's two types of people there's resident I'm going to use that term resident and resident and non-resident owners and basically everybody else somebody lives in Clearwater wants to park their boat here and currently if you're on the list if you do not have a vote that matches that size say and I'm just going to use this quick example you got a 20 foot boat and it's a 40 foot slip well you don't qualify so it goes to the next person I just want to change that to give that person an option much as you not required to own a boat right now when you request it I want the same option to apply it to somebody in the city going if I have a 20-footer and I'm next on the list please contact me and give me the option to either accept it and buy a bigger boat you had no choice in this you can't park that 24th you got to use what we have accept it by that bigger boat and I'll have that bigger boat parked in you know three months I'm gonna go get a sale or say I'm not getting a bigger boat therefore I can't accept this lot so it goes to the next person on the list you know next um again I I'm gonna say Bel Air Beach person uh but it gives them the option to upsize that they're next on the list I'm just trying to you know hit that because in some cases we're seeing that a person in Bellaire Beach resident has a 20-footer and because they don't meet the big 40-foot that they're passed over without being notified we just I want to give them a shot to upgrade the boat and take that slot how many people are on the wait list right now do you know yes um you know it's been a big number yeah I mean this this was brought up to maybe a a resident that uh was passed over and he said well if I would have known I would have bought a bigger boat which is so we have 80 right 84. um we have 29 uh the way the waiting list Works currently is you just have to own property um to be on the top part of the list um to be considered first so you have 29 Property Owners 55 who do not own property in belar Beach and the way that the ranking goes currently is um you get ranked highest if you're if the boat you plan to put in that slip is the longest so if if you have a um a 33 foot boat let's say number two on the list another property owner of belar beach comes has a 38-foot boat they want to put in they're going to jump you on the list so I guess to Mike's Point why don't we offer to the next guy on the list and say this is the cost for the slip I don't care how big you go this is you know if it's a 55 foot slip and we charge a dollar a foot and 55 you know whatever it's you know just for Simplicity uh that's the price for the slip I don't care how big is the limiting factor on the slips are the are the beam distance so most you know everything has a lot of room behind it so you could if you're charging my foot um as long as you're if you got a narrower sailboat but it's long um it's hard to say exactly what the maximum is for that slip because the maximum is limited by the width okay but you were just saying a 33 foot boat so I was just okay doing a good you know a good comparison if there's a slip for a 33 foot boat and I'm on the list next with a 20-foot boat okay call me and say this is the price to rent this slip are you interested or not and that's based on what that slip will allow not based on my boat so you're saying they we find that the biggest boat that could fit in that slip that we currently have the on the list person on the list the next person on the list it's not Jody and she's got a 20-foot little Runabout right yeah Jody here's the price I mean not the slip isn't defined by the length though it's defined by so I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out how to how to say how much the the she's got a Chinese the thing is Big okay but let's apply that after this slip number 10 can accommodate a 30 to a 40-foot boat we put a price tag on that slip whatever that is I mean maybe we need to look at that pricing for those people that are waiting and as the slips turn you know clearly people that are in the spots already they have their price they're they worked into that schedule we did a few years ago and you know they're in place but anyone knew but trying to accommodate our property owners if we have how many slips do we have that are rented by non-property owners do we have any so so resident Property Owners nine slips rented um non-resident property owners six slips rented and then non-property owners are down to three okay so those three probably should get a notice that they have six months to move their boat so we can accommodate our property ownership at those rates at whatever great schedule we set up but I mean the marinas for our residents not for as much as I love it being a profit center it's really for a residents not for non-residents great our property based on the length of the vote or Bank based on the length of the slip the length of the boat in the slip currently the length of the boat the length of the boat is what we charge now yeah right so even if it's a 40-foot slip and have a 20-foot boat we're only charging them for the 20-foot boat correct last of all currently there's a minimum um the fee schedules laid out in the last resolution they wouldn't qualify for that 40-foot slip right they wouldn't be paying enough based on the uh the the footage correct of the slip yeah clarify what you're saying are you saying that we should be charging one set price for a slip that can accommodate a 40-foot boat and one that should accommodate 20 people just don't want us to pass over a resident but we have a snip so that might be a complicated and we've got someone in the audience I can tell you how to do it yeah you would have a what we consider a minimum and a maximum footage okay for that slip so let's say it accommodates uh 25 to 35 feet well your boat's 20 feet well you get the minimum the minimum which will be 25 and then hey then put your boat in there but you're paying for five extra feet if you want it and what happens typically I'd rent the slip and I'd go buy a lift and I put it in there and so that maybe the beam maybe it allows a beam of a 14 foot you know beam or something ridiculous I would size it down to accommodate my my boat no it's the same Theory as a single person buying a 4 000 foot square home he's going to be paying the taxes you know it is so I mean the slip can accommodate as mayor said 25 to 35 feet you charge them at least the minimum regardless if he wants to put a row boat in there I agree that we should charge on the length of the slip regardless of what you as your boat owner the renter wants to put in there that's not my problem right you want to put a tiny little belt in there no I'm running I'm running with you yeah the way I wrote was not like this but I this was an idea yeah I mean I'm with you and we should do everything we can to accommodate the residence I mean I'd rather see them take it yeah but their pain in it yes I'm gonna if you want to address the council just come on up yeah since you uh have an interesting I appreciate it gentlemen ladies I um I'm the reason for this coming up on the on the agenda I'm Jonathan Viola 107 First Street everybody's been very helpful and I appreciate it thank you um I came from a neighborhood so I bought a house here 10 years ago 11 years ago didn't realize Kyle's been great he'd let me know that I could have been on that list 10 years ago but I didn't consider myself a resident even though I bought the home so now I move in a year and a half ago said okay now now I can get on the list find out I'm at number 16 let's say well this year and correct me if I'm wrong Kyle not trying to get anybody in trouble here but I moved down from 16th to 24th on the list because people had bigger boats than I did not knowing that I just went to the Tampa Boat Show I'll buy a 35-foot boat if I can have a slip to put it in my boat's 24 feet right now so I'm a resident willing to take any slip pay any money to get in that slip for convenience however I get you guy I understand from other neighbors there's been a lot of time poured into this subject so rather than reinvent the wheel I came from a neighborhood that had 40 slips and 40 homes and the neighbors worked very well together in shuffling it was sort of first in last out type of deal and we had the exact issue that you're talking about where some slips were larger than others some people came in they were new homeowners they had bigger boats than people that had smaller boats and we worked it all out by the first and last out and what happened this was very complicated and I don't suggest this but we had a review every year that basically said if you want to move your slip these people are moving out of the neighborhood the new people come in they get last choice and that's just how the list worked and it worked very well and everybody knew that a year from now their boat fit their slip but if a bigger slip came open they got they were next in line it was same same Theory and I'm not trying to get complicated here but you shouldn't be able to go backwards on the wait list it's last in you know last out first in same way a wait list always works the issue is when it's my turn if I don't want to take that slip or can't afford that slip then I'm happy to pass it on to the number two person but if I'm next in line and a guy comes in from wherever and has a 40 foot boat he shouldn't be able to jump me in line I mean that just makes no sense so that's sorry to make it more complicated I hope it didn't confuse you even more but no actually it makes perfect sense thank you very much for speaking thank you for taking the time I feel for him I really do and I I think if I could just put this out there one man slip size fees the discussions on the marina we can do this every couple years I I like it coming up right now as you're doing the comprehensive plan and start looking at really incrementally do we just want to make another decision or are we or do we have a big city plan with what we want to do with that first secondly I've always said if you just took a blank slate down there that's where you get the decision of boy do we do what we've always done with a by foot or do we really look at it reconfigure it and charge by the size of the slip unfortunately we have people down there so you're kind of caught in that middle ground this piece I don't think is fair so there's something that has to be done that allows the list to prioritize maybe even residents which goes back to the comprehensive plan talk should we have a marina that's not even for outside and phase that out should we limit number of boats or slips you can have should we talk about maybe the slip sizes again it's really an interesting subject but it starts with a little pain on someone who's watching themselves go from 16 to 24. I know I waited seven years I didn't move backwards on the list I know that for a fact so um I don't you're always welcome to ask me questions about competitive pricing what have you but I think he's got a legitimate beef thanks guys thank you I mean here he's been in a resident for 10 years I really think we should be looking at somebody that's invested in this community for 10 years or five years or 20 years and then buys a boat somebody just Moves In Here wash your day go on the list you know what I'm saying he he should get some grandfather yeah that's what we're trying to do yeah just rewriting this but I mean he's just a surprise yeah and it's and there's definitely some problems it's it's hard to ask someone to leave whenever you've you've told them hey you can keep your boat here even though they're uh maybe not a resident you know but there are uh certain things that I've I've always felt very strongly about that we should look at definitely um I think a non-resident should be the absolute Last Resort before a resident and whenever I say resident I don't mean rental home owners I don't mean people that that invest in property and they don't and they live over in Tampa I'm talking about people that live here in Bel Air Beach and that's what's on their driver's license yeah they should take first priority and they should always be at the top of the list and the only reason why anyone not living here should be in that Marina at all is because it's such a bad slip that nobody wants it but uh also I I have a problem with uh with more than one vote if there's more than one if you have more than one boat well one's all that's the only spot you get is one not not more than one and I think we have that case right now is that right yeah technically the title is under different names same household that neither lives here is that right let's just don't know the exact legal background a definitely look okay yes that's nuts yeah well my point is is that uh if if we had a Firm Stance on you must live here that wouldn't happen at all so um obviously there's some uh discussion that's that's going to be happening uh with with the long-term strategy of our city and uh I I look forward to their recommendations and then we can put our own spin on it and maybe come up with something that um will accommodate the the residents and not make them wait so long unfortunately you've you have the it's full and it's hard to do this shuffling around whenever it's time to make rule changes uh we just watched it at the Clearwater Yacht Club and uh they got all new dogs all new slips everything's brand new there and it was an absolute nightmare for all the boaters because they had to find homes to put their docks you know in private uh you know private docks they were begging their neighbors and their friends for just letting me keep my boat here for a few months and I I think some of them are still not there because they're still working on Power and things like that uh so it's it's not easy and uh and you won't be the most popular person if we go changing what we already have but I think it's something that definitely we need to we need to continue thinking about and talking about until we can come up with some workable solution that we're all happy with and like Mr bankert says we put the residents at the top of the list not number 27. I am so sorry that happened to you thank you but um yeah I'm recommending though in the meantime because I mean we kind of grind kind of slowly which is good I mean we analyze review um can we rapidly change it so that the existing people don't get jumped if we change it can he get back to 16 instead of 24 you know well I'm just saying I mean that's what we should be looking at yeah it's because it's this section right here about how the wine stuff that we can just change that now obviously everything else is long scope and we'll work on a comprehensive plan but for now you know just addressing the line skipping part of it and I like you know and vice mayor's idea where you say no you're not required to buy the boat you're required to pay whatever right yes absolutely and then if you don't well the wife says no okay then you lose you go to the next day her husband says no can I just add a couple of things I guess so we can move forward because we don't have any information it's back to right that has some some hard numbers some actual numbers of current doc situation and then also what the waiting list looks like and I think from what you just said we've got three residents that are three renters that are not property owners in the city at least we can talk about that at a council meeting and maybe bring uh how are we going to handle those three to the Forefront and anyone that's a non-resident should we even bother with them on a wait list what's the point get rid of the non-property owned or non-resident list just have the property owner at Bellair Beach residence on that wait list period there's no need to shuffle them around and have them on a wait list that they're never going to get a spot anyway um and then we once we start accumulating the information we can start talking about dock prices and that sort of thing I don't believe this is something comprehensive the comprehensive plan will cover they they're talking about zoning and things like that I mean clearly they don't get involved with a stock prices correct there there is a future vision of what the Marina has met there's there is a section that talks about it that'll be up to you to push that and drive it yeah that's that's because I don't he's referring to uh uh basically a facelift of the uh of the marina and saying that it'll uh I can't remember the exact wordage do you remember saying it will keep the uh the I don't remember the verbiage that the there was a I mean there was a uh Planning and Zoning meeting where they've begun the process of workshopping comp plan amendments um a comp plan as a constitution for Land Development and you start with policies and objectives in your comp plan policies and objectives like recreational elements like the city remains committed to preserving the residential character of its and preserving all parks and recreational blah blah blah and so there was some discussion about um within the Planning and Zoning Board of inserting language to a policy to strongly favor the permanent retention of that Marina and like and have a policy that the city intends to and remains interested in maintaining a marina for the use of its natural resources by its res dot dot dot something along those lines the general concern being that that some future commission or or body may look to just say you know we can turn that into a Starbucks or something and eliminate this this Marina and have it be a comp plan element don't break that up thank you for that information um there was just a broad statement it doesn't it's an objectives right I see some objectives I mean I've seen that form decision making where our comp plan set are um storm water you know cost to repair a storm water was a few thousand dollars and it wasn't it was 300 000 or 3 million or whatever it was the section they were focusing on so it was a very broad statement it didn't give details which is what I'm going to assume is going to be yeah so what they're considering in the planning zoning is is if they want to get more details or offer up more of a vision for that property so it's just what they've been discussing so again you'll be the one driving that because we can't participate in those meetings right okay so uh do we have any action items on this one agenda item at this time one person could participate kind of like when I got with Kyle and we worked on the financial another deal so worried about that I don't know I took a stab at this uh I believe two years ago and um I came up with some what I thought were acceptable policies and uh and it went nowhere it just uh uh there were people that were friends with the outside renters and they it was just a a lot going on and uh but I I did hand it off to Kyle uh as just something a very very high level draft and I don't know if you if you read it or not what I sent you and uh and it was kind of a starting point uh I I wouldn't have a problem continuing on it and working with you a little bit and just making some suggestions as a draft and then we could bring it to the council and then just talk about it I don't have a problem with that and I'd like to revise mine to basically Echo what vice mayor said so and I could send that back up to Kyle as well okay well there's a couple of things then and uh look at that 904. not bad we have a general business okay well I just I was just thinking uh if we were talking in the media um if you guys could I mean you kind of said um you wanted me you want the wait list the residents that live here to get to the top also said that um you thought it was Fair um more so in the order that they got on the list determine their rank so there are there are adjustments I'll have to do some validation of of the people who are the Property Owners on the top of a list to determine who was resident who is not but there are some immediate adjustments that I can make um because I do have all the dates that they got on the list and I could and they can determine that's like I'm just saying in the immediate future so that we do move with something of what your patient is yeah and I I would be all for uh even if we have to allow some non-residents in there uh I would like to establish a time limit so as to the the clock starts ticking and we can work then we know there's more slips that will eventually open up between property owners and residents because someone was saying you know somebody lives owns in Tampa but they rent their place out here who comes are they a property owner or does the person who rents their house here come ahead or are they on the same thing they brought that up yeah the renter as someone who is here in Bel Air B they could not be treated any different than someone who lives here and owns property in Bellaire Beach I don't I don't see how about the guy who owns the place that the renter is renting no I don't think I don't think that they should be uh they should take priority just because they own rental homes do we have that situation going on condos no no we do have we do have that situation and then it makes me question do we do we treat the renter who may only have a year lease different than the owner and resident well if they if they actually made it through the list and they were and then their lease went out the next year and it just opens up the slip again but I wouldn't have a problem with there are I'm sure there's people here that have rented for years and they just continue to live here in Bel Air Beach and they pay uh they they don't pay property taxes but they do everything else and they contribute to our society tonight this is your last one too you know that right I hate to push myself to the top of the list but shouldn't the people that live here and own here and pay the taxes and bought the house and like like I should be ahead of the guy that either lives here and rents or owns a house here and rents to someone else or I mean I'm the guy paying the most money to be here so shouldn't I get priority absolutely yeah absolutely thank you is there any way you can manipulate this thing and get him back to 16. are there any anybody else that got to keep on I mean okay what I want to do is I'll go through the 29 I'll validate who's a resident who lives lives here owns as a place or distinguishes between that and a renter who doesn't own the place kind of figure out where our numbers are and our property owners and then uh rearrange I can rearrange the list and we can based on that and we can look at where it ends up I don't I don't foresee a slip opening in the next time right yeah if one does we'll make it a crisis excuse me guys let's uh stay on track here just for about two more minutes do we have any other items we'd like to discuss on this uh going back to the marina right quick and now we're at General business no I said nine o'clock it's 908 uh do I have a motion to adjourn motion second second all in favor aye any opposed all right everyone thanks a lot for your hard work Frank I thought this was a snake or something I wanted to exercise yeah it's got to be mounted all the way through everything's tight everything's tested"
