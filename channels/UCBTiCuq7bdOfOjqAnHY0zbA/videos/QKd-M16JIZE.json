    "transcript": "all right citizen comments are closed before we continue I'm going to need a motion uh to adopt Ordinance 23-7 do I have a motion so Move Motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts vice mayor Shirley you have the floor uh I think our City attorney did a pretty good job explaining it I have nothing more to add any other questions or comments from the council just just a comment I would like to commend um Mr MOA on this we discussed this a lot during the last work session and trust me please when I tell you that understanding and having this thing flow is not easy and he did a fantastic job of tying everything together on these various ordinances I went through it initially when we first started talking about this and went home and said I think I'm just going to figure out how this is going to work and after 17 tries I finally decided I'm just going to let him worry about it so he did a fabulous job on this and I think the three people that actually come up with the three seats in 25 are myself and vice Mayors and Mr Z seat yes 25 that's right thank you but yeah so great job I second that any other questions or comments no all right I'm going to uh just uh go ahead and spell it out for those of you that are not aware of it we did um I I actually did a survey of all of the municipalities in um penel County and come to find out we were one of the smallest municipalities with the most members uh we were we were compared with lgo we were compared with St Petersburg um there it really just didn't make sense uh between that and also the fear that we would not have enough candidates in each election this makes perfect sense so now that I've spoken as anyone would anyone else like to comment on this no all right Patty let's take it to a vote please council member bankard no council member Livingstone yes council member Noto no council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley I mayor gavis I so it passes four to two that is the first reading and it is approved thank you Mr Mayor uh the next ordinance on the agenda is ordinance number 23-8 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of sections 2.02 2.04 and 5.05 of the charter to increase the term of office for individual council members including the mayor from 3 years to four years and to amend the regular election schedule to accommodate such terms identifying issue to appear on said ballot providing for the adoption of ballot Language by resolution providing for publication in accordance with law and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance number 23-8 by title only just as I did with the previous one I'll read the proposed ballot language that would accompany this it is the title is increasing term of office from three years to four years and the language is shall the city amend the charter to provide that each individual term of office for City Council Members including the mayor shall be for four years as opposed to the existing three-year term beginning with the officials elected in 2024 and amend the regular election cycle to accommodate the longer election terms um so that's the ballot language I want to I do think it's worth looking at the precise language that's been added here I'm not going to read it chapter and verse but I will tell you this was the most involved of the proposed amendments for a few reasons I think that your points were well taken during the work session that if we move to a four-year schedule but stay on four-year terms but stay on the current election cycle what would happen is we would have an election in in March 2024 those people would serve for four years so they would serve till 2028 if this passed and was approved by the voters and then the next cycle would be 2025 and go for four years so they would serve till 2029 so if we didn't change anything we would have an election in 2025 then nothing in 26 nothing in 27 and then again in 28 rapid fire two two new votes 28 29 and then again for these gaps and so there was a concern articulated by the by the council um or at least by some members of the council during the work session that that should that we should keep those staggered terms and so this ordinance accomplishes both changing the language from three years to fouryear terms which is a simple uh Amendment you see that in 2.04 for example for the mayor um and um but what it does is in 2.02 says that commencing with the 2024 election if this passes at the 2024 election whoever wins for the seats that are vacant with the exception of the vacancy being filled for Mr Z's seat which we can address separately but excuse me the regular term seats that are up for election in 2024 if this passes would serve until 2028 if it fails they'll stay right on schedule for their three-year term so the vote voters are simultaneously electing who would serve and how long they'll serve on for for that term um at the March election if if this passes this Council um and then again the election cycle is altered so that we would go as as suggested earlier 2024 then the positions that are scheduled in in 2025 would move to 2026 whenever we have an election in 2026 again because I couldn't presume that the ballot measure for November versus March elections would pass and so you would go to 2026 and then that way again it would go 24 26 28 30 so every two years you will have an election with this with this change and avoid those larger gaps in between and again it'll do be that 32 32 cycle um discussed a moment ago so that's how this is contemplated to to work happy to answer any questions Council I will say that it makes perfect sense as long as you don't explain it to us I mean listen I will tell you as as as convoluted as that may have seen your poor city manager sat in the conference room where I did this all on a dry eras board and figured it out um it is more involved uh you know and that is at your request based on some of the feedback given last time there's cleor simpler ways that just says three to four but then you don't think of the consequences of it and and um it's cleaner but it's not necessarily the result you want big picture all right well let's go to the citizens for comments on this particular ordinance 23-8 any citizen comments no you will be tested on your way out to make sure you understand For You Mr Kelly all right seeing there are no citizen comments they are now closed I'm going to need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-8 so moov motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you so the other day I turned on my television I have spectrum and so it defaults the B news n and then I'm immediately going to change it to the station I really wanted to watch and as Bay news9 came they said we're not going to talk about the changes that the city of Tampa is now going through with the voting so I said I listen to that they were doing exactly this and the Met of it really is they wanted to change their elections to be in November which we're going to talk about later of um the same years that we have the general election for our country and the midterms they wanted to do that for a couple reasons number one is going to save them a lot of money by doing it just those times um I won't be you with the detail on that but important was the turnout they had statistics that said when had elections the same time as the general election um they had like a 65% turnout the elections that were not tied to either the general election or the midterms they have like a 177% turnout and I think that makes sense people come out for those larger elections so that's really what we're trying to do for is to try to get our elections tied in in the November election of even years just for that so in order to do that this is one of those things that need to be changed we're on a four-year term if we're on a three-year term obviously you're only going to be on odd numbers even if you start the first year on an even number three years later you're automatically in an odd then you go back to an even doesn't work so that that's the main reason we want to do this thank you Mr Roberts for totally ignoring Mr MOA on sticking to the topic but I felt I felt the same way that these two have to be for it to make sense why would we want to you know extend the terms why do we want every two years uh specifically so that we can line up with a presidential and midterm elections uh any other uh comments or questions from the Council on one no all right Patty can we take a roll call please council member Banker no council member Livingstone yes council member Noto no council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley hi mayor gtis hi and so first reading passes 4-2 ordinance 238 and and uh Mr Moore do you have something to add about that one um not about that one but I'm prepared to add to9 um ordinance 2309 is an ordinance of the city council of the city of Beller Beach Florida submitting to the city electors a referendum question on the amendment of section 5.05 of the charter to adjust the regular election cycle from March to November contingent on the passage of a separate Ballance ballot measure governing the duration of council member terms identifying the issue to appear on said ballot providing for the adoption of ballot language W resolution providing for publication in accordance with the law and providing for an effective day this has been a reading of ordinance number 23- 09 by title only as I've done with the the two previous I'd read the ballot language uh proposed ballot language here that will be before you next meeting um Charter amendment number four conditionally aligning local election cycle with federal election cycle in November if a majority of the city's electors approve an amendment extending council member terms to four years shall the city also amend the charter to provide that its regular local elections for Council Members shall be held in November in general alignment with the federal election Cycles as opposed to the existing requirement that regular local elections occur in March yes to amend the provision no to retain um I I I appreciate your admonition to Mr Roberts I will tell you that the in draft these there was a challenge in understanding that the way that you folks had talked about this these were linked one of the explicit directions I was given at our work session was we don't really care about having our elections in November if we can't get our election Cycles changed in a way to these even numbered four-year terms such that we could stay on that same November cycle um but when I asked do you want it to work both ways the answer was no we don't want them to be each contingent just contingent one way and so that's how this was that's how this was written it is very I think clear to the voters that number four is conditional on the passage of number three if number three fails number four is going to fail no matter what the vote is um but it still needs to have a passing vote um to to be approved and so uh other other than that that the the in terms of the body of attorney 309 you can see 5.0 the the language in 5.05 says beginning with the regular election be held in 2026 uh so it would be very very clear that beginning with the regular election be held in 2026 on the next on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November um then this would happen I can write this like that because we're only doing this if we move to four years so we already know in the four-year ordinance um where or the four-year ballot language we are extending the terms of a few seats so that they would extend all the way into November 2026 we're into 2026 um I know it's a little convoluted I'm sorry um it's the only way you can make all of that work but basically if you if the voters approve the four-year term and they approve this then the first time you have an election the the very next election after the March 2024 election will be in November 2026 right um that will be the Gap you'll jump no March 2025 no November 2025 no March 26 November 2026 will be your next election where they to approve everything and so the people elected in 2024 will serve till 2028 and the people elected in 2026 will serve until 2030 and every four years thereafter if it is approved by this Council and the voters thank you for explaining that Mr MOA let's go to the citizens for comments any citizen like to make a comment no all right citizen comments are now closed I need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-9 so motion made by Lloyd Roberts do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts once again you have the floor yeah I think I cheated last time and kind of already talked about this somewhat so pretty self-explanatory we just want to um get on the fouryear cycle and that's why we want to do that any other questions or comments no all right Patty would you please call the rooll council member Banker no council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley hi mayor guus I so ordinance 23-9 first reading is approved uh the vote was 521 right now we are on to item number 14 consideration of ordinance 23-10 uh this is a first reading Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-10 an ordinance of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida amending section 38- 87 of the city's code of ordinances governing the permitting process for special events Associated costs and fees and potential penties for unpermitted or non-compliant special events providing for the implementation of administrative actions providing for codification providing for severability and providing an effective date has been a reading of ordinance 23-10 by title only on first reading Mr Mayor uh we workshopped this about two weeks ago this is the ordinance that was in part the product of some concerns raised by uh activist organizations and members of the community concerning special event permitting um and this is the ordinance done in collaboration with that organization uh to reach a a better product for the community and its code thank you Mr M let's go to the citizens for comments crickets all right citizen comments are now closed uh before we continue going to need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-10 would someone like to make a motion so moved motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Mr Roberts vice mayor Shirley you have the floor I think we Workshop this pretty well and um it's been an ongoing work and progress trying to fix an ordinance that was uh Loosely assembled years ago um Mr Moore did a great job pulling it together and working with the um Outside Agency that was that brought it to our attention and um I think it's something we should move on I agree um it was a great collaborative um I guess authoring of this ordinance um it was something we had to do uh otherwise it could very well be challenged and the last thing we want to do is wind up in court uh so uh because of this entire process we now have as Mr mois says a better product uh in our code of ordinances when dealing with events any other comments no all right Patty would you please call the rooll council member Banker yes I'm sorry yes thank you council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts yes vice mayor Shirley I mayor gallis I and so ordinance 23-10 first reading is approved unanimously all right now let's go to item number 15 which is consideration of ordinance 23-05 which will be the second and final reading Mr M you have a thank you Mr Mayor this is ordinance 23-05 and ordinance of the city council of the city of b beach amending chapter 18 section 18-5 of the city's code of ordinances entitled time for qualifying removing the time the specified qualifying period providing for the establishment of the qualifying period by resolution of the city council providing for the incorporation of recitals providing for separability and providing an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance 23-05 by title only Mr Mayor before we do to Citizen comments would you you um please give a summary as to why this uh this ordinance was created yes happily Mr Mayor so the um your code presently provides that the no person shall qualify as a candidate in any regular city election prior to 8 amm on the 88th day preceding the next regular election nor later than 12 noon on the 81st day um it's a very fixed set period it is inflexible um there's not really a lot of leeway to change that as it's written um and so the as if you apply that to the March 2024 election for example it would fall past the deadline that the city needs to notify the uh supervisor of elections of the ballot language and qualified candidates and it would also span the Christmas holiday such that uh and the weekend such that there would really be two or three business days during which somebody could qualify which would present challenges to candidates interested in the position and so um in order to rectify that what we've done is change that language to just say we'll do a resolution this is very common in other communities to set the qualifying period by resolution which you only do on one reading that resolution is in our materials tonight and and we'll be reading and addressing that in a moment um but that's why this uh was written um addressing your your election code thank you Mr let's go to the citizens for comments anyone like to comment on ordinance 23-05 all right citizen comments are now closed I'm going to need a motion to adopt ordinance 23-05 again this is the second and final reading

March 2024 election um at which point the seat will be up for regular election and we'll address that in the in the uh resolution as well that's next yes okay great all right well uh let's get to the first official order of business for Mr Chester uh this is uh item number 17 it's consideration of resolution 2023-2024 d10 a resolution of the city council of the city of B Beach Florida calling for a general election to be held on March 19th 20124 for the purpose of electing three city council members for a full term of office and a fourth seat for the remaining tenure of a recently vacated council member position to establish the qualifying date in process for person seeking elective office for the 2024 municipal election authorizing the city manager to enter into an agreement with the supervisor of elections establishing a pooling place for the March election authorizing penis County Supervisor of Elections to verify candidate petition cards and facilitate the election process and establishing an effective date this has been a reading of resolution 2023-2024 part is Administrative it is um to document for our purposes and with the supervisor of elections what we are calling for you have three seats whose regular cycle is scheduled to be on the March 2024 ballot um I don't think there's any real any real controversy or question there there was some discussion about what happens with members able seat and the language in your Charter as it reads contemplates that the person appointed by the council upon a vacancy Shall Serve until the next regular election our next regular election is scheduled to be held in March 2024 what will happen is that election for that seat will do nothing to change the cycle that that seat is on what it will do is whoever is elected in March 2024 to the seat vacated by members AEL will serve for the remainder of that term ordinarily I would tell you they will serve until March 2025 when they will serve until is in part a function of how all these Charter amendments function because if those terms are extended through November 2026 then that may change that calculus however they will serve for the remainder of the natural term of council memb Able's office upon the March election how are we going to do that was a question we had at the last work session and that's provided for in the resolution in section four Suba and subb and the way that it reads basically is the three assuming you get four people who run the three people um you know and as I and as I view this we may have to address this assuming you get five people to run the three people who get the most votes will get the regular seats the fourth person will get fourth place will get that shorter term and that's how that's designed to function um as I review the resolution um I'm realiz realizing that it doesn't address what would happen if in the event you don't have a full if only four people run how will that be decided um that could be construed as a tie that would be resolved by your um your Charter's language on you know drawing lots and straws and the like um and we may I may in speaking with the clerk and manager wish to do another resolution in November to clarify that um but assuming you have five people such that you're having an election um and and a contested election the top four vote Getters would fill those seats first place second place third place if you will would take the ordinary seats fourth place would fill council member Chester seat and for and council member Chester you are fully eligible provided you remaining a qualified elector of the city you are fully eligible to run again um in Earnest to run for the position in March thank you for uh for clearing that up for us let's go to the citizens for comment no all right citizen comments are now closed before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve resolution [Music] 2023-2024 second by Frank Banker Miss Naro you have the floor I think that this um resolution is very clear um section three where he talks about the three vacancies and then the other one gets the rest of Mr Z's term I think it's it's clear and it makes sense and and as I was talking about talking about it as an aside with city manager a moment ago um one of the suggestions we had he had was if we have four people qualify we can still just run the election just to see functionally who's getting that fourth seat that's one approach we could do um or to save on the election we would have to address how that would be resolved without the need for one um May a c that I didn't address that here um um in the in the various ordinances on elections that was an an oversight that we can still address um I would appreciate your insights on that if you would prefer that you run election if there are only four people um if of course if you have less than four people run then those two or three would get full terms but at at four do you want to run an election or would you have that rather resolved by Lots on who gets the Short Straw and there for the short term yeah I I would I would say that if we only had four candidates the first question would be to go to each candidate and see if anyone would consider doing the shortterm and then that would save that would save us from having to uh at least have that ballot language in uh but we have other ballot language anyway so I don't know what the if there' be any you're you're running an election regardless for sure have we always treated the replacement I don't I don't recall they always in the past and maybe it's just been handled wrong but when we had replace someone on Council they stayed on through that term through that person's term that may be the case candidly I didn't go through the entire history of it in part because all of that is fact intensive for example member Livingstone was appointed in June of last year it feels like she's just served a longer time than member Chester might get to but it's really just a function of when member gun seat is up in March um whether or not it was done in the past to me doesn't militate the doesn't command the result to me I looked to the plain language of your Charter um I reviewed that with your fellow CH with my fellow Charter officials candidly I reviewed it with my colleagues as well to say am I am I missing something here and the the unanimous uh consensus of reviewing the language of your Charter as it reads is that they are appointed and serve until the next regular election um and and nothing and the rest of the charter specifically dictates the cycles that seats are are up for election so that would run counter to other language and you have to read a document like that in harmony with all its terms so that's how I got to that result it may I can't tell you that it was never done the other way had I been your City Attorney at the time I don't think I would have interpreted it that way in the way that that I see this I I at first I didn't agree with you at all and then I realized that really we're not flipping the cycle what we're doing is if you have have a an elected official who resigns early in his term um you're not actually you're giving the council to speak on behalf of the citizens there's still a whole more greater than 50% of a term that uh we should take it to the citizens to allow to vote for but less than if it were less than half the term then I would then then then this is the case of like Mark Chester here I I don't know that it's really about how much is left in the term as much as it is are you having another election again on a regular cycle not a special election are you having another regular election if so the documents of your Charter and the spirit of the representative democracy that we have say well then let the voters weigh in you're having an election anyways you guys filled the seat as a stop Gap measure so that we could continue to do business with the full complement of seven members and avoid three three ties in and the like where we didn't need them um but now the voters are going to be weighing in on three other seats why not just have them Place everybody I think is really more the thrust of it it's not if he had been in his last year but we're having a regular election same result and that is what's happening members able seat would have been forgetting all the charter amendments would have been up in March 2025 that's one year left in the term on its ordinary cycle so it's not really about how much is left in the term as much as the seat was vacated before a next regular election had memb Z resigned in April 2025 whoever filled that seat whether it was member CH Mr I mean in April of 2024 that person would serve 11 months and they would never come up for election because there's no regular election between that and the end of the term so that's the only reason where time comes in if you're less than a year left because you don't have a regular election or if it's after the qualifying period then obviously they yes um that would be that would be another issue yeah so um if you can't qualify time so um that's that's why this is working this way um and um you know my my one request of you um as we look at this resolution would to be I'd appreciate consensus on how you want to handle if you have exactly four members qualify how would you like that handled that's um again my shortcoming in drafting this that it's not drafted but it's not in there but I would appreciate Council Insight on what you'd like to see in that instance I've heard member gtis mayor Gus's recommend that you see if we can't get somebody to volunteer for the shorter term but is that what is that the rle of the body or at least the consensus of the comments yes so I think it's clear that if we have five or more candidates for the March election then then we definitely will um have an election yes sir that's clear if we have four or less but we have four exactly even though it may cost not may it will cost money to have an election I guess my gut feel is it makes sense to go ahead and do that for the sole purpose of knowing what what are citizens how they voted so we was one two three and four and as you stated earlier whoever comes out to be fourth out of the four would take Mr zap seat right and understand you are having an election for the um based on at least at this point you have first reading I won't presume second reading passes but should it pass in the same manner then you will have issue elections on the ballot at the very least interesting any other comments no all right um I'm sorry mayor I don't mean to interrupt your presiding officer I'm looking for consensus Direction one of the challenges I had in drafting the charter amendments was I want a consensus Direction and I had one or two of you speak to it it'd be really helpful to get the views of those members you have not spoken you'd like this this answer now it would be most helpful yes I would we can do that um okay well let's just uh let's start with Mark Chester well I will tell you this there's a big difference between serving a year and a half as opposed to five months yes sir and I'm not sure I agree with you on the filling we've had this happen before in our country where we had to they appointed somebody president after they resigned and they didn't have a an earlier election they filled out the term so yes and I would say those were Bound by different documents yeah no I I so I'm just I you might have had more people participate in this if it wasn't for only five months as opposed to fill the entire term that's my two sents I hear that um understanding that we're here now um if four people qualify how would you like that resolved in terms of would you would you prefer that we resolve that internally meaning draw Lots or straws or something to see whose four place or do you think in the instance where there are four qualified candidates that that that should be submitted to the elector I I always like for the the people to be able to vote on things I I'm also in favor of saving money and not wasting money whenever that's possible so okay putting a lot of pressure on somebody who just got up here left or right would you like on this yeah you know as far saving money by not have if we only have four people qualified we're going to have to have the election anyway because of the um amendments to the Charter so the um you know having another question on there is not going to be that significant having the council member election on there so is that uh you would prefer the vote in that instance pardon so is that you saying you in an instance where four people qualify you think a vote would be more appropriate have election thank you put them on the Belt I would say yes put them on the ballot but it still shakes out to how do we determine who gets what seat right whoever gets the least out of those four whoever gets the lowest number gets the oneyear term or the what would ordinarily be the one-year term the shortest term we don't have any other option right I mean you have to put them on the ballot what what else are you g to do the other option is to treat it as a four-way tie and in your code a tie is resolved as evidence here by drawing Lots or something else so if you treat it as a you can treat it as a tie or you can submit it to the voters if you treat it as a tie we would draw Lots or straws or something and that's assuming we don't end up reducing the council that vote passes in March 2 to reduce the Council to five then then you're going to have that doesn't that doesn't impact this cycle though okay it'll be so that vote was it's not retro I mean it doesn't happen at the same vote no the the cycle down to five happens at the conclusion of um that seats term that fourth seats term so they would serve that remaining period and then at the end of that there's there's two less Council positions yeah got it okay yes for M bank I think the charter is pretty clear on how to do this I want to stick with it treated as a tie and then yeah understood Miss Livingstone um I think council member NATO um summarized it pretty well and I'm in agreement with having an election it makes sense Mr Roberts so one scenario that we didn't really talk about yet so let's say for example we have four spots and we only have three people people that actually register um so then all three of them what do we what do we I'm just curious the vacancy thereafter we would appoint a vacancy okay got it got it got it got it yeah so I'm in favor of um of the votes uh people people will be voting on the charter items anyway so that makes sense to me um I'm still I'm in the mindset that if we have four candidates um that anyone who is interested in a short term sort is a trial size they should be given that opportunity and then the other three would do a full term and then you don't even have to have the names on the ballot it would cure itself understood I think I have my consensus Direction um I will of course look at this particular aspect of this remember Banker your point on the charter is well taken it could be treated as a tie um much as you would you know you would treat it as um they have all voted for themselves and it's a four-way tie that would be the result absence some direction if for some reason um in reviewing that my analysis changes because this was an on thefly issue I spotted I will let you know okay we still need to vote on the resolution there all right all right so we are voting on resolution 20 23-10 as written yes as written and you already have your Motion in your second py would you please call the role council member Banker yes I'm sorry yes thank you council member Chester yes council member Livingstone yes council member Noto yes council member Roberts I vice mayor Shirley I mayor gotus hi so uh resolution 20 23-10 passage unanimously and um we'll move forward with that as written all right we are on to item number 19 unfinished business do we have any unfinished bus business we would like to discuss 18 we got 18 city manager I lost the page hand second you go thank you okay that's funny authorize the city manager to Grant easements to Duke Energy Florida LLC um before we go to the council for comments and uh and a vote on this would the citizens like to speak no citizen comments citizen comments are closed all right uh this is placed on the agenda by uh city manager reer you have the floor thank you mayor so this is a item we discussed in the last work session this is a an easement at Crossman Park that Duke is requesting to place switch gear uh equipments uh that have to um do with the undergrounding of the Gulf Boulevard on the Eastern side um like I mentioned before the uh the idea when designing this project was to try to keep all the equipment as much as possible off private property um in some instances um it was unavoidable and uh residents have cooperated and given easements to Duke Energy to make this project go um this is an opportunity uh where the switch gear can be placed on the public land of Crossman Park and um this uh it's a city's decision to allow that easement um for the purpose of of the undergrounding project I've included the uh easement itself the uh the map of uh where the two switch gear will be placed in Cross Park which is going to be the Northwest uh part of the parcel and um also they gave us a sort of a rendering of what what the equipment would look like in the Park thank Mr reefer before we move forward on this I'm going to need a motion uh to authorize a city manager to Grant easement to Duke Energy Florida LLC do I have a motion motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley Mr Banker do you have the floor those two boxes junction boxes to the left um are they going to be removed no those that's communic all communication both of them uh the one looks like it is power the little one should be communication the little one's and then the inground box is communication as well in front of it um let me get clarification on the little small electrical box okay that's all any other U I have a question um it looks like the house on the corner on the opposite corner has a box or something going in there I'm going to assume the easements already been granted but I realized today they're digging Footers for a wall there is that has that been taken into consideration yes that that wall has been taken in consideration the entire project um it was actually as you know that it was trenched and left for quite some time it's because it's a unique piece of property where um our usual rules in our ordinances for walls don't apply because it's completely the Cy's right away with um with their line of sight for their intersection so they did get involved after we approved it per our uh code um and then they had the they've actually had to back the wall off of the property line closer to the to the house itself and reduce the height of the wall because of the intersection but Duke's been part of this process the putters are huge I mean you know as they should be for a block wall and uh I just noticed that been digging them this morning so yeah yeah no they're fully aware okay I I was shocked that a single person was out there digging that trench I hand female really it was a female wow okay any other questions or comments on this topic no all right all in favor I any opposed all right you are authorized thank you may okay now let's move to item 19 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business no all right I think everyone's probably getting ready to go May um I know I didn't get this in on city manager report I just want to mention that uh officer Kapa did point out that the sergeant was called into an emergency that was supposed to be here to do the report so it was actually a situation where a lot of officers were needed good I mean not good but you know what I'm saying at least we have an excuse all right uh well in that case let's just move on to item 20 Council comments you know what I Mark I'm gonna skip you this time I'll come back to you next to last right all right so up next is council member Roberts thank you
