    "transcript": "so i'm calling to order the monday july 19th uh this is the special city council meeting in the city of belarus beach please rise to the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice [Music] council member robert locky here council member fred banker here council member glenn gunn here council member leslie ontario councilmember rita spoke here vice mayor dave gaddis mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves here and one is consideration of setting the tentative military for fy 2021 through 2022 no other information first motion movement um about the proposed um state of attendance military and i totally agree with him that setting it at 2.0394 mills is for a major number this is we can always come back we can't go higher so i think this is a a wise move to do at this point uh this is part of the requirement of the tax season that we have to turn in the attentive military it's as high as we can go uh wherever we sit with the tentative uh of course you could send it much higher if you look on the second page you can set it to 2.3793 or 2.6172 but i'm not requesting that what i'm requesting is to maintain the millage as it is right now there will be two other votes uh september eighth at six o'clock and the final public hearing will be september these the tentative village raid the estimate is 2.0394 and we estimated a 96 collection rate uh which would bring in 1 million 250 100 but at this point this is 10 so i'm going to make that perfectly clear so i'm asking for the concept to give me approval to submit this to the property this is an upper limit we can't go above it in the future we can go down so this is not an endorsement in any way shape or form that this should be our final military it's really just setting a cap on ourselves that we're not gonna go above and you've given us four different scenarios over here um no citizen comments back to council leslie you have the last word are you proposed the we don't have a rate proposed here so we i i think maybe the best way to do it is just to pull each person and ask what rate they want i think i know how this is going to probably wind up so military okay so then we're gonna have an amended motion a right yes could you repeat the rating okay so right now there's a there's a motion just to amend just to amend the rate so that we can vote on the rate so you're not both another rate this is just can we book on a rate and that's going to be 2.0394 leslie made that motion at the second hit okay i think she already made the motion i thought that was my original function now the original motion was consideration of setting the tentative millage rate for fy 2122. there's no rate specified so now we're specifying the rate i thought she said i said i thought i said we can't go off the agenda the agenda says consideration of setting the rate you get four options next time we want to put in 2.0394 if that's what you want then we can vote on that or shoot it down so now she's making the motion to amend don't worry it's going to pass the 2.394 so basically no counsel no other comments back to counsel no other council comments the motion right now is simply to amend the question to make the rate 2.0394 mills that's correct leslie that's what you want yes don't shake your head it's not what you want i wouldn't do it okay yes okay good so patty if you would call the role this is just to amend this is not an affirmation of the rate it's just to amend the question that we're going to vote on next council member swope yes council member notaro yes council member gunn council member banker yes councilmember aki um vice mayor gaddis all right mayor manza all right so seven to zero the question is amended and never call this question this is consideration of setting the tentative military for 2021 fy 2021 through 20. sorry that long take that back start all over again consideration of setting up military for fy 2021 through 2022 at 2.0394 bills madam clerk council member slope councilmember doterra aye councilmember gunn aye council member banker yes council member authy aye vice mayor davis all right mayor mentioned all right seven to zero attendant military is 2.0394 thank you mayor very welcome next authorize the city manager to execute a purchase order to transfer design services from okay yeah frank's still with us yes okay i'll just re-read it author i see maybe we should make a motion to get working audio video equipment i turned it off thank you authorize city manager to execute a purchase order to transfer design services from engineering sciences group to dual associates the explanation is transfer of agreement with esg inc to dual associates due to unforeseen circumstances for completion of the 12th and 13th street stormwater quarter project in the amount of 32 thousand dollars first of all entertain a motion second second and gather free yes as i stated that previously that the engineer that we originally has a personal situation and is not able to complete the task currently and we need to move this project forward i reckon i went to one of our in firms under contract and they gave me a price of 32 000 to take over this so i'm asking for authorization to transfer the po we'll cancel the pog p-o-t-e-s-g uh and just so you're aware i have been in contact with the engineer's wife and tell her we were planning to do this because the council approved [Music] have they provided us something in writing saying that they will be breaching this contract they're not going to be able to complete it due to these circumstances uh unfortunately not getting into the details the engineer is not available to do that does the engineer have a standby engineer who gambles business no that was my concern because this is an anticipatory breach of the contract and i mean i totally agree with going out and getting this with somebody else you have to do that but before you do that um we need to make sure that we're legally covered because right now and i'm not your city attorney fred riley should be talking to you on this one but um i think what you're going to need something from them saying they can't do it other than a telephone call from his wife that's my opinion i think fred should get the last word on this one um to make sure that we're leaving because when you let this other contract out i mean i don't know this situation i don't know where the engineer is i don't know if you know i'm not even going to speculate what's that wrong but he comes back and he goes we'll let my contract go you know so i understand when this stuff happens i guess going forward if you approve that this with the caveat that i talked to fred about it and see if i can get something it's it's not going to come from the engineer i can tell you that but i don't want to discuss this situation it's not you need authorization tonight again this week until august 2nd uh i would like authorization tonight to go forward subject to mike fred's approval somebody want to amend this uh so i would like to amend this so that we can uh provide a transfer agreement with the stipulation from the city attorney that he's got we have the city attorneys approved and forward on this and the city attorney's approval can go ahead and execute the change over the purchase i might just add with regard to the old contract for exiting the contract well it's a purchase order it's going to give you that purchase order it's a purchase orders of contract it's still a contract yeah yeah that's that's a okay okay we have a second second by robin hockey any discussion on that after you uh citizens back to you glenn we're going to vote on that amendment right now so this will amend glencum if i say this incorrect in any way shape or form um we're going to mention i'm getting better um authors actually if you get the city managed execute purchase sort of transfer design services from engineering services group to dual associates we're going to add to that with the city attorney's approval with regard to exiting the old purchase order slash contract okay okay so we're not giving the whole authorization this is just to amend that question then i'll call it again um i think we can do this one as a voice oh right it's not resolution or an ordinance okay so all in favor of just the amendment i i want to vote seven to zero on the amendment now i'll read it and we'll quote the question um there's no other comments right from citizens or council okay authorization of the city for the city manager to execute a purchase order to transfer design services from engineering sciences group inc to dual associates um and the immediate piece of this is to add the provision that the city attorney is to approve the uh the transfer out of the old contract or purchase order uh to dissatisfaction that will that will be the go ahead for you that's a conditioned precedent before you could operate okay uh lynn all right and uh uh yes vote we'll get this moving along uh i'll do a voice vote on this all in favor aye aye anyone opposed i got seven to zero so then as amended please go forward if there's a problem i mean i could call a special counsel meeting if you can't wait till the next meeting in august if you don't get that answer i'm sure fred could come up with a solution for you pretty easily all right there's nothing else on the agenda the next item is a german on uh let's see a motion second all in favor"
