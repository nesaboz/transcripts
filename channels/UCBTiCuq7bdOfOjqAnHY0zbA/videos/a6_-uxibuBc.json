    "transcript": "good evening everyone it's now 6 12. thank you for bearing with us for the technical difficulties um it is our monday october 5th regular city council meeting we're now called to order everyone please rise if you can and join me in the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all madam clerk would you please call the role councilmember robin aki here council member mark beam here council member dave gattis council member jody shirley here councilmember rita swope here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor joseph manzo city manager lynn reeves here and city attorney fred riley here okay thank you so um this is a zoom meeting obviously and i can see everyone except for rita swope so if reader wishes to speak please get my attention by saying mayor and um you will be recognized i cannot see you raise your hand everyone else is able to be seen so the first item on the uh agenda tonight we have a long agenda folks we have 30 items last time we did this we were here to one in the morning so i'm hoping for the best but um will somebody like to make a motion to approve the agenda don't move mark b makes the motion do we have a second second that's jody shirley yes yes okay uh discussion counsel glenn gunn uh regarding the consent agenda i'd like to pull number six and move it to the irregular agenda okay so we have a proposal for pulling item six glenn i'm going to come back and look for the second on that but i want to say something about the consent agenda also because um although i can't make a motion i'm going to ask that your emotion maybe eclipse the entire consent agenda um i look at this consent agenda and i see 12 items on it which actually is greater than what we have on our regular agenda um and fred i'm coming to you with these with a question very shortly okay um the consent agenda normally is a is routine items in nature they're supposed to be non-controversial they're supposed to not deviate from past or direction or policy and they usually don't require board comment um we usually vote on them as a group without any comment um i have in the past said many times that i don't believe that um minutes should be in here there's definitely there should always be discussion on minutes i serve on three boards they're never a consent agenda item but more disturbing than the minutes which i do think have to be removed and i agree with glenn gunn on that there are several things on here where we're actually suspending bid requirements and there's several actually there's other items that i'm not even sure what they are there's stuff about purchasing an atv or an rtv accepting curb replacement contracts i think all of this stuff not only needs comment by the council but it also and fred this is your question it's coming um i believe it requires that we open this question these questions and uh ability to comment to the citizens um with the open public meeting law i i look at this consent agenda i think there's too much in here that we're just trying to push through um normally consent agenda is like gay it's somebody's 100th birthday and we're wishing them well or it's national cancer month or something like that this is there's controversial items in here and there's discussion items in here so um my point would be to move everything out of the consent agenda but i'm going to ask you now fred is this consent agenda the way it's written now unamended acceptable and in compliance with the state law regarding the open public meetings law i think as a kid certainly is acceptable um now and you want to remove things from the consent agenda fred you faded out for me in the middle of that i don't know if that anybody else yeah and jody's nodding her head so would you say to say wait let me say what you said please i'll say it again say it a little bit louder is that everybody hear that yes okay the the fact that there's a whole bunch of different items in the consent agenda i don't see that as a problem because the citizens have the opportunity if you do not modify the consent agenda to comment on any given item so i think you're covered there if you want to remove items from the consent agenda and discuss them individually you're you're certainly able to do that oh my god i might just throw in that for the up for for uh expediency purposes i mean we went to the consent agenda to keep things moving quickly the backup items are in the package for people's review and perhaps the best way to deal with this is to manage them by exception if any council member has a question or a concern it's easy enough to pull it from the consensus and if if there's no concerns or questions just leave it in there and prove it i rather than go through every item you know agenda line item by line item put it in there if anybody has a question or concern manage it by exception and ask that it'd be removed like i just did to move it to your regular agenda okay so why don't i do this why don't we just uh go one by one through council if anybody wants to have items removed and then we'll put one global motion together if that makes sense glenn's nodding yes so i think that's it so glenn you spoke first you wanted item six removed right that's correct okay anyone else i just have a question on thirteen and let's see here 13 and 15. we have 6 13 15 anyone else i'm going to ask for item 10 and item 14. so we have items right now we have 6 13 14 15 and 10. does anyone else have anything they wish to have removed from the consent agenda would someone please give me a motion for everything if possible mayor just i'll i'll give the motion to move whatever we talked about i don't remember the numbers off 10 13 and 15. all right move them to the regular agenda for discussion we have second second shirley seconds any discussion citizen discussion back to council the motion is to move items 6 10 13 14 and 15 to the regular agenda madam clerk please call council member aki hi councilmember bean hi councilmember gaddis he's uh he's muted i think councilmember shirley hi councilmember swope hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so items 6 10 13 14 and 15 are going to be moved to the regular agenda give me one second so i could make that mark on my on my chart here now the remaining items uh and well actually to um approve the overall agenda as amended um we have it do we have a motion to swap is my promotion second second dave gaddis any discussion citizens back to council matt clerk you want the roll call again yes please this is to approve the agenda as amended council member aki aye councilmember bean hi councilmember gattis council member shirley hi councilmember swoe hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo hi so the motion pass is seven to zero the agenda is approved we now move to item two on the agenda which are the citizens comments um i am going to uh briefly speak on this um after the last meeting um i know that we're not in our regular council session where the code of conduct is visible at display but there were some issues last time and particularly there were the issues of individuals not addressing council as a whole that was one of the problems and certainly bringing personalities and direct personal attacks in on that you can't do it okay it's that simple we have 15 rules here i'm not i was i was going to read a lot of them tonight and i said no you know we got too big of an agenda here but um suffice it to say if you're attacking anyone on this council you're not doing the right thing okay if you do that you're going to hear a point of order and when that happens then please stop speaking allow us at the council level and with the city attorney to sort this out we'll let you know if you're going to be able to continue i'll stress item 15. all members of the public are to conduct themselves with decorum and of course that goes for us too on the council we're not asking you to follow any rules that we don't so with that said i'm going to open this up to the floor um and please be mindful last time there were a lot of warnings given i'm not doing it tonight yes glenn gunn well i don't think any warnings were given by you during the last citizen comments because i provided over that portion of the agenda with respect to that i think i probably uh ruled hastily on some of those uh those calls regarding a point of order uh i've gone back since then and like you probably read through all those codes of conduct as well as reviewed the charter and how it addresses these sorts of things and i i've walked away with a couple of opinions here first of all is uh i find uh some irony in the fact that we stress first amendment rights in this this body and yet we are very quick to not hear what our citizens and residents have to say and i think it's a fine line between uh interpreting statements of fact versus subjective opinions regarding personal attacks i respect the fact that citizens should address the council as a body and not address individuals i agree that there should not be questions about personal motors etc etc but it is uh an irony that uh we make some very quick calls uh to silence our citizens without hearing exactly what they have to say i think some things that need to be taken into account are the uh what it means to be an elected official and you have to have some thick skin with regards to feedback from our citizens and our residents and you have to kind of factor that in so uh what i would suggest is that we tread extremely lightly on making calls regarding uh points of order with respect to personal attacks i think we need to hear what our citizens have to say and if they are stating their opinions within the confined and the construct of our code of conduct addressing the body not questioning personal motors etc then i think we should air on the side of first amendment rights and uh that and i think that's probably enough said there uh there is also going to be some conflict obviously if there are some questions about personal attacks that are suggestive of the presiding officer and yet he is going to rule on a point of order so i think these are some things that we need to consider uh the elephant in the room and uh but maybe we need to have a short discussion on that and see if i'm misstating something or if i my logic training is going right here that's all i have to say well i listened to you respectfully mr gunn and or vice mayor gunn and you did preside over the last meeting and made the calls i don't agree with just about every call you made but that's beside the point they were made it's over with it's like a baseball game you don't go back and replay it um if there's one rule in robert's rules of order which is required by our charter to be followed it is you are to show respect to the individuals up here and where to show respect to each other and we're just without respect to people in the audience there is nothing that conflicts me out and for anyone who's coming here to make personal attacks you're in the wrong room i will call it every time how dare people get first amendment lectures when these people are implicated in a first amendment lawsuit unbelievable i'm gonna move on to citizen comments at this point okay if you hear point of order please stop okay um we will discuss this if necessary up here i have the ability to turn to the city attorney and if it gets to be too much we will call a break which is the procedure that we have uh informally worked out and then we will discuss it the city manager the city attorney and myself we'll come back and we'll discuss whether the person will be proceeding or not proceeding if you come here to discuss personal lawsuits i will remind you of item number um let's see hang on give me one second number 11 you can speak about any manner on the city's business or any matter over which the city council has control city council does not control us as individuals nor do they control our personal lives we don't talk about people's businesses and their pursuits their individual pursuits i'm not going to entertain it i can't speak about it and no one else will speak about it either okay and that was all a point order i don't think anyone here needs a lecture i i think it's you've made your point and i would like to proceed forward with this meeting that's wonderful dave but you're not the mayor i have the floor you did not call a point of order of any validity so it's not well-founded and don't interrupt please you're not permitted to interrupt because you're tired of what the person is saying now i'm going to move to citizen comments i've given the comments and the rules if i have to i'll read the ordinance i have them in front of me mr riley be prepared to uh to help me with decisions on here madame clerk are there any is there anyone who wishes to be heard mayor i don't have the screen i'm on uh i can't say it i don't i can't see if um uh if uh individuals wish to be heard i i don't see that i can only see our council there's a hand raised but i i click there is she ready i see a hand raised actually i do see a hand raise is um is her microphone on let's not let me i don't hear her i i see her but i don't have any control i'd like to make a suggestion uh i i know that um liam you are showing as a host but also uh patty is even though she can not speak she should still be able to control the meeting um even though she's listening on the speakerphone she should still have all of the same controls me go over there real quick the star i don't know when zuma is baby star six asked if she hears you okay look it says i'm still connecting okay um let's i don't want to click anything cut the media off but it says i'm still connecting so i'm not connected right but look down here do you want me to try this no that's not working either okay no no no no no what talking here yeah i know but i'm trying to see i think jane can if she can you hear me tell her just uh what is it star three oh i don't know jane can you unmute wait wait wait hold on she can only unmute whenever you turn you mute yourself dave because you're also a guest when i uh but see what it's showing me is that i'm still connecting it's just spinning it's not showing that i'm connected we're not there you're here now forget that who are you talking to you you're here so what does she have to do dave does she have to mute herself on this phone yes she needs to mute herself and then she can authorize jane lochner to speak you can only do one person at a time so lynn if you go back to your desk you can mute patty and then unmute jane okay thank you dave okay let's go here it's not let me do anything dave lynn i'm gonna try to mute my phone myself okay so i'm doing that right now now try try jane no it's not letting me do anything all right i have a really stupid question but dave can you log in as a host and take control of the meeting so we can get this meeting done you're muted lynn are you able to promote me to host i'm i'm i am just a panelist i'm not a host to myself okay let's try this patty's the host okay try let's try this no i don't believe it's a problem with patty or her computer i see it's she's trying to connect to audio and it's something's just not right did you hear that patty analyst if you do this make host looks like you can make yourself a host me let's see if i can make dave the host participants play participants click panelists tab hover over the name of the you want to make the host okay and then click on make host try it with you click on participants click the panelist tab participants panelist hover over your name click on more rename now and there's no make host click the panelist tab i'm on the panel when you hover it should say more it says rename while patty tries to re reconnect let's i think we can just go forward with the meeting and we'll have to have citizens comments after at some point i would recommend that patty completely disconnect reboot her computer and start over okay okay so want me to do you want me to continue uh and we will come back to citizen comments i think that's probably well even if you do that you're going to need to have uh the opportunity for citizens to comment on each measure you you're going to focus so well we have we have the presentation of the pinellas sheriff's next and we have a presentation of whit blanton next so um maybe we can go to the presentations can i interrupt one second councilmember do you see that i'm

technology works isn't it great i've had the same struggles in the hover all this time thank you thank you for bearing with us just give us for your the record your name and address and then please proceed yet is anyone timing this mr reeves i will okay you have three minutes miss lochner jane lafner 3320 hibiscus drive west on 9th september 2020 i made citizens comments that due to the technical glitch we're not capturing the recording in the meeting those comments and additional comments i will present tonight are statements of fact are not attacks or questioning motives however these facts have placed us in an untenable position i implore the council to consider these facts first regarding my comments from 9 september those comments stay there for florida statute 112.312 subparagraph 21 miss jun van scoyak is a relative mr joseph manzo per the statute of relative also includes any other natural person having the same legal residence as a public officer employee unless otherwise specified in this part part meeting part three code of ethics for public officers employees of florida statute section 112. mr manzo is correct in stating that this florida statute has two definitions of relative as per discussions with city attorneys documented the same council meeting minutes of 1 june 2020. she does not fit the definition of relative so i do not have to recuse myself and i'm not going to to be clear the definition relative under florida statute section 112.3143 subparagraph charlie does not include the phrase some legal res same legal residence the public officer but it only applies to voting conflicts not the rest of the florida statute one one two part three second florida statute section 112.311 so paragraph one states it is essential the proper conduct and operation of government the public officials be independent and impartial in that public office not be used for private gain other than remuneration by provided by law that public interest therefore requires the law of protect against any conflict of interest and established standards for the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations where conflicts may exist furthermore paragraph five the same statute states it is hereby declared to be the policy of state of no office or employee of a state agency or county city or other political subdivision of the state and no matter that a slavery legislative employee shall have any interest financial or otherwise direct or indirect engage in a business transaction or professional activity or incurring obligation of nature which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his or her duties in the public interest and stay in my first point a substantial conflict of interest has existed ever since miss van scoyock became the parks and rec chairman while her removal by the council has resolved this conflict of interest the tension it has caused the last 18 months has been detrimental to the council in this city third are public offices of public trust public officers are agents of the people and hold resistance for the benefit of the public you're three minutes okay thank you miss lochner mr riley please unmute yourself yes i'm calling upon you now and i have the right to do this to explain uh what it means when there is a voting conflict of interest or any other conflict of interest ms lochner and i'll i'll complete what she had said last time called upon my resignation failed to call upon the resignation of the four individuals that are implicated in the lawsuit jody shirley rita spoke dave gaddis and glenn gunn so does this require all the council five people to resign or does this simply mean as i know what the answer is that you need if something comes up before the council to possibly recuse yourself from voting on that mr riley well first i'm going to say the there's the a rule and i'll cite it if you'd like that the city council cannot discuss discuss prospective or pending litigation so nothing i i am going to say is related to perspective of pending litigation the general scheme in florida and scheme does not have a bad connotation is that a conflict of interest is declared when there's going to be a vote on a certain measure so until the point comes when there's a vote there's typically not an analysis of whether there's a conflict of interest or not so i uh followed what miss lochner said it you know from memory a lot of the things she cited sound very familiar to me i assume she is citing things in an accurate way she said she was so i i will take her at her word but at this point uh with respect to a conflict of interest there's not a matter that the city council is voting on so i don't see any basis for a city council person at this point in time to be addressing conflict of interest about any particular measure okay thank you very much and and we're not going to get into any particulars um but for the record no lawsuit has even been filed in this matter as this correction be discussing anything with respect okay well that's public record anyway but you shouldn't be discussing it because that's what your rule says okay glenn gund and jody shirley glenn's muted find your muted plan is muted blend you gotta unmute yourself still made it there how's that okay i'm sorry for that my question is that's the second time i've heard my name mentioned with respect to regards to a lawsuit and yet i have no knowledge of seeing my name involved in a lawsuit so i would like to know where that's coming from i've seen some some notices right well again you know what i'm going to rule this out of order we're talking about the lawsuit so let's stop it okay the point has been made at this point the answer to the question from his locker i think has been answered um and if it hasn't that's as far as we're going to go with it tonight so michelle did you have anything i would like to say something i my understanding is that well first i find it interesting we can speak about the lawsuit if mr manzo wants to speak about it but no one else can um the our agreement is we don't respond to citizens comments we let them say what they're going to say and we move on to the next sentence they comment so i hope this isn't setting a standard for this meeting no it's actually not we're allowed i'm allowed to refer something to the appropriate individual and i referred this to mr riley so we're not responding to ms lochner no there's no more discussion with her her time is completed and we're moving on to the next person if there is a next person so i would help me continue the process absolutely mr raves is there anyone else who wishes to be heard i i see no one even though i'm not mr reeves okay oh i'm sorry dave you're the you're now the host okay so dave gaddis is there oh there is there is i have mike zabel okay mr zable all right let's see mr zabo you'll need to unmute okay yeah mike's able here hey what uh 3320 uh hibiscus drive west uh briefly i was nominated uh one of the three people to serve on an additional committee here but you know frankly uh been around the block war hero iraq all that other crap but uh i i can't in good faith serve a council like this uh you know spend my time my energy my vast experience and believe me it's fast you know you guys want to you know put resumes against me good luck you know you just can't match up uh but you know frankly mayor i just can't work for you so please put my uh name from the process thank you it is removed thank you anyone else do you see anyone else i see no other hands uh no okay then i'm gonna close citizen comments and we move to the presentation we have sergeant roy swike from the pinellas county sheriff's office sergeant evening mayor thank you the statistics for the month of august obviously the statistics for september are not pulled in time for the geocoding and everything so i have the statistics for the month of august the ucr part 1 crimes for the month there was an aggravated assault and a burglary in the aggravated assault it was domestic related and an arrest was made in that and the burglary at this time there's no known suspect and if there was entry into a rental condominium in the northern part of the city and there's no known suspect so that as of right now that one's been made inactive for the month of august there were a total of nine arrests and of course i mentioned the aggravated assault in that and the others were for traffic misdemeanors warrants and other misdemeanor crimes and they're nothing really of note there were a total of 980 events in the city of bel air beach and those are anywhere from house checks which dominated the total activity directed patrols all the way down to noise ordinance violations and then for crashes in the city there were total three crashes and then 171 warnings and citations issued in the city which goes to show that obviously the deputies are out there conducting the traffic enforcement that's been requested over the months since i've been supervising this squad that is all i have if there's any questions i don't have a question but i have a few comments this is councilmember swope i just want to say that you guys do an impressive job and i was very very impressed with the blue thunder coming here back in the blue on behalf of the purcells which are residents of bellar beach so i was there and attended that it was absolutely amazing so i just want to let you know that the blue thunder when they came through supported you and represented the blue very well thank you thank you ma'am sorry just mark beam i'd like to thank you guys for doing the undercover car checks the last few days i've seen you out there appreciate you doing that i hope that i saw some of the reports at the end of our packet and i saw a few cars there at 65 miles an hour i don't know if that's true or not but uh it's amazing that there were a few out there at that but i'm glad to see the cars out there thank you very much mr bm i'll pass that along typically the day shift that goes out there and does that my deputy that works on my shift he will go out there periodically and spot check certain areas but i will pass that along to the day shift sergeant thank you mayor you're muted sergeant i want to thank you for the work you've been doing you and all the deputies and uh the undercover i will let you know i knew it was working when i got a complaint from a resident wrote me a letter um complaining about the undercover investigation and i'm not going to read the letter into the record but i just wanted to paraphrase what the person was was complaining about and i want our council to hear this and see if they wish to take any action upon it um so the individual was complaining that they saw a man in a cap i'm not going to even give the color of the cap on the bridge and they uh they sped up coming down the bridge and they were met by one of your finest at the uh at the bottom of the bridge and they were clocked in at 50 miles an hour coming off the bridge on our side um and he the individual was complaining to me that this was a um what did they call it a speed trap and a quick way to make money and stuff like that so i just wanted to um bring this up to my council's attention and let you know that's what i heard i haven't answered the individual back um we have been asking for this type of enforcement for a year now and um you got them and that sounds like you got even bigger than 50 you got 65s and that's that's unbelievable in a city like us so um i think it's really good and i would like to speak with this council at a work session about continuing this uh this this work i think it worked real well for us in terms of having the undercover officers great job thank you mayor i'll pass it along to the day shift as well anyone else you're dave gattis and you're muted now dave you're unmuted he's muted i uh uh would just like to thank the entire department for really stepping up uh your game and uh and showing uh this city uh what what you're capable of and also showing uh visitors and a nearby residents that uh bel air beach is not the place to uh to be flying up and down the roads and uh definitely i think that you've made a serious difference um i'm very happy and proud that you guys are looking out for us and i really uh hope that you're able to keep up the good work we will certainly do our best anyone else on council dave uh is there anyone in the audience any citizens that would like to have any ques any questions uh checking right now uh yes i have a hand raised uh jeff okay if jeff is unmuted he can speak i think he's muted i think it looks like you're gonna have

get it in our next meeting okay read the slope um yes first off i'd like to echo debbie uh keith's comments about the purcells we should look at something to um you know honor them and acknowledge them for weld for everything they do and also mayor would you mind going ahead and send in the entire council i would like to see that letter a copy of that letter so we can put it into public record yeah absolutely absolutely i think that came to me actually via um via the city hall but if they don't have a copy i'll send them a copy back of what they already sent me do you have that patience yeah we do they gave it to me yeah so you could just just ask for it from city hall anyone else okay then that concludes it thank you uh thank you sergeant appreciate it um we now have a guest speaker

i try to meet with all the local governments in pinellas county and i appreciate a little bit of your time today first you know our job at ford pinellas is to bring state and federal funds to our local government partners and mayor i know i've met with you on the traffic issue and i want to applaud your commitment to traffic safety to address the speeding issues that you're observing in your community we have three main mechanisms for bringing transportation dollars through our programs to our individual communities we have a multimodal transportation improvement program a transportation alternatives program and a complete streets program these are apart from our safety initiatives and our work with the florida department of transportation and pinellas county just on their own capital improvement programs what we are working on in pinellas county is a balanced transportation solution which focuses on reducing traffic congestion making our roads safer for everyone in enhancing transit services that's sort of the weak leg of our three-legged stool when it comes to our transportation network the first thing i want to talk about is our multi-modal projects priority list ford pinellas as the mpo for pinellas county the metropolitan planning organization we provide a list of projects for the department of transportation at the state level to choose in developing their five-year work program so they take their direction from us in putting a work program together unless we're talking about the interstate system when we have our call for projects which is open now the minimum project cost is 350 000 there is no maximum we have a maximum of three applications per entity and all transportation modes are considered and we evaluate those projects against our long-range plan goals called advantage pinellas this is the first time that we have had a call for transportation projects for local governments the projects are due on this list in december and we look at these different criteria from safety to mobility to economic growth equity environment and resilience and all that the second major program that we have open is transportation alternatives these are smaller projects this is a pedestrian crossing at west bay drive not far from you where we focus on pedestrian and bicycle projects this is a federally funded program and the money can only be spent on pedestrian and bicycle projects there are some prerequisites that there be a local commitment to the project that can be a letter and there needs to be no right of way acquired with these funds we also require that the local government be able to be what's called part of the local agency program they need to be certified in that program but for smaller communities like bel air beach typically the county acts as a surrogate and works with you on those kinds of projects to get them done finally our third major program is complete streets and what we have done with complete streets over the last four years is have a call for projects for different types of projects that make streets safer for all users whether you're on foot a bicyclist or driving a car and we had a lot of success over the since 2016 when this program started the funds are divided into two categories construction projects where we award up to a million dollars to help construct a project and concept planning where we award up to a hundred thousand dollars for projects to vet them with the public to find their characteristics and uh and the concept and then that usually is the basis for awarding the construction applications and we apply these on state roads and non-state roads next i want to talk a little bit about our legislative priorities for the coming year we have formed a legislative committee they will be meeting in october for the first time this year well for the first time since we took a break over the summer last year we adopted a number of policy positions you can see on the on the page here and i'll cover these briefly first supporting urban agriculture in a lot of our communities we have what are called food deserts where there's no available access to fresh foods and so in those communities we've worked with the legislature to free up some of the right to farm legislation that prohibits some of these areas to provide food produce for sale next is protecting trust funds we have two main issues one is the transportation trust fund and the other is the housing trust fund the affordable housing trust fund the legislature routinely raids those funds for the general revenue fund and that depletes those funds for necessary dollars in those programs so we've asked the legislature to protect those funds and thankfully this past legislative session they did that for the first time in probably a dozen years the next one is support flexible and sustained transportation funding pinellas county is um in an adverse situation compared to a lot of other counties because of our developed nature a lot of the funds for transportation that we can work with are limited to projects that can only expand highway capacity and we don't have that many projects that will add lanes to a road we can do some turn lanes here and there but in general we found that we had almost 400 million dollars in transportation revenues projected through the year 2045 that we would not have projects for so we've asked the legislature and we'll continue to ask to free up some flexibility so these funds can be used in pinellas county on projects that still have value that don't necessarily add general purpose lanes for cars stopping distracted driving is another issue we did have a a bill that was approved and signed into law a year ago that reduced it reduced texting while driving made it a primary offense but you can still have your car and your you can still use your phone in your car while driving so there are some additional steps and senate president incoming center president wilton simpson is interested in looking at this so we're hopeful that we'll make some additional inroads on distracted driving next is a little bit of inside baseball but the legislature routinely passes laws or attempts to pass laws that change the makeup of metropolitan planning organizations and we think that decision should be done at the local level as the federal government intended and then finally supporting home rule on a number of fronts particularly vacation rentals the legislature has removed the authority of local governments to govern themselves and we stand with the suncoast league of cities and others to support home rule in a lot of its areas one example of that last year we had a bill that made it all the way through the house and almost all the way through the senate that would have restricted our ability to have the flashing yellow beacons the rectangular rapid flashing beacons at mid-block crossings and you see those throughout pinellas county it would have required that those bill those beacons be turned red and if they couldn't be turned red within one year that they'd be removed from that location these are governed by the u.s government and they would not be able to be turned red certainly not within a year and so that was a bad bill that would have put the onus on the local government to pay the cost of removing all of these and we have over 400 in pinellas county and they are very safe measures to facilitate people crossing the street and you probably can't put a traffic signal where many of these are located so we expect this bill to come back we've heard that it will come back and we would ask for support in continuing to resist this one some legislative issues to monitor for 2021 we have heard that there's at least one city in pinellas county that would like to broaden the ability of local governments to use the penny for pinellas to fund affordable housing currently that cannot be used for anything other than land acquisition so we expect that bill to be filed this year certainly the budget reductions due to covet 19 our forefront of our legislative session this year we've already seen about a 1.5 billion dollar reduction in transportation funding through sales tax losses and gas tax losses to the state so we're working to prevent substantial cuts in our work program for transportation and you can see this list here but again restricting vacation rentals is something that we want to see restored on the ability of local governments to at least regulate that and then also to provide state funding for resiliency and resilience planning one of the things that we deal with a lot is earmarked legislative earmarks and these are requests directly to a legislative delegation member to put something in the budget on behalf of the local government when it comes to transportation this does present a problem for us because earmarks come out of money that's already allocated to the transportation trust fund so they don't grow the funding pie in essence it's robbing peter to pay paul earmarks that are local projects force other priority projects that are already on the party list out and if the governor vetoes the earmark project that money is gone from the budget it doesn't get restored so the budget is just simply reduced by that amount and dot the florida dot is prohibited from working on that project for a year so for instance if the money is already being spent on design and you ask for an earmark for construction and it's vetoed the dot has to stop the design work too at least for a year and then finally earmarked projects are only for one phase of a project so if you ask for an earmark for say design but you're still in the planning phase and you need planning money then that money really can't be used that way and we had that problem on the memorial causeway bridge recently about a year or two ago where we had an earmark for design but we didn't even have a concept and so without a planning concept the city of clearwater was at odds with the dot on the design and ultimately the project did not advance so be careful what you asked for it's really important you ask for the right thing and just last year we saw that a goodwill earmark for our regional transit authority meant that our local transit agency lost one million dollars that was slated for a project that it had funding for and another earmark in hillsborough county eliminated five safety projects because when an earmark is granted and approved in the budget the florida department of transportation has to fund that project and they are looking especially in a lean year for ways to make up that revenue so we can work with you and help if you are looking and thinking about an earmark reach out to us and we can work with you to find other sources of funds if possible for instance safety funds through our highway safety improvement program and safe routes to schools can be used one of our grant programs can be used or we could maybe work with the county or the state to prioritize the project higher on the list so if there's anything we can do to work with you on that i'm happy to help and finally i just want to let you know that i am a resource to the city um i'm happy to be helpful in any way possible we do deal with the congestion issue and i know mayor we've sat down a couple of times and we've worked with the county to extend some of the turn lanes and work with you on the feedback signs and other mechanisms to help facilitate the flow of traffic to the town and again we'll continue to do that and i'll open it up to any questions that you have for me and again i thank you for your time but first i want to thank you not only for this presentation but for the time that you gave our city you did as you said a couple times you did meet with myself and lynn reeves we um we worked on the traffic issues and i think i think it has made some difference i think they've been working on those lights and some of the other traffic flows um so that's been helpful i um i just wanted to and this is my personal opinion it's not something that our council has voted on or anything but that whole idea of the uh of the crossings and your resistance to that um please continue that uh i shudder to think what the traffic problems would be if we had to turn those all into lights and i think that's what the proposal was those that actually have to be stoplights we'd go from having one stoplight in our city to i think about four or five and i think gulf boulevard would just be an absolute nightmare so um it may work in certain cities and i think it may have its merit um but it it i don't think it works in all cities in a city like ours it would just it would just destroy the already you know not so good traffic on a weekend on this in the uh peak season so thank you i'm going to open it up and see if anyone what your comments of course and then if anybody else can counsel his comments mark uh wilt uh question for you on the weekends out here we're trying to get out of the side street uh in in bellar beach i don't care if you're south or north the north is worse trying to get out let's say i'm coming from the inner you know from on 22nd street trying to go south there's no way in the world that you can pull out of there safely with the speed at 40. i mean let's face it it's close to the 35 there's a five year five mile an hour leeway that means you've got traffic moving 40 miles an hour either way so pulling out and then you have the bicycles in the bicycle lane if you try to nose out in traffic to get somebody to try to be kind enough to let you out you get the worst looks in the world and they go in front of you and then they're in a line of being hit of more moving traffic i don't know what you can come up with as far as an idea to break the traffic long enough for someone to pull out of any of our streets on the north or south end or even go so far as to pull out our neighbors driveways that are on belar shore you can't it's just an unsafe situation so i suggested at one time to take the uh coast guard station and put a bridge in cross across the water you know just to alleviate some of the traffic i mean i know it's a crazy thing but you just mentioned earlier in the conversation you had some extra money well put another bridge in maybe that'll help you know make bellar beach a dead end so you can't go to clearwater i don't know what the answer is but please help us out in that situation thank you for that i certainly understand the frustration that you all have and um having lived in bel air blocks for a little while i i experienced it so i saw it from that side we will continue to work with you on what whatever we can do i'm not sure a new bridge is imminent but we can we can think about what that might do and some other mechanisms certainly speed management is an issue on gulf boulevard i just got done working with the city of indian rocks beach and they are working to reinforce the 30 mile an hour speed limits that they have through their town and when it's not congested you'd be surprised how many people are at 40 45 miles an hour we're going down south boulevard so i i hear you all right thank you very much jody shirley yeah just um thank you for the presentation it was very helpful but um some of the something you mentioned was that there's federal funding available for pedestrian crossings and i know this has been something we've talked about it might be something to discuss further at a work session but i think we need to add a couple of crosswalks because we have so many beach accesses and things like that that people are crossing um you know mid block and there's kind of some stretches between crosswalks that you know there's a good half mile in between and if you live on one of those side streets it's hard to get to the beach so just something we might want to um discuss further with you about that if you know the council is on board and we discuss it in a work session maybe we can bring you in once we talk about it if you have some specific locations in mind we'd be happy to look at those and work with the county on getting some type of device installed and one thing about those rapid flashing beacons they do they do create gaps in traffic for people needing to get out when they're when they're pressed so they they can't help yeah thank you that was it thank you so much for your help one area that i'm i express a concern about is if you're on gulf boulevard going south and you uh get to the light that crosses the causeway bridge there but we've created a bottleneck because the left turn lane that goes back across the causeway is often backed up and we have a traffic island there which causes uh a bottleneck right there and really prevent the traffic uh i've discussed with lynn ray's the possibility of changing that so that maybe there's there's actually three lanes at that stop light and maybe why not just convert a second lane to make that left turn as well and there's there's a merging a lane that comes north off of gulf boulevard to cross the causeway as well i mean perhaps just take a look at that intersection and see the better ways to handle that traffic and that maybe move uh the traffic returning back across the causeway a little bit quicker that's all i have thank you okay so just so i understand you're talking about the southbound left turn to go back over the causeway that's that's correct there's there's there's three lanes there's a there's a left turn lane that takes you back across the causeway to the the main land mass but then there's just two lanes that go south and why not just convert a second lane to a left turn lane and maybe unclog the traffic that backs up because of a uh that traffic island that was just placed too close to the intersection okay i'll i'll talk with the county about that that may be something we can work with and you i think you do have a little bit of right of way to work with there in that location thank you thank you anybody else for first comments i see marv has his hand up i'm going to come back to him but anybody else for first comments okay more you know glenn i don't want to argue with that on that i know the island has been a discussion well if you could um get in on the conversation or at least listen um we've talked about it but the problem is the people on those first two streets going northbound after the turn off the causeway going north on gulf boulevard it's now that we've added a you can make a right turn with that red light there's a continuous flow of traffic and nobody in living in those two streets on the weekend can get out of there so that you know at least with the island there it blocks the cars at least they get in the middle lane to go south but without that island there you can't so and glenn excuse me for you know getting in on this one but maybe you have two lanes going south and you've got the ability on that intersection to take the two eastbound lanes a turning lane in the middle lane and turn those into the causeway you could it's possible so and then the far right lane would be a continuous flow but you could make the center lane either a left turn or straight ahead and that may help because you have enough room on causeway boulevard to pull another car in there we have that ability on the southbound side where there's ability there to make a left hand or right hand turn with that southbound lane so you could intermingle those too that's a possibility it's something to think about thank you thank you i'd like to go ahead and make a comment this is councilmember slope is there any way we can just put this on the work session agenda i mean obviously we need to have a more lengthy or discussion about it and um so we can get it also get a consensus with the entire council so i was wondering if we can just move this topic to a work session mr reeves or patty that's a great idea yes it seems a bad consensus i'm just i just want i'm looking for acknowledgement from either lynn or patty yes everyone's nodding yes with the calendar there yeah we can we can add it to the work session okay very well thank you mr mr blind uh sorry to interrupt can you make me host again so that uh i hadn't forgotten but i'm not sure i know how so let me try and figure this out i'll click on my right click on my name and or where it says more and make me host did you have comments because glenn has his hand up no no i just didn't want him to disappear and okay and i just saw something pop up that says you're the host glenn gunn you did it yeah i just wanted to uh to say that my comments were not to tell you how to build the watch i'm just trying to identify an area that i think there may be some uh some opportunities for us to uh manage to get more efficiency out of the traffic flow there that's that's all let's give it to the experts to figure out how to do it thank you understood thank you very much any other council comments of them and open it up to the citizens um dave i guess you're the one polling the citizens are there any citizens that wish to be heard on this or speak to wilt mars started calling you wilt now i'm doing it there are no uh citizens who are requesting a call right is there any last comments or comments before we thank mr blanton again i have one sure i i think the underlying issue is not going to be gulf boulevard no matter what you do this problem will continue and will only continue to get worse until something is done with the city of clearwater beach and their over development this is never going to stop they keep building hotels i don't know what they've done with our code but they are wrecking our town with their traffic and uh it is absolutely unfair to this city and something needs to be done about it you can put eight lanes out there they will fill them all good point dave okay anyone else thank you again um we'll we'll meet um in a council session and a work session and most likely i'm pretty certain our city manager will be back in touch with you with uh whatever comes of that and we look forward to working with you in that in the future and thank you for all the work you did for us in the past here great thank you so much thanks again for coming out tonight all right all right what we have now is the uh consent agenda as we've adjusted it so we have um if i have this correct we have on the what remains on the consent agendas

agenda is does anyone have a problem with him asking this question i see no objection proceed marv glenn yeah marv the uh the the curbs on louisa are are not in bad shape and the other issue is the funding that we have available but so we went through and looked at the streets with the worst curbs and that's what we're replacing with the funding that we have available for the curbs all right i did have some neighbors there complaining about the cul-de-sac area on the east side yeah i mean we can look at that but we looked at the curves they weren't yeah no i know they've been replaced a number of years ago you got a couple little spots but it's not bad right it's just the end of the end of the louisa that kind of in questionnaire that's all okay are we ready to call the question for

you please call the roll councilmember gatos council member shirley aye councilmember swope hi councilmember aki hi councilmember beam bye vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so the consent agenda is past seven to zero all of those items number five seven eight nine eleven twelve sixteen and seventeen are all passed city manager please take the appropriate actions on all of them thank you mayor you're welcome thank you for setting that up okay so now we go into the regular agenda what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take them in the order of the ones that got removed from the consent agenda so we're going to have um we have item 6 item 10 13 14 15 and then we'll get on what's typed as regular agenda on our agenda packet over here that's number number 18. so the first item is on the consent agenda on the regular agenda is approval of the september 9th 2020 city council meeting um and first budget public hearing minutes do i have a motion so look glenn gunn makes the motion a second second peter swope is the second glenn gunn comments council comments yes i i pulled this one from the consent agenda only because what i would like to do is i read through it there's a little ambiguity here because it opens as the me was called to order at 6 pm by vice mayor glenn gunn and yet in the world caller shows everyone there so what i would like to ask is that we we clarify in the uh the opening of the administrator why uh the vice president over the meeting and yet the mayor's attendance so i i understand i would just like to note that the mayor was out of pocket for whatever reason he was stuck in traffic or whatever and that he was calling in and also when i was notified that the uh i would be presided over the me that's all i ask so entertain why the fights was presiding over the meeting vice the mayor instead of the mayor i'm sorry and also when the notification came down like all i asked and to respond to glenn gunn that's an accurate uh description i was stuck in traffic i was on time i called in telephonically but i'm because i was driving the car and could not see anyone there was no way i could possibly host the meeting so the vice mayor hosted it until i returned back and i think i was back in about a half an hour or so um so that's i have i have no objection so the first um amendment or adjustment is to annotate that or what we just said i'm going to do this as if we can get consensus we can do this as one uh amendment it's like we did with the other um with the other motion it's up to the council i'll take them individually if you want but counsel i'm going to have a couple but i have a couple things i want to add dave guys give me a thumbs up so see if you agree if not we can split them out so anyone else i had some comments but um did anyone else have any comments on the minutes yes no i wanted to just add there was comments by mr mark goldman and i i guess the audio for some reason didn't record or was erased or i don't know what happened but it's not on the um it's not on our website and um so what i recall mr goldman saying um was that he had received a letter and uh and again we're not going to talk about the detail of the letter but the letter pertained to the litigation and he said that um he was well the quotes that i remembered and what i wrote down after i got home was he said this is um this is extortion and this is blackmail and i think those are pretty strong words so i think that should be reflected in here and he said that he wanted to subpoena the documents i think the rest of this is correct we wanted to subpoena documents and records from the individual and then he called upon council and the uh and the city to become involved along with the police so um that's the way i remember that and i i know other people heard the same thing i would like to just change it to reflect those direct comments and that he wanted to subpoena documents and records anybody hear anything different i think the unfortunate thing is there's no recording of it so it's hard to quote when we don't have a recording of it all right i just remember those quotes and again so any other i got it i did gather his hands first hang on great as well go ahead david i i think the problem is is that miss gentry is probably a little confused as to when her verbatim recorder should be turned on and when it should be turned off i don't know exactly what he stated because i can't see it and i can't hear it but we just want to be careful uh i i've never actually heard uh citizen comments being entered into the into the minutes so maybe there have been a few times but uh we're not on public record uh or they're not on public record the same way that we are whenever they're dressing we're strictly recording minutes so i i don't know what the best way is to handle this but i just thought i'd add that uh rita swope is next glenn gunn yes i just wanted to say i don't want to see anything added off of somebody's memory i think if we want to reach out to him and ask him what he said then that's fine so we can get an exact quote but since we don't have it on audio or video i don't want to go with the format that we're going to just put in words that he may or may not have said glenn gunn i i agree with rita i don't think we're in a position where we can uh based on recollection of a uh a conversation or a state made a month ago enter words for somebody else into a public record that that doesn't make any sense and i think i think that's uh pretty slickly slow to uh start down so i i'm against that completely that's it thank you okay anyone else all right so we're going to split the uh well i i can't make a a proposal i know what i heard there were witnesses who heard it um and obviously it doesn't matter whether it's in the record or not so i'm going to ask that a motion be made for that and we'll split them out so we have my motion to annotate the record for the comments of mr goldman as as i heard of them and others hurt them and um that is the first motion does anybody want to make that motion no one makes the motion that dies then we have glenn gunn's comments um and mr gunn say stay them again please yes that the vice mayor was asked to preside over the meeting initially informed two minutes before the meeting started because the mayor was stuck in traffic and although he was able to call in he had fallen he was not in a position to preside over the meeting that's your motion do we have a second [Music] any comments okay so this is the uh uh this is to the um amendment only as glenn gunn stated it i'm not going to say it verbatim but basically to explain that he was hosting the meeting because i was stuck in traffic and he was informed uh a couple minutes prior to 6 pm i don't know what the exact time was i was driving so i i i kind of don't think we should be putting times in unless somebody has an exact time it's immaterial but you were informed right before the meeting i know that because there were some technical difficulties on getting in um so uh i would agree to you know this says if we're just going to say why you're hosting it um anyway uh so the question before us is stated exactly how you want it mr gun you're going to make me repeat it now well because i don't want to call your questions on this one the the meeting was called war at 6pm by vice mayor gunn uh because miramazo was stuck in traffic and unable to preside over the meeting initially mayor guy our vice mayor gun was uh notified a couple minutes before the meeting and uh presided over the meeting i i'm fine okay so that's that's what the question um we're just voting on that question to amend the minutes for that to add that question to add that piece of information to it a yes vote we'll add that in that we'll then we'll approve the entire minutes madam clark councilmember rocky yes council member beam aye councilmember gattis council member shirley aye councilmember swobe hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so that edition is now added to the minutes patty will make that change once we approve these minutes um and now the motion is and now the um question is to approve the minutes as amended item six approval of the september 9 2020 city council minutes as amended um that's also the first budget public hearing minutes adam clerk please call councilmember rocky yes councilmember bean hi councilmember gaddis hi councilmember shirley i'm councilmember slow hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so the minutes as amended are approved patty you will make that change and then supplement the official record correct yes okay thank you give me one second i'm mixing out everything we've completed we're through the first page we're now on item 10 which was moved into the regular agenda that is the authorization to advertise a request for proposal for a digital sign for the community center the explanation is to upgrade to digital recommended by the communication advisory committee staff recommends replacement to digital following damage to existing signs so i need a motion first phil luke rita swope makes the motion and a second by mark beam it's open for comments beginning with rita i'll defer to the city manager lynn reeves mr reeves you have the floor yeah this is just a request uh to try to start the process because as you know we are our sign was damaged we have filed an insurance claim and this is just a way to try to expedite what we're doing moving forward what will happen basically is we'll get some designs and the console will make the recommendation of the final design i have a question for you i know we've kicked this around a few times about this digital sign i was not on council the last time a digital sign was proposed in the city but as i recall it it brought out an outpouring of um of sentiment to city hall and not all of it was positive in fact i think most of it was negative i realized it was in a different location i realized it might be a different sign but um i also realized that the citizens may feel strongly about this we're in a residential neighborhood we have houses surrounding us um and i'm my concern is that we're moving forward without really having the opportunity to to discuss this fully i realize you want to just get a price at this point but are we getting prices for regular signs too because i want this to be a fair fight here and i want to hear from the citizens before we authorize anything on a go forward basis there's no harm in getting a price that's not a problem but i don't want the rumor to get out that it's a done deal and we're putting up a sign you know i think the folks need to have their input on this so i glenn i'll come to you next i just want to ask the story of his comment on that well well mayor i i know you weren't on console at the time that the issue was where the sign location was actually at the meeting that they discussed um they didn't have a problem with us if we did a digital sign in front of city hall at that time and the the issue was where they were trying to we were talking about using the penny for pinellas money on gulf boulevard we had this discussion with the communications committee and there are some things going forward it's kind of ironic that the sign was destroyed and so it's a it's a time that we need to go forward with some concepts at least and we will bring those designs to you uh to look at before we go forward with any uh pricey lynn i know you you told me that night when it fell down and i had asked you is there is it salvageable i i imagine by seeing this it's probably not but can i hear that from you no it uh we we went out and got some quotes to replace it as it exists and they came in i think the lowest was 13 we got one that was 17-5 and we got one was 20 000. they said you need to start over glenn gone i know you had your hand up i just one one comment and and one question yes i would say the most current input you have and they are from the citizens because that came the recommendation came from the communications committee which was comprised majority wise by our citizens and residents so that's the opinion of the residents most currently and secondly a question just to uh city manager is do you have a a ruffle or a magnitude for what you're setting aside for the budget for this just just a rough idea well we have thirty thousand dollars set aside in the budget through this year the sign was insured for eight thousand dollars because that's what it cost when it was built however we have a i call it a blanket that they will pay us for you know whatever the best price we can get to replace it apples to apples and uh so i'm expecting we'll probably get from insurance 10 or 11 000 i'm guessing and we what the communication committee recommended at the time we were going to use that existing sign and put it in a v-shape well now we'll be able to create a v-shaped sign that people can see from both directions so going forward i think that amount of money should take care of it thank you any other council god jody shirley yeah just when you're getting pricing i i agree with mayor manzo that we need to do both digital versus standard standard monument sign comparisons we know what we're looking at i do recall the prior digital signs conversation and there were a number of residents not in support of it and i wasn't in big support of it i don't think that you know we're we're a small town and you know i know it's a good use for communication but then the flip side is i'm not so sure that um it's the best use of communication when you're communicating to all the people that use our road for access for beach access right so um so we're communicating through all the surrounding neighborhoods um whatever it is to try and tell our residents so i don't know i'm not i'm kind of hard on the whole digital sign um but so i just want to make sure we're getting some good comparisons and that we we ask for some scales or renderings so that when we look at it as a council we know what we're looking at because the last ones we got we had no information like that so that would be helpful yeah yeah i actually i have a scaled rendering of the existing sign and you know we'll have that to look at also but uh we'll try to get some other concepts dave i'll come to you in a second jody do you want to make a propose do you want to make an amendment proposal to make this for both uh rfp for a digital and a um i don't know what you call it conventional sign yeah i would call it a monument sign is what we you know what i would call it so i would say yeah a digital sign and a conventional monument sign so i'd like to amend the um request for proposal to include those two items and be certain that it includes scale drawings of both so it'll be it'll be um authorized to advertise a request for proposal for a digital and conventional monument sign for the community center um with scale drawings all right well that that one the scale drawings have to come anyway because you got to get a permit so that's that's really cool we had this last time you presented this to us to look at is it okay is it okay jody to eliminate the scale drawings for the rfp yes i believe so okay so we have a proposal by jody shirley to amend this item to now include a conventional monument sign that's the uh that's the adjustment i now have to take that in its order so do we have a second on that so i had the opportunity to speak um are we i'm gonna come back to you but i have to i have to take this she has an amendment right now so i have to deal with the amendment first then we're gonna get back to you i have not forgotten about you do i have a second on jody's amendment second i'm joined second hit so now the discussion goes on just the amendment only dave we will come back to you on the regular sign we haven't we haven't voted on that yet so this is just on the amendment to add conventional monument sign to the rfp package i'll i'll jump in and jody i agree with you 100 i i said it thank you for supporting me on this side i think let's let's get both of them so we have something to compare dave gaddis you had your hand up uh yes uh uh just so that uh just to clarify i know that we're we're voting on on getting uh two different types of quotes and that's fine uh basically i think what was determined i'm going to try to refresh everyone's memory was that we had two we actually had three problems with the digital sign or with our current sign and a digital sign the first one was that uh the current sign was too small and it faced uh inappropriately for the for the street um as far as digital sign goes everyone was afraid that it was going to be colorful and bright and obnoxious with if if you go to a the conventional sign like we had the problem is is you have small type and you uh basically can't read it you have to slow down to be able to read that sign uh so what was determined and it's been brought up several times and uh and lynn even showed us examples was more of a like a tablet with a paper white display only it may be backwards i may be getting that wrong but it was a lot of flashy color it was the only way that we could get a sign that would fit in the footprint and yet have big enough lettering to for people to be able to read it which is you you show several like basically a scrolling uh several uh messages uh within a few second period and and that was that's basically what the communication committee came up with and i believe that it was also agreed upon earlier i i really don't know why this went to the wayside but i don't have a problem with uh with getting both quotes but i i thought we had already nailed this one down uh so uh lynn correct me if i'm wrong but uh that that's what it sounded like yeah i i was kind of under the impression that what we were talking about was just making sure we got a sign that was readable and unfortunately the previous sign we get complaints constantly that it wasn't readable they couldn't read it and part of that could be the location which unfortunately that's the location we have and the other issue would be the i think people are looking at a digital sign as something like uh they have at the football game and that's not what we were trying to get we were trying to get where basically it was a scrolling thing that said tonight there's a console meeting at 6 p.m tomorrow there's you know whatever we put on there so what you're going to get with an rfp with this you're going to get apples and oranges just so you're aware you're going to get apples and oranges and yes a monument sign is going to cost less money but is it going to improve the communications i guess is the concern i have because of the comments we continually get about there's i can't read the signs i'm going to try and focus the discussion the amendment in front of us right now we don't have to decide tonight which one is better it's simply to get two bids and that's all we're asking for right now and i realize there's various merits to each one um but right now it's it's to make the amendment to add to get two rfps i do think there's going to be a you know somewhat lengthy discussion as to which is the best alternative when we get those bids but it gives us more to compare so um we have a bit we have a um we have an amendment we have a second any other comments on the amendment only this is to add the city monument sign to the package and he's any i now i'm going to go to this uh to the citizens citizens the only topic right now we're going to come back to the sign itself but right now the only topic is on the amendment we're adding the amendment on the floor is to add the conventional monument sign to the bid package man i do have one i have peggy okay and uh let me okay she should be able to talk you'll have to unmute there you go i'm unmuted uh this is peggy gatliff 228 then auto drive i too am against a bright and obnoxious sign so i would like to add or include or hope that we will stay with the traditional sign i think we're trying to commute to communicate to our city members and not to the general public going up and down the beach boulevard thank you ms gatlin any other citizen comments back to council on wait i think i saw a hand i have a jane lagner yes go ahead all right hold on all right go ahead jane yes i two uh am about jane lochte three three two zero hibiscus driveway so i too am against a a bright and obnoxious digital sign but that is old technology technology today allows for the brightness to be to automatically be adjusted based on the light level so that in at night it is very much reduced in its intensity because you don't need that intensity like doing a bright day and just because it's a digital does not mean it has to be obnoxious we have control over what we would put on it and how it would be displayed so you know if it was still had the old sign up you know is it worth putting money into to bring it up to digital maybe not but since it's been destroyed by the storm where a different situation thank you thank you uh any other citizen comments i have none okay then i'll come back to council with jody shirley getting the last word glenn gunn go ahead i i think we are jumping to specifics and rather than say hey digital non-digital old style new style new tech why don't we just come up with some overarching things and what i'm saying is whatever solution we come up with it needs to be readable by people passing it in their cars it needs to be unobtrusive and fit within the decor of biller beach it needs to be flexible and usage it would be nice if if if an emergency comes up from his vehicle or even at home lyn reads or the city clerk can get on their ipad and change the sign right on the spot and uh last of all it should be cost effective and uh so far as recurring costs electrical power or whatever and manpower wise versus having to get out there and change numbers and letters and stuff i mean it's just electronic and done from the from your office on an ipad or a computer so rather than say hey it has to be this let's come up with some overarching things of what we desire rather than just jump to hey have to be digital or non-digital or whatever and i i'd be happy to sit down and help out the city manager has come up with some overarching uh specs on this thing yeah and again tonight and marv i've got you coming up this is just for an rfp we're not deciding which one is best marv go ahead all right conversation going back a number of years so then you may remember it jody you may remember it we used to have a sign come and come in the west on causeway boulevard that says welcome to biller beach a sign was moved lynn if i'm correct to the marina yeah and we no longer have a welcome to beller beach sign so would it be smart to do something across the street from bellar beach i don't think you have the the right of way to do that what we had at one time oh yeah but the bridge was built and the road got yeah that's why that sign was taken out of there i i know i remember any other comments on adding the uh the conventional monument sign to the bid package jody has the last word before you vote on the amendment only jody you know i i just i think what we have here doesn't give us a whole lot of outline and i'm assuming that lin's going to write a better rfp before it goes out so i would say that you know we do need to see some versatility in the signage and you know that's why you hire a fine company let them show us some designs and you know you put the specs in the rfp and let's go with it so i just would like to see some variation that's it thank you and i'm going to call the question um so this is on the amendment only the proposal right now is to the we will add to item 10 the requirement that a bit also be approved uh be received for what we call a conventional monument sign if you vote yes for that that phrase will also be added to item 10 which we'll be voting on next madam clerk please call the roll council members hello hi councilmember shirley hi councilmember gaddis councilmember beam hi councilmember aki aye vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so the amendment passes seven to zero and i will read the new question i will open it up if there's any other questions on any other uh comments on that we still have to go out to the or the citizens and then back but what we're now uh before our board is number 10 authorization to advertise a request for proposal for a digital sign for the community center and for a conventional monument sign for the community center back to council for comments gwen who couldn't you just say rather than differentiate digital embodiment why not just a replacement sign amendment as conventional monument signs unless you want to make another amendment and i'll propose a another amendment where we just strike any differentiation between a digital sign or a monument sign and just go out for an rfp for a replacement sign okay anyone seconding that i'll second it they've got a second it's open for discussion uh glengon you brought it so you have first opportunity to speak no i'm just trying to streamline the process rather than again tell the the experts who build signs uh how to build a watch let them come to us and say hey we've scoped out your situation and these these are the what you tried when you're trying to uh get out of the flexibility ease of uh changing their sign unobtrusive let them come to us and tell us what their recommendations are so to understand robin i'm coming right to you i just want to make sure i understand frame this properly so you want this to read if your amendment passes authorization to collect correct any of this that's wrong authorization to advertise a request proposal for sign for the community center i will replace that sign replacement sign okay all right and then mark b i think you guys are making this way more complicated i mean really digital non-digital a sign i think the amendment that jody passed is good because it gives specifics digital and non-digital those are really the only two options so i would say can we just keep this agenda going before my kids graduate high school this is ridiculous let's keep it going guys sorry thank you morphy we came up we wanted a v-shape sign that was what um it was talked about so it could be done either way digital or conventional one sign it's either you add a bottom piece to make it digital or you add a bottom piece to make it conventional simplify it that's all any other council comments i i'm with robin i think we have a good thing to vote on right now and we have 20 more things to do so um but that's just my opinion so are you i'm sorry i withdraw my proposal you're withdrawing it okay let's just move forward okay we will move forward so we're back to the original item 10 uh not the original the amended item 10 that calls for a digital sign and a two bids for digital sign and a conventional monument signed is there any other comments on that any citizen comments just seeing no citizens no citizen comments uh mr gattis no okay back to council uh i believe i believe about half an hour ago it was rita slope who made this motion so um dave gaddis and then rita has last word the only thing that i ask is before we make a decision we do uh review what the communication committee recommended so take that into consideration and uh that's all i've got to say right and we're just this is just for an rfp this is not for we're not deciding what we're buying tonight we don't even have a number in mind right now rate of smoke do you have anything dad nothing let's go and call for the question i will do that okay so the amended item 10 reads authorization to advertise a request for proposal for a digital sign uh and a conventional monument sign for the community center yes vote we'll get that rfp for both of those madam clerk please call uh please call the roll council member aki aye councilmember beam all right council member gattis council member shirley aye councilmember 12 hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manza all right so passes seven to zero um uh city manager would you please get the two bids to our rfps out and uh keep us advised as to what's happening please yeah we'll have to bring a couple concepts to you before we do that but i think that's good and i think we want to get them on the citizen to the citizens too on that website okay let me move on to item 13 um i'm not sure if it was me or somebody else that asked for this one doesn't really matter but um we moved it out into the regular agenda it's authorization to suspend bid requirements for the tennis court fence replacement it's to accept the west coast fence corp proposal 18 920 it's in the fy 2021 capital budget first i need a motion mars has made the motion rita smoke a second marv go ahead all right glenn that question for you we talked about possible in the future a roadway between the frontier building and the tennis court what if we were just take those two entrances to the tennis court and put them on the east side and the west side we are recommending moving it to one entrance on the west side one entrance only on the west side yes okay fine that's it thank you anyone else i do have a question glenn uh lynn could you just explain exactly what is meant when you want to suspend the bid requirements what what is being suspended and why do you want to do that well you know going out for a bid for a project like this is is something that uh typically isn't done and when we do our code review committee i'm going to bring to them you know we need to update our purchasing guidelines because what it's what it says is anything over ten thousand dollars uh you gotta go to to bid on so we can be more efficient by getting proposals which we got three we went out and got three proposals that's more efficient than setting up a bid document advertising it spending the time money uh for advertising a newspaper and doing things like that and that's why i asked you to suspend the bid requirements because it requires that through through a bid and for projects like this we'll use the fence as an example we could have jumped off a county contract but that county contract was through smith fence it was 22 000 so it's cheaper to get those proposals and it's more efficient and that's that's why we ask you to spend the bid requirements but when we do the code review i'm going to ask you to adjust those because they were probably last adjusted 20 some years ago that's all great information and so i would ask that like for some of these follow-on ones like 14 and 15. i mean if you just preface it with the fact that it for the sake of efficiency and cost savings we want to do it this way i mean that that kind of makes it in my mind a no-brainer thanks for explaining that i appreciate it when glenn's question actually was what i was going to ask so i think we're thinking the same i i was wondering why we were suspending this our rules despite the fact that they may be antiquated do call for there has to be a unique circumstance it says where the council finds unique circumstances to establish that competitive bidding is not in the best interest of the city that's when we can do this and the reason why i had asked him why we had to move this stuff was because i didn't it wasn't obvious to me in reading this so for the future i think we probably could keep using consent agenda if you could explain those unique circumstances in listening to what you've said it seems like it is a unique circumstance in fact you found that the county price is actually in excess of what the private prices which makes you wonder what our county folks are doing but um that's great so i'm totally good with this i think we have the unique circumstances and if the council agrees um we can uh well we have to of course ask for citizen comments but we'll move this forward that was my questions and concerns anyone else dave gaddis i i think to summarize lynn uh basically whenever a job does not raise enough money for the bidder they're not going to bid is that what you're saying right because it's because a bid is a you know we use a bid for you're going to approve a couple bids later in the thing like for the storm water and stuff and a lot of times the the those bids you may not even get any bids where you can go get a proposal they're willing to hand you a proposal or you can go off of a county or state contract but i've always been of the opinion that yeah i'll take your contract the county contract but i'm going to look elsewhere too because sometimes you're not the cheapest and sometimes they are depends instead of jumping out there on a a contract which we could have done and just brought it to you and said hey we're going to take it off this contract but as you can see it was i think it was like it was four thousand dollars difference so now i'm looking at it more is the efficiency and cost savings if we can find it best value any other council comments uh any citizen with any citizens like to comment i don't see anybody i see no citizen comments okay then i'll close citizen comments and come back um to the uh to the council for final word marking it was um it was uh your uh your motion no um that's fine no other no other comments for me thank you okay so the question before us is authorization to spend the bid requirements for the tennis court fence replacement uh the city manager will accept the west coast fence proposal 18 920 41 cents this money is in the fy 2021 capital budget a yes vote allows him to proceed madam clerk council member councilmember shirley aye councilmember swoe hi councilmember aki aye councilmember bean all right vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo hi so if that's the seven to zero um city manager you're authorized to proceed forward with that uh to suspend the requirements and go forward with that west coast fence proposal item 14 authorization to suspend bid requirements for tennis court resurfacing uh this is the acceptance of welch tennis courts inc proposal thirteen thousand three hundred twenty dollars funding is in the fy capital budget will someone make a motion please don't move if daddy's makes the motion do we have a second second mark beam is second dave davis i i think we're in the exact same position we were in the last agenda item which it's not worth taking uh time is money and companies are not going to bid on a small project like this lynn reeves is that your understanding and is that what you want to tell us yes uh same situation we went out and got three proposals uh the the best proposal was from welch tennis court and uh they are uh in this area they are one of the premier tennis court resurfacing companies i mean they're predominantly used and actually these three quotes came in very close together but they were still a little bitter and welch has a better reputation a lot better a lot better good any other comments by council any citizens would like to comment no i see none come back to counsel any comments finishing with dave gaddis i have none no final comments so item number 14 before us is to authorization to suspend the bid requirements for tennis court resurfacing if you vote yes city manager is going to accept the welch tennis court inc proposal 13 220 funding is in our 2021 capital budget madam clerk please call the roll council member shirley i'm council member swope councilmember aki aye councilmember beam councilmember gaddis i'm sorry that was broken up was that an eye yes yes okay thank you councilmember gaddis vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so it passes seven to zero the author of the uh city manager you're authorized to proceed forward with the wells tech welch tennis court hundred proposal 13 resurfacings we will now move to item fifteen authors authorization to suspend bid requirements for cipp repair of stormwater pipe on donato drive this is to accept the granite inliner llc proposal eighteen thousand two hundred dollar funding is in the twenty twenty one capital budget do i have a motion swap makes the motion who else was second okay second dave gaddis read the slope i think it's probably the exact same thing as 13 and 14 so i don't have any other comments about it anyone else mark b glenn we did talk to the prior meeting um in regard to taking cores of the streets to make sure that the underlying material is enough to hold except for the areas that were dug up during the undergrounding process to make sure the ground is firm enough this this project is slip lining it's not a new pipe i'm sorry this is slip lining and i don't know if everybody knows what slip lining is i'm just gonna ask you to explain to everyone who doesn't know i know what it is look ahead i'm thinking about something else i'm well aware of what you're doing sorry i'm my mind is cultural yeah let's tell everyone else who's listening what what slip lining is slip linings putting a pipe inside a pipe and they they slip line pipes like as an example in this case it's between two homes we can't go up and dig two homes up for the pipes but we can slip line it and it will reinforce the pipe and last for many many more years so that's that's really what it is it's like putting uh blowing a balloon inside it it explodes and lines the pipe sort of and the prices we got the person that actually has a contract for it said they were too busy they wouldn't be able to do it but the low price was eighteen thousand the next was 20 and the next one was 25 000. so there again you know efficiencies and uh this company uh we we've checked them out and they're they're a good company also anyone else have any comments or questions i'll open it up to the citizens then there are none no citizen questions we bring it back to council with rita swope will have the last word and he counts the comments before rita goes rita you have the last word no other comments just call for the question i will do that uh item 15 authorization to an authorization to suspend the bid requirements for cipp repair of stormwater pipe on donato drive this will be the acceptance of the granite inliner llc proposal eighteen thousand two hundred dollars the funding is in the twenty twenty one capital budget matterpipe yes vote allows us to proceed madam clerk councilmember swo hi councilmember aki hi councilmember beam councilmember gattis hi councilmember shirley hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so thousand seven to zero uh city manager you're authorized to go forward with the granite inliner proposal contract eighteen thousand two hundred dollars okay folks we're moving right along we're actually in what we used to call the regular agenda item number 18 we have consideration of appointment of park and rec board members and alternate board members so we have applicants for board member we have carly e devlin and nicole sussman and then we have applicants for alternate board members deborah debbie key and nora kodak i don't know if anyone's here we don't normally have to do um these these folks have applied already so they're automatically on for uh for uh vote we always turn it over uh and i'll ask that we continue with this we always turn it over to any of them who have come here first and then people can make any comments afterwards so is are any of these individuals in the uh audience and would they like to address the council no one is asking to speak mayor okay oh wait a minute hold on i do have one uh it's it's jeff again i know it's somebody else but let me go ahead and okay but that's debbie keith i think that's muted now it's open hey council i just want to thank you for being uh considered uh my husband and i have lived here for over 16 years and we love beverly beach and i look forward to being part of this board the members that i met the positivity and the great ideas um really makes it easy for me to say yes to being part of your team thank you thank you are there any is there anyone else in the uh citizens who wish to comment any citizens anyone on council have any comments before we go to a vote now here's my problem normally we do these votes by paper ballot and i'm not sure how we do this because you have to have individual votes and what this is is we have first we have the applicants for board member and you can vote for up to two so you don't have to vote for anyone you could vote for one you could vote for two um and then the same thing for the alternate but normally we do this with paper ballot uh madam clerk what is your recommendation i would put that to the city attorney you know based on what we're doing with the virtual meetings being allowed so i don't see how you have any way around simply going through and asking each council member whether they're going to vote for none one or two i mean i i don't know how you could do it any other way there is a ballad in their packet robin's holding it up what is the preference i have no problem going individually you know just having each person pulled individually or would you like to write it out and hold it up to the screen i can't like robin when you did that i could see holding the paper up but i couldn't see what would have been written on it so it might just be easier particularly since there's two and two my suspicion is it'll everyone will be on these boards in about two minutes so um maybe we just want to go individually and just ask each person everybody jody's nodding glenn's nodding everyone yeah so okay so madam clerk if you will poll and i'm going to ask you to just pull in a random order okay just so it should be different so let's go first for the applicants for board member just pull in a random order you do not have to end with me just end wherever you end okay okay um i'm not sure what you're wanting me to ask or do they understand what they're going to say okay let me let me frame the question so basically we have two applicants for board member each council member can vote up to two you're not compelled to vote for anyone if you don't wish so uh this is the um the uh clerk the city clerk will ask who you uh wish to vote for just give her one or two or well zero one or two names how's that okay mayor manzo i vote for both members carly devlin and nicole sussman by smeargun two thumbs up council member guys that one freeze mr gun yes thank you affirmative for devlin and sussman okay and i thank them for stepping up councilmember gattis evelyn and sussman councilmember shirley evelyn anne councilmember swope devlin and sussman councilmember aki evelyn ann sutsman councilmember beam devlin and susan okay that completes it so each person received unanimous votes and approval congratulations carly devlin and nicole sussman um you're now on the uh your um applicant for board membership has been approved you're on the parks and rec board and i'm sure they'll be having a meeting soon and you'll be able to participate in that so the next part of this is for the alternate board member same thing we're going to ask whether you support deborah debbie keith and nora kodak you could vote for one none or both john clerk council member beams council member aki eats in kodak vice mayor gunn even kodak council member swope kodak mayor ranzo kodak council member shirley and kodak and councilmember gaddis kodak and keith you had to do it in reverse order okay everyone it passes unanimously receive seven votes receive seven votes you're the alternate members and you will also be at the uh well you might have to be at the next meeting so you might want to check in with them okay everybody doing okay it's 8 20 we've been going for two hours and 20 minutes everybody all right we'll keep forging ahead dave daddis i'd like to request a three-minute uh break three minute break everybody okay with that i have 8 22 on my computer so approximately 8 25 let's everyone be back okay so we're back on the record it's uh item 19 the consideration of resolution 2020-17 a resolution of the city council of the city of bel air beach florida pertaining to the creation of an ad hoc committee pursuant to the provisions of section 2.102 of the city code consisting of three residents of the city and two members of the city council to conduct a review of specified sections of the city code and establishing an effective date this is to establish a committee to review the city code do i have a motion so moved moved by glenn gunn second second i think that was jody shirley okay uh glenn gunn i'll defer to uh city manager lynn reeves yeah mayor and console this is uh a request that the console had discussed a couple months ago and we said we'd do it in the fall and we advertised for two plus months we only got three applicants and now we only have two applicants because one uh opted out tonight and then we would still need the city council members that would want to participate i'm going to suggest to council that perhaps we maybe discussed this a little further because in looking at this the first thing that came to mind was that we normally put together a little charter and explain to our committees our ad hoc committees exactly what we're looking for and with this of course being our entire code it is absolutely a voluminous thing to just say hey go out and review it all i think we as council if we want to keep this thing in any kind of uh a reasonable time frame and also a reasonable price because the city attorney is going to be involved with this review we need to kind of figure out what we're looking for i mean we know that we had certain areas for example like our sign ordinance that needs to be worked on but you know do we want to say to a committee just go ahead and look at everything or do we want to target certain things and if it comes down to like constitutionality and legality of laws we might be better served by and i'm going to suggest this i i've not spoken with him but it might just be a better review if our city attorney perhaps reviews it and comes back to us so i'm not so sure i i agree with this committee but i i don't know that this is the right time i think we may have to do a little bit of homework still to tell people what we're looking for that's what i wanted to say just to give you a little update uh and then and lynn glenn guns gonna be after you go ahead okay yeah just uh in the past what we've done is we've developed the charter after the committee has been established and we've had a meeting with them uh it wasn't typically established prior to but we would give them specific areas that we were wanting them to look at as an example we want to look at the seawall code we know that's one of the things we want them to look at i mentioned i think we need to look a little bit at our our purchasing policies our purchasing ordinances but that's those are minuscule things i'm not saying to change them dramatically i'm just saying and then you know some other areas that the council may want to do and you know we can give them that species [Laughter] so you know i think uh we can discuss that further at the work session if you you know the console that gives them an opportunity to say to us okay uh i think we ought to look at this part of the code because last time we looked i think if i remember right we looked at like five sections and we focused on those five and you know i i don't think it needs to be overwhelming i think it just needs to be on areas that the council feels that are that are important because you can't do it all at once that's a big book it's this thick so uh i think you you just have to pick and choose and then we'll do it again later too mark beam yeah i would like to say that the purpose of this group is to follow on on the great work done by the previous group okay this the the previous group was a all-encompassing review of the codes this one is going to be more of a surgical precision kind of thing okay the the what we're looking to do is plug some of the gaps identified since that last group plug some of the gaps from the unexpected consequences from the changes we made from the previous group uh we need to address newly identified problems and along with the strategic plan some things are starting to bubble to the top like infrastructure as well as the sea walls and i think it's also important to make sure that we have some resident participation because we're talking codes and we really we get a lot of mileage out of having buy in by the residents so i i really think this is something we need to even if necessary uh stall and advertise a little bit more get some more participation by the residents i will be happy to help the city manager uh build a charter for this thing i i helped do that on the first one so i can articulate some of these points and and help the city manager build that stuff that's where i am on yours well thank you for that offer i i i'd like you know that's what i was leading toward i i don't i just don't feel comfortable tonight putting this out we haven't even discussed it amongst council who has interest and who might want to be on this i have to make the appointment but i'm not going to stand in people's ways but i i by the same token i'd like to know really what we're driving for and i don't know i don't know it myself you know when i look at this as an attorney i say well i've got constitutionality issues i got a couple parts of this that i have a real problem with other people have issues that have you know come up and i think everybody has a little bit of an input so i hate to throw this to a work session but i i seem to think that we're going to have to hash this out and i think you do need that charter in this case because that will help us determine who are who's going to be the best people for this too i mean i don't again i don't know where the focus is so it's hard to say who's the best right now we have two people and i you know i do think we have to do a little more advertising um to have a little bit more uh interest and see where the interest lies on council if any okay so let me work with the city manager and help streamline this process and i i don't know if you want to table this thing or you make a motion i can i can i can bring it to everyone if somebody has to make a motion i'm sorry more more i'm sorry glenn marv had his hand up and then i'll come back to you if you want to make that motion okay go ahead mark oh the only thing i'd like to insert is we've got laura which is a great value she's out there doing the coach she may have a list of things that she's been out doing that might reflect on any changes we have made or ones that we need to make and the other thing is a code enforcement officer may may put a list together for us things that he's seen that he can't really do anything with because the codes are wrong now we may miss him so input from these two people along with lynn and i wish we could invite some of the other people that were on that committee before because they have the experience i wouldn't mind working with them but i think we need the community involvement 100 percent here because they're going to say well the council did this the council did that no it's not a good thing you need the community to kind of control the whole thing my view mark two excellent suggestions about can you turn that down please i'm sorry sorry i haven't though um i was speaking to somebody who's inside my office here uh the um i think it's two excellent suggestions to to bring our code individuals in i think you know the more information we can get the better um and i don't want to see us limited to i mean right now we don't have enough people but i i don't again i think last time we flexed the um communications committee and had extra people on it um if we have qualified people i'd like to see you know possibly even a greater group than five as possible um you know there's there's a lot of perspective on this and each person has brings their own special perspective on it um looking at different areas of the city so i i think a lot of people are going to make for a better code mr gunn did you advise me i'm sorry did you want to make a um a proposal sure i uh i would also say that this could be a segway or a recommendation from the committee on how best to to deal with this code enforcement issue the city manager has been struggling with how best to organize his step in dealing with this we we've outsourced to the deputy thing and there's some shortcomings with every way we've looked at this thing so we might be able to come up with some recommendations my proposal at this point is that we table this agenda item until the next council meeting to give me time to work with the city manager and build a draft charter for a code enforcement review follow-on committee i have anyone who would like to second that well a second mark beam seconds it i'm reaching for my thing help me out mr riley do i need uh is there debate on a table or not yeah you can debate it it should be able to click debate okay well it's it's open for council comment on and on the motion to table i support my only comment would be is we are going to continue to advertise for positions absolutely okay i tell you to put it on the sign outside but that's not going to work so anybody else we had it on the side but it was laying flat glen gunn i was just going to stretch to the council members that we all have our own network also and maybe put the word out uh to stress how important this is and the great results we got from the previous one so this is an important thing and resident participation has really looked unfavorably in this thing to glenn gunn's point i was actually looking at some of our procedures this morning we have the ability as individual council members to nominate people so ask them first but if they don't say yes you can still nominate them and get them up but you know maybe twist a few arms because i think you know you know he mentioned something that we could get some people maybe from you know that served in the past and stuff like that um i don't know if you know them reach out to them and see what we can do okay they're for those who know them so it's a possibility we don't have to reinvent the wheel and if we're tweaking this which is i think where we're at with this i think we're probably in consensus with that we don't need to um you know the the uh people who have the experience are gonna help so we've got a motion to table um any other comments on council i go to the city citizens this is just on the motion to table i have none no citizen come but no citizens that wish to comment back to glenn gunn for final comment if anyone else has any comments go first and then glenn has last comment okay so i'm going to call that question so before us now is the motion to table item 19 which is this resolution to establish this committee we're going to table at one council meeting into november glenn is going to work and uh on with the city manager and try and come up with a charter um you know we appreciate that assistance come up with the best you can with the charter i i think everybody's put their information in terms of the charter so i think he has a pretty good idea here of what we're looking for anybody else have anything to add to that question madam clerk would you please call so if you vote for this we will not be doing 19 and then item 20 is going to go away because we're not going to be appointing anyone tonight to a committee that hasn't been established council council member swope council member shirley aye council aki aye councilmember beam all right i think that was an eye council member gabriel broke it up hi vice mayor gunn all right mayor manzo all right so the motion uh table passes seven to zero so item 19 is tabled for one council session glenn gunn will proceed to work with the city manager um if he and not to give you any deadline or anything but if you have any information for the work session that's coming up mid month certainly feel free to bring it to our attention but not to put a deadline on you item 20 then um because we don't have a committee i don't believe we could appoint people to a committee that we don't have so i think item 20 goes away does every is that anyone everyone in consensus on that yes no one disagrees right okay so then we go item 21 the authorization to execute a revised agreement with the city attorney is the approval of a revised agreement with city attorney fred riley do i have a motion first time we need to smoke motions second second dave gaddis to read a slope okay actually my question is for uh city attorney fred riley now the revision here mainly the number three that we were all questioning to begin with that i just want to make sure i'm reading it and i'm very clear on the meaning of it that eliminates any city council member to contact you directly correct it just means we all have to advise you on what how we want you to move on something no each of these council members should be able to contact their attorney and occasionally their attorney your attorney may contact you but but as far as giving direction it needs to be consistent with the city code provision which is how i modify the agreement okay but i'm confused because that was one of the reasons why the attorney bills were so high was because you were being contacted so now we're opening it up to everybody can contact you i disagree any any attorney-client relationship the client who is the seven of you should be able to contact me if there's a reason for you to do that most of the time over the course of the last year there have been very few times that i've been contacted for the most part in the in the previous contract the the mayor contacted me um numerous times and that was authorized in the previous agreement mr riley i'm i'm with council member slope on this one i'm not sure who's supposed to contact you now i i thought that this would have to be through acclimation now of the city council which i was going to say is you know i know that's what we've discussed i find it to be terribly inefficient um but i you know it's it's now i'm hearing that we can contact you so i gotta say i'm confused too you'll make money you all make things very difficult the the contract as it's written is consistent with the code provision and it's consistent with the florida bar rule if one of the council members calls me a week from now assuming this is enacted and wants to ask me a question or raise a confidential or raise a confidential matter with me related to the city i think it's appropriate for them to be able to do that glenn gunn are we confusing the the ability to reach out and contact the city attorney versus a request for legal services in other words you see i i think that that's the confusion here nothing prevents anybody from picking up the phone and calling fred to ask a question or a concern but the only way that he he can be tasked with legal services and billable hours i mean step in here friend this is kind of what i'm thinking is the only persons who can the only people who can request legal services from you or the city manager or the council body itself i'll make two points one there are numerous things over the course of every month that i spend time on that are related to city business that i don't charge for it all and there's plenty of those you never even see on the bill so you know i i'm just telling you flat out that's the way things have been i've done them over the time that i've been here if a city council member calls me and asks or tells me something um then that should be acceptable if that city council member calls me and directs me to do something then i am going to say wait you don't have the authority to direct me to do something and that should be something that is discussed by the city council or you discuss it with the city manager and the city manager or the council should be the one directing me to take some action so that's the distinction great mr reilly and no one's asking you to and i know you've graciously um you know not billed us on many many a call um as a city and that's tremendous for you know tremendous that you've done that but certainly we're not asking you to do that but the minute somebody calls you if i want to make sure i'm straight with this technically the meter is running okay so somebody's incurring the minute someone has a question for you if they call you you have the right to build for that whether you choose to do so that's your solely your decision okay but i i don't i'm kind of torn because the minute you pick up the phone and someone anyone picks up the phone and called you they've now incurred legal services for the city costs mark you're next after fred riley answers well you know i i again any attorney i've been an attorney 34 years and it is imperative that the attorney be able to communicate with the client and if i if i receive a call then i will decide whether uh to charge for it or not and in the past that's what i've done and i'm just telling you flat out there's plenty of times i have not charged for it and i'm not talking two or three minutes there are plenty of times where it's been an hour that i've not charged for or over the course of a month uh several hours that i haven't charged for and there's there's several times and you know i i know everybody has is it has a professional level job on this council i mean there's times i do do things and the time i spend is substantially longer than what i bill you for because sometimes despite me trying to be efficient it is for whatever reason hard to find what you're looking for although you know it exists and that happens frequently too and i take that into account i frequently put in a note that the actual time i spent was you know 3.5 hours but i bill for two so that's that's another thing that i think if you looked at the bills you would have seen that quite a few times over the course of the last year plus i think marv did you did you want to go next i think did you have your hand up yes i did i think uh what we're trying to do here is establish a level of seriousness if it's serious enough that we bring him a question that should go to the city manager first he's going to take it upon himself to do that and then the city manager and him will discuss where it's going and we'll get an answer back we can't go any further or it's it's it has to go to a work session or something in that regard that's what i think we're trying to establish here and i think by doing this that's what it'll be that's what i understand robin hockey i agree with marv i think fred is gracious enough with his time and his common sense to direct us i think that this is probably not to direct fred in how he is dealing with the city it's almost as it's to direct us how we're dealing with the attorney as in he's not our uh referee he's not our oh yeah well let me go tell fred that this happened to see what he can do i mean he's not we're not going to mommy or daddy to tattletail and cause a problem or a punishment we need to maybe control ourselves and not use fred as an easy middle person and use common sense and use lynn and uh if it's something that needs to be discussed wait to a work session so i think fred is perfectly professional and gracious enough to monitor himself and i think that this looks fine to me jody shirley yeah i was i um kind of just the tail into that i think that you know normally when i have a question of concern my first call is belen i mean i don't i don't think i've ever had to reach out to fred reilly for anything where i would make that call first so generally my first call is to lynn but i don't want to take away the opportunity that if i can talk to fred riley that i need to be able to do that so um the last meeting when this came up fred asked us to give him an opportunity to rewrite the contract and i've read through it and i'm pretty satisfied with the way he's redrafted it i think it it clarifies it but doesn't restrict us and i think it's up to us to police ourselves and how much we call him and use the services um you know we're all adults and i think it's pretty clear that we just need to be cautious in spending tax payers dollars on legal fees thank you friend i think it's a good job thank you dave garris um i agree um i i think at the end of the day publicly posting fred's bill and showing particulars of who it is that's uh that's that's running up the bill is about all we can do at the end of the day uh it's the it's the taxpayer the citizen uh who has to make the decision uh as to whether the attorney is being abused or not um the purpose of this bill was or not this bill but this uh rewrite of the contract was basically to send a clear message that this council uh will not abuse uh the privilege of having uh direct contact with the city attorney and uh i think basically all we can do uh from what i'm what i'm hearing from from mr riley all we can do is uh is make a change and uh and hope for the best so uh i'm i'm for uh moving forward on this and uh let's see what happens anyone else on council mr riley i i wanted to respond to what mr council member gaddis just said um moving forward i i will you know look the seven of you in the eye except reed is not on camera and tells you if something comes up and i'm contacted depending on what it is and i i know what i have in mind but i uh to to maintain confidences i'm not going to say anything further but any lawyer that that is contacted i like them i need to be able to hear from my client and if they're the the look you in the eye part is if it's something that the council should direct me to do or the city manager will should direct me to to do one of those two things i will not take action and do much of anything until i get direction from one of those two bodies which is what it calls for in the charter so you know be forewarned that that's what will happen and i i don't have a uh unwillingness to say no i'm actually good at saying no but there needs to be a channel of communication so that the clients can contact me and again the thing i will do is stop if it's something that really should be a council decision you know there's a lot of things that really should be i mean in the time that i've done this that that is frequently one of the the things that you know it's hard for a an elected official to hear it but that's what the attorney should be telling them you can't direct me to do this or you shouldn't correct me to exist the council as a whole should direct you to do it or you should just discuss it with the city manager anyone else are there any citizen comments no oh wait a minute i do have one uh it looks like uh leslie is uh here hold on one second okay leslie if you would unmute please okay are we good now yes this is sort of a follow-on to what fred just spoke about hang on hang on leslie i know who you are but the record doesn't know who you are wesley doterra 2300 golf boulevard um this is sort of a follow-on to what fred talked about like who is his client at what point does attorney-client privilege kick in if an individual council member calls him is that individual council member his client or is the city his client and who speaks on behalf of the city as his client i think that's something that needs to be considered thank you thank you my answer to that is the collegial body which any other citizen comments well the host would like you to unmute your microphone you could press star 6 going back on what fred said yes if the council is your client if an individual council member calls you or contacts you does that count as the the council as your client or the city as your client just something to consider and that that's why i included the in the revised contract of the rule which is 4-1.13 i believe is a citation that that addresses that issue any other citizen comments before we close citizen comments i have none none come back to council with the last word going to read a smoke but any other council comments first i'll move to read a smoke i don't have any of the hosts i'd like you to unlock your microphone i will do that so this is an authorization to execute a revised agreement with the city attorney it's to approve the revised agreement which we have in our packet and it's been posted on the website for everyone else to see with city attorney fred reilly a yes vote will adopt that contract in place of his old contract effective today madam clark member aki hello i think she's muted the house would like you to unmute your microphone you can press star six to a newt eddie yes can you hear me she's a 595 number is she muted or did you know today uh i don't see a 595 number right at the top five nine 727 four six oh okay yeah yeah uh no she's just muted on her own no no i i can win can you hear me hi you muted yourself no i didn't i'm not muted here's my mu can you hear me yeah i can hear them turn it off okay now talk can you hear

okay madam clerk we had asked for the uh to call the uh what called the question here the authorization to execute a revised agreement with city attorney fred reilly it's item number 21 yes vote gives us that new agreement please call the roll council member aki aye council member beam aye councilmember gattis hi councilmember shirley aye councilmember swope hey vice mayor gunn all right mayor manzo okay so it passes five to two the contract is revised and mr riley um if you'll execute that we will get the proper signatures here at headquarters and that is effective immediately thank you okay we go to item 22 this is an authorization to award bid b 20-02 drainage improvements for harbor drive 7th and 8th streets this is to accept steve's excavating and pavement paving inc proposal 305 604.48 the funding is uh has been obtained from the fy 19 through 20 capital budget rollover do we have a motion first read a smoke mark beam read a smoke i'll defer to the city manager lynn reeves aaron console this is uh to award the bid for the drainage project on 7th and 8th street we'll be putting in a new outfall some new piping along harbor drive and replacing the inlets with the new graded inlets which will reduce some of the infiltration into the pipes that sometimes clog it and there will be some minor curb replacement and resurfacing on harbor uh seventh and eighth streets was resurfaced in probably the last six or seven years and uh so we're not going to resurface the whole street but we will do some curb replacement as needed so i'm asking for your approval then um two things one question is that i saw county people down there today it looked like they were bringing some heavy-duty equipment down there are they continuing with that project down at the end of the block with the is that still that uh that sewerage project they're doing something else the sewage project ceased in are finished in july so this is something else that they're doing with the pumps uh because as you and i both know the pump trucks were still there even even after they did this the project so they are aware of our project i've notified him of it and so our project probably won't start probably for by the time we get the contract signed and everything it'll probably be somewhere between three and four weeks so what they're doing they said they'll be finished in the next month lynn i'm not sure you have if you have this on 8th street we definitely have it on 7th the road was repaved just a few years ago and during hurricane irma the contractor came and unfortunately used the wrong equipment to remove debris and gouged up the front part of that road particularly as it goes by gulf boulevard it's actually a danger i mean if you're walking along the road and there are no sidewalks on it you can easily step in and twist your ankle i know i've talked with you a few times about doing it we've tried we were hoping that maybe it would come with the county when they dug things up over there is there any way we can get this thing fixed that that road's going to get destroyed those things are just going to keep opening up and we can fix it and save it now and probably save us a lot of money down the road with a very minor repair yeah i can i can ask we've got some contingency money in this contract so that's we've got some money we can adjust and you know the area i'm talking about right right right by the corner right yeah yeah it's just it's a small area but it's dangerous area okay yeah it's all that would take is milling and re-resurfacing great and i think you'll save the whole road if you do that and you won't you know the rest of the road is in great shape so i'm all for this obviously it's a we've talked about this for a while so anyone else uh any citizen comments i'm seeing none uh dave did you see any other he's shaking his head now so uh okay so we come back to the council and we'll end with rita slow no comments rita um i'm good call for the question will do authorization to awards item 22 authorization to awards b 20-02 drainage improvements for harbor drive 7th and 8th street this is the acceptance of steve's excavating and paving proposal 305 604 448 funding from the fy 19 through 20 capital budget rollover this isn't part of the proposal but lynn find some asphalt there and fix those uh those problems in the front of 7th street if you could okay that would be that would be great if we could work it in here a yes vote approves this madam clerk councilmember beam aye councilmember gaddis aye councilmember shirley aye councilmember swoe hi councilmember aki aye vice mayor gunn all right mayor manzo hi so it passes seven to zero lynn please proceed with that thank you mayor thank you item 23 authorized bid authorized award a bid b 20-0-1 beach walk-over restoration project this is to award the bid to eveland brothers inc one hundred eight thousand nine dollars funding in the fy 20 through 21 capital budget we have a motion a mark beam i think was first i think it was jody yeah okay mark uh glenn reeves aaron console this is uh to replace the beach walkovers at the beach accesses uh over the years they've uh what i would consider they've been they're buried in sand so we'll pull all that stuff out and replace it the good thing about this project is the county's sharing in the cost uh fifty thousand dollars and uh we've already uh the the fdep permitted stuff is already taken care of so uh just ask for you to approve us the award of this i think we've been talking about this for some time now lynn right this has been the work so now this is finally coming to fruition here correct right okay any council comments citizen comments back to council ending with marv glad to see it done thank you yeah i'll echo that thank you um okay so i'm going to call the question this is to authorize the bid of b20-01 beach walk-over restoration project we're going to award a bid to evelyn

councilmember aki aye councilmember beam hi vice mayor gunn hi mayor manzo all right so it passes seven to zero city manager you're authorized to award that bid to the evelyn brothers and move forward with that project thank you item 24 consideration of resolution 2020-16 a resolution of the city council of the city of bellaire beach florida to adopt a public records policy providing for incorporation of recitals providing for adoption of a public records policy providing for the repeal of all resolutions in conflict herewith and establishing an effective date this is the revision of use of city email by elected officials city staff employees boards and committee members and custodial costs um do we have a motion first jody shirley motions second second second dave gaddis jody shirley i think it's self-explanatory i think is it it's just recapping what we've discussed in the past any other council comments questions yes glenn i'm looking at paragraph 4.3 and i just want some clarification it talks about failure to comply with this policy shall place public records custodial responsibilities on it talked about it the same verbiage is used for elected officials and staff as well as board and committee members is it inferred that custodial responsibilities includes cost no it does not the florida statutes which is in chapter 119 about sets forth costs and the policy uh mirrors what's in the florida statutes in that the clarifications that i made to that section were to make it clear that which is consistent with florida law that whoever is the custodian of the record is the one that is responsible for them and it's a very simple uh solution if somebody's going to not use their the a city issue email address which the court would have access to if it's an email address on a private server and the uh individual does not copy the clerk then they are the sole custodian of the record and their obligation under florida law is to provide a public record that is requested i understand that portion of it my question and it's it kind of uh underscores what we're trying to accomplish here is plugging the whole or who bears the cost of those custodial responsibilities in other words if that person chooses to use his own email uh keep the record however he wants but he's called upon to retrieve that record who bears the cost is that a reimbursable expense or does the person who who has those custodial responsibilities do they bear the cost themselves well the the obligation is on the person that is the custodian of the records and i'll go down two different tracks one track is they copy the city cloak in that situation the city clerk is it has custody of the records and they uh the city clerk can provide them to whoever requests them the other one is the the individual uses a private server and does not copy the city clerk under florida law and this policy they have the obligation as the custodian of the record to provide the record in that situation if they refuse to provide the record then the thing that that would be done is either the city clerk or i would uh continually ask that they comply with florida law and provide the record if they step fastly refuse to do so and it ended up going to court what i would do in a courtroom is show the judge the evidence that shows what efforts i made and what efforts the city clerk made to get the records on behalf of the city and that would in inevitably lead or include the person that has is the custody of the records they would have to answer for themselves in if they uh refuse to provide the records and i don't know how i can do it any other way the the thing that is important is in order to charge fees of any sort or costs of any sort you have to have a basis in the statute to do that i'm not i guess i'm confused because i'm not sure i got an answer out of that i understand who's responsible for producing a record and i understand what what uh avenues you have for getting that record my question is if the individual produces the record and says oh by the way it cost me this to find the record reproduce it and give you a copy of it is that a reimbursable expense or does the person who has the custodial responsibilities responsible for bearing the cost for retrieving that record and providing it to the person who's requesting the public record okay fred i'm going to have to step in and um you are discussing a threatened litigation right now there is a lawsuit he cannot give you that answer he cannot answer your presiding officer i am asking a question to our city attorney hope you're not already that's number one number two mr riley i will permit you to ask this but i will remind you that we received a notice of lawsuit on this exact issue if you wish to opine be my guest city attorney my question goes to paragraph 4.3 of this agenda item the question is if the verbiage talks about custodial responsibilities and my initial question was does custodial responsibilities infer that the person with the custodial responsibilities bears the cost or do you need specific language in that guideline to differentiate between who has the responsibility and who bears the cost well i'm going to answer the question but i'm going to answer the question uh making a couple points the first one is you you're asking me a hypothetical which is fine um you you did not ask me a question about a specific case okay i'm making that progress correct okay um the the answer that i'm going to give is a generic answer the court the reasonable cost if there are reasonable costs incurred then the reasonable cost should be charged that's consistent with florida law and there's a whole section that addresses what are the reasonable cause so so that's my answer dave gaddis's hand is up uh uh my question is is to whom is responsible for those costs that's the part that's not clearly defined is it the city's responsibility to pay the person that that had to dig up the records or is it the person's responsibility to charge the requester directly because that's where the confusion is and and i think it probably needs to be included in this document well again i'm going to say the same answer it's the reasonable costs that are authorized in the statute can be charged regardless of who the custodian is whether it's a city clerk or somebody else whatever the reasonable cost statutory reasonable thought should be is what is being addressed mr riley i have a question i have two questions for you actually it's a three-part question have you reviewed this four point three four yeah you wrote it okay good so you wrote it um and i assume well i'm not gonna assume i'm gonna have you tell me uh it's compliant with the federal constitution i would say it is and the state constitution i would say it is and all federal and state statutes i would say it is okay i respectfully disagree and i'm gonna leave it at that um i don't believe you can make these this obligation on an elected official uh so we can professionally disagree um i i don't think you can constitutionally impose any requirement and the problem the word i have a problem with as a lawyer is shall you could say should you could say it's suggested and you can and you can do that with what's the point of order um you're talking as an attorney rather than the mayor of the city no i'm speaking with my expertise ms smoke just like you are a realtor and i will use my expertise just like you use your realtor expertise so yes i am an attorney i am speaking now as an individual as a mayor who happens to hold oh a nice pretty law license and admission to three courts well actually more than that but three states so mr riley i'm sorry so that's not that point is not well founded at what point of order so my question is is i i know for a fact that you can impose these restrictions on employees but i don't believe you can do it on an elected official any other comments or questions dave gaddis i'd like to call the question uh you can't call the question before the count before these citizens have had an opportunity to speak but you can call it after that there are no citizens with their hands right well i'll ask for that after we finish with council comments are there any other council comments and now i just saw now we'll move uh sorry jody shirley we have one now yeah hang on we're still in council comments and it's jody shirley has the floor no i was just saying there's a citizen that raised their hand i noticed that all right is there any other council comments before we go to city report citizens now we go to citizens i have kim kim please identify yourself good evening my name is kim shaw elliott i live on 121 9th street here in bel valera beach the proposal for the policy seems to be very reasonable and consistent with common practices in that the city is making available to all city officials a secure system for communication of city business and if an individual elects not to use that communication system essentially this rule is saying you're on your own if you choose not to use the one that's provided then that individual is considered the custodian of the record and would have the obligation to produce those records and certainly at their own expense as i read this so i think it's a very fair and reasonable approach the security of communications is becoming a significant issue of late and is a significant risk for many organizations and so this seems to be a reasonable approach thank you um we're on citizen comments any other citizens there are none then we'll come back to council i saw glenn gunn's hand up glenn wait wait wait i'm sorry i'm sorry wait wait wait we got it we got a late citizen comment we're gonna go back to citizens all right i have peggy peggy please identify yourself and you have three minutes peggy atlas two two two eight donato god and i agree with kim i'm sorry but in this day and age we should be used if there's a city official they should be using city emails i mean with what we've just seen in the last couple of years in the united states government with people accidentally wiping their phones accidentally wiping their hard drives you know there's a lot at stake here so i think it's a perfectly reasonable request okay thank you any other anyone else citizens i'm going to close citizen comments if i see no other hands no dave none okay we'll move to glenn gunn who's back to council yeah i agree with kim and peggy on this but that what i'm hearing from fred wiley is not what i think they're hearing and that is yes they they have custodial responsibilities but from what i'm hearing from fred reilly it's not necessarily at their own expense if they they submit a reasonable cost to the city they can build the city for retrieving those public records is that what i'm hearing i mean that's that's the crux of what my line of question is about i yes they have custodial responsibility but what i'm hearing from fred riley is that that individual with the custodial responsibility if the reasonable if the costs are reasonable they can be reimbursed or submit a bill to the city mr riley you want to answer that i'll answer it in the in very much the same manner i did before there's a statute that addresses the costs and the statute regardless of who the custodian of the record is it is the the cost the reasonable cost of producing the records can be charged to the person requesting the records that's what the florida law says so whether it's the city clerk or another individual who has the custody of the public records if there is a statutory basis for them to charge for those records then they are authorized to do it so the person who requests the record makes the public records request for the city who's on the hook for for the bill well i'm going to use the the um most extreme example i can come up with if a citizen wrote an email to the city clerk and said i'd like all the records for the seven council members for the last five years all their emails the first thing that patty would do in responding under this policy would be to give them some projection as to what the cost would be for those records and i'm just going to pick a number that that amounts to 30 000 emails and patty would figure out the you know make a cost projection on what it would take to go through and review and redact 30 000 emails and then when stat projection is made it's provided to the person that has requested the emails and that that is authorized under florida law and if the person then decides that they want the 30 000 emails then they can provide a deposit and the records would be produced and before their the records are released to them then they would have to pay for whatever the remainder of the costs were that's what the statute allows so it doesn't matter whether it's the city corp or another individual that that's a good example any other council comments before i end with mark glad mark beam and jody jody your last so more smart snacks go ahead mark it's hard to ask and if i'm wrong shut me down all right you've got one person asks another person to ask another person to get the emails is it the original requester that pays the bill well under florida law the person that requests the records uh doesn't even have to be identified so somehow the person requests records and then under florida law the city clerk and anybody else who's a custodian the records is if it's a city or if it's a public record they're obligated to provide it to the citizen so the the chain of chain of direction i i'm not going to comment on that at all it doesn't it's irrelevant if someone asks for a public record and indeed the document is a public record then under florida law you're obligated to provide the public record to them that that's the heart and soul of chapter 119 but if the requester is a third person down the chain irrelevant is that the person that has to pay the person that requests the records whoever that may be okay you got i've got my answer thank you yes sir i think you're you're missing the point there is because a public records request comes into the city the city clerk makes the request to the staff member or the public official ergo so who's making the the public records request the clerk or the individual so who's on the look for reimbursement and paying the bill for reasonable expenses the person that requested the the uh record and that person's anonymous whether it's a city the city court is a custodian or anybody else it doesn't make any difference the person that requests the record if there are costs that that statute provides for them to pay then they're obligated to pay it before they get the record okay so can i can i say i think the the uh we're going down this um bunny trail where the purpose of this 4.3 is to ensure that we all use our city emails and if we choose not to that we copy the clerk and it's no longer our responsibility except maybe to go through the emails and potentially redact things that might necessarily need to be redacted but other than that it's not our responsibility so it's not going to be time consuming for any of the council members or the staff to go through their emails because we followed the procedure that fred drew up here and this who gets reimbursed and so forth and who and who pays the bill is handled if this guideline is followed so i this is the process in trying to get us cleaned up so that that's no longer an issue you disagree one way i'm not gonna have all the cross talking hang on hang on mark beam's hand is up and then we'll go back to glenn for his third time on this go around go ahead mark the only thing i i can see here is we've we've actually seen by discussion who needs to pay who it's clarified whether it's in the past or the future whether we're wrong or we're right whether we control the emails or not we've just discovered who ever asked for the emails and whoever has to give the answer needs to be paid by the person requesting bottom line well the suppose go ahead i didn't want to i'm sorry it didn't mean let me just i just want to acknowledge robin for we have i have fred reilly then glenn gunn then robin hockey okay well i'll just respond to mark's point um if you enact and approve this policy this policy only perspective it's going forward it does not deal with anything that has happened prior to now so that's one to me very important clarification glenn gunn yeah so so yeah we understand this is the future we're trying to plug gaps here so the hypothetical glenn gunn at a future date chooses not to use his city email address and i use a private email address okay so i use my private email address for city business an anonymous public records request comes into the city clerk saying i want to see glenn gunn's public records regarding city business for the last month or so this policy says i'm responsible for the i have those custodial responsibilities for those private those emails that i keep on my private email address so i go ahead and retrieve those records to make them available for the public records request my question is if i bill for my reasonable cost for retrieving those records who do i build do i bill a city clerk who contacted me saying there's a request for your public record or do i build some anonymous email address requested by public records if you don't build this you you provide the city clerk with the costs that you incurred that i am hopeful or consistent with the florida statute and their reasonable costs and assuming their reasonable costs and they're consistent with the florida statute then the clerk would uh advise the person that made the request that they're obligated to pay him okay i'm on board now it took us 30 minutes to get there but i understand third time was a charm robin robin you're muted you have to unmute yourself i don't understand what's so difficult i caught on right away i mean the person requesting they're anonymous let's face it nothing's anonymous these days they send it from an email address they can get an email back they want it they pay a deposit they want all of them they pay the rest of it done i don't understand he wrote it very well i'm happy with it let's call the question if it's the appropriate time i don't know when but let's move on i'm going to go back through jody shirley because it's her motion jody at the last word but i'm going to reiterate this is um i believe unconstitutional you cannot force an elected official to you cannot tell someone who they must copy emails on you're going down that 1983 road again folks don't go there that's my vote i respectfully disagree with you okay i can't i'm gonna say i this is one of these times i i went over this again and again to try and find a way to make it consistent with the florida statue and i i will be the first to admit this like a lot of things is not perfect but florida statutes aren't perfect either there's there's some holes in it um in chapter 119 and i'm aware of that the people that i talk to that are uh far more expert in this field of law than i am agree that there's holes in it this is the best i can do to make it consistent with the florida statutes we'll we'll respectfully disagree you can't mandate someone's communications mr riley that's my position we'll finish up with jody shirley unless anyone else has anything expectedly disagree with you i think i'll just uh recap in that as long as you follow the procedure and copy the clerk you'll never get to get stuck in that position of how to how to who gets who gets reimbursed and when and why and all those those uh questions that came up so i would say big dave's got his hand up again if we're gonna have another round that's fine i'll keep going jody gets the last word so go ahead dave if you want to speak afterwards jody are you finished yes go ahead okay dave go ahead we'll go around again i'd like to call the question no no i was going to call the question jody had the last word and if you want to call the question we have to do a vote on it so she had the last word okay i will call this question consideration is item 24 consideration of item 2020-16 a resolution of the city council of the city of bel air beach florida to adopt a public records policy providing for incorporation of recitals providing for adoption of a public records policy providing for the repeal of all resolutions in conflict here with and establishing an effective date revision then the description is revision of the use of city email by elected officials city staff and employees boards and committee members and custodial costs a yes vote will pass that policy uh as amended and as red well it's not red line it's underlined in 4.3 madam clerk council member shirley aye council member swope hi councilmember aki aye councilmember beam aye council member gavis so it passes six to one this is now policy we'll revise it and we'll get it into the policy books moving on to item 25 consideration of resolution 2020-15 a resolution of the city council of the city of delaware beach florida calling for a general election to be held on march 9 2021 for the purpose of electing three city council members for three three-year terms to establish the qualifying day person seeking elective office for the 2021 municipal election and establishing an effective date this is to set election qualifying period that's the description so first emotion so late i think we had a tie there i'm gonna go with jody shirley rita swope jody we'll go to you first you know it's just procedure we've got an upcoming election and three of us council members are up for being replaced or what have you so i would say uh that's it anyone else any citizen comments there are none coming back to council and we will end with jody shirley jody any last words no nothing further okay thank you uh we'll call the question it is item 25 consideration of resolution 2020-15 a resolution of the city council of the city of bel air beach florida calling for a general election to be held on march 9th 2021 for the purpose of electing three three city council members for three three-year terms to establish the qualifying date per person seeking elective office for the 2021 municipal election and establishing an effective date we will set the election qualification period a yes vote passes that resolution madam clerk council member swo hi councilmember aki aye council member beam aye council member gaddis hi councilmember shirley hi vice mayor gun mayor manzo all right so 1007 to zero um i i guess this goes to our city clerk for uh for um processing now since she's i believe our elected official or our election um official is that correct madam clerk yes okay so we'll give that over to you okay we're finished um with the uh regular agenda and now we move on to the regular business what we have left is the unfinished business item number 26 is there any unfinished business hearing none we'll move on to the city attorney's report i have no report this evening um mr riley i have one question for you i'm not going to ask you with the person but um i brought this person up i sent you something this week just an email that i received from the city we have an individual in the city i referenced this person in the last council meeting calling up city hall making defamatory not defamatory remarks on ethnic slurs and it's continuing and now it's escalated to the point is why i sent it to mr riley that she's now hired not one but supposedly two attorneys so i wanted to alert the council to this individual she claims that people are breaking into her backyard i don't know if it's i don't know one minute she talks about the police one minute she talks about our city people and then she's talking about the italian people so i don't know what's going on here but mr riley because litigation was threatened i wanted to give it to you and see what our next step should be these are getting more and more i don't say hate speech filled um so i haven't reported it yet to the sheriff but it's getting there so i'll defer to you and your wisdom on this um i don't know how much wisdom i had i listened to the recordings that you forwarded to me in something i intended to talk to to lynn about the person in one of the recordings references their attorney i i can easily uh call their attorney and ask the attorney what's the problem with your uh client that's fine i'm happy to do that um i would hope that would be an exceptionally short call but you know half of the stuff she was talking about i i was unclear what she was even referring to mayor and console we we've referred her to the sheriff's office already because she calls she'll call patty she calls laura she calls me she emails me she email calls the mayor she wants to call everybody it's just a situation the sheriff has been over there and they've referred her to the mental health unit and they're they're going to hopefully deal with it eventually but lynn are you saying that basically i mean i don't you know again as a consensus as a council consensus do we want to have mr uh i mean she did she did make threats about lawsuits and stuff but she wasn't specific do we want to just let this pass at this point and leave it in you know we'll send him anything else we get yeah i i think at this point this is recurring it you know it goes in uh cycles it'll happen for a couple months then she'll go away i mean she used to complain about a deputy we had here so it's just just the person in the situation jody i think i saw your hand up yeah i was gonna say i think that it's clear that there's some mental health issues don't know if there's family nearby maybe a call from fred to her attorney if we if this gentleman is actually her attorney just to say you know there's ongoing harassment is it possible that there's family members you can get involved you know i you know i don't know who i don't know who can figure that out but it would make sense if an attorney has maybe some some contact with her family that might be a good solution to get someone else involved by robin's hand and fred go ahead after so robin first from a medical standpoint my only concern is is she a harm to herself is she a harm to individuals does she have any suicidal or homicidal ideations that's something i think the sheriff needs to look into for a public safety perspective i don't want you to just you know push it away like oh she does this in cycles it's just part of the process that's how these things start so i'm just thinking you know safety yeah the sheriff is totally aware of it and they they may make contact unfortunately she doesn't when they do make contact she won't come out of her house and they it hasn't got to the point that robin's speaking about welfare and stuff so but they are totally aware of it and it's been an ongoing situation off and on for several years i have fred next and then mark b well i i just was going to say that you know i wanted to talk to lynn about the background of it but now i'm hearing what the background is the best thing for me to do is to not call the attorney i will send him an email so that i copy lynn and patty on it and ask if there's an issue that we need to progress on behalf of the city of bel air beach and see what the guy responds with and that way you have a paper trail showing that we've done the most responsible thing that could be done that's good mark that's what i was going to say it's an ongoing thing it's been at least five years that i know of and fred you're on the right path i mean just a paper trail that we've done what we can do to resolve the issue in a in a decent manner and call it a day but to robin's point and i think it's a valid one you know these things can turn sometimes very very quickly and it has been you know ongoing apparently i thought i was the only one getting the phone calls but it looks like everyone at city hall is getting those phone calls and they're pretty nasty so um you know not really getting to the point of threats yet but uh you know i could see it getting that way so yeah let's keep an eye on this thing and we'll just keep communicating so i think we're all in agreement that fred's um idea is the way to go yes yes i think so okay fred anybody else had anything for the city attorney we move on to the city manager yeah quickly uh the the work session uh on the third monday the items i have on there right now discussion of the marina fees fred's going to make a presentation about the sign ordinance striping of the city streets that was requested by council member beam the communications committee to review that report and look at how we're going to move forward with the survey that they recommended the additional policing and uh the turn lane on gulf boulevard if we get some information back from uh wit in his group in your packet you got the code enforcement report don't forget that the sheriffs don't deliver anything anymore uh effective october 1st uh they're the mailbox i don't know how many of you have tried it out but it's it's here at city hall and we'll put all your mail in it and next week i am going to be on vacation and kyle will be in charge enjoy lynn um i don't know if this is appropriate but we're putting stuff in that box for you like the you know the extra bags and the binders and things that are being decided paddy's picking those out okay good so that's what we'll continue to do then yeah did you have anything else flynn nope that's it i have two questions for you um one is we have a garage sale but our city's our citizen our council didn't authorize the garage sale or a citywide yard sale so um i wasn't sure we were going back to events again so i'm not against it but i just want to make sure that again we're doing everything according to the rules here so i don't believe we ever authorized to go back to these activities well this is the standard annual garage sale and and i've never brought that to city council and and i don't think anyone has uh over the years it's we do one in the fall we do one in the spring and we all we've decided as a group to alternate the parking are we going to go back to doing these city events now if we're if we're opening this up are we going to be opening up city events that'll really be up to the park board if they want to do anything at this point i you know the garage sales those are a lot of individuals have asked about it and it's an annual garage sale that's been done for years well we're in the middle of a pandemic so council um where it's not a formal motion but i want consensus from us that that's what we want to do as a city and if we don't want to do this as a city then this needs to be put on hold until we can get it to a work session because we're in a different time than we were last year so um where we at council robin's shaking our head i'm not in favor of it either so i mean clearly this is not a big a large gathering at city hall it's not city sponsored so i think it's a little different um you know if i want to have a yard sale i think i should be able to have a yard sale and i don't think it's up to the city to give me that service i would be and it's already been it's already out there so i think the date is set and it's coming up here in the next couple weeks isn't it next week november 7th november 7th okay but uh so i would you know i think you just let it go i don't think it should be i don't think we should change it at this point dave gaddis and mark beam yeah i don't i don't see this as something that the city is sponsoring uh yes we do set aside a day for it however i look at it as private citizens dealing with private citizens and what they do in the privacy of their own homes is their business mark b well i'll agree with that um private privatism private that but on the overall view i think as a city we should take the responsibility and not authorize it this year or at least until next year well they can still do their private garage sale they can do it individually you know it's it's it's a possibility of passing something on from outside the city to a resident i don't think it's worth it i think it's too risky you know i'd like to speak as well robin's hang on i have uh let by marv then um we go robin and well robin you spoke first so i'm gonna go back to rita and then to you okay so read it first and then robin aki so is mark i'm sorry mark were you finished yes i'm done okay i'm sorry okay go ahead rita i'm going to agree with councilmember shirley and councilmember gaddis um this is a private thing um it's not a city-sponsored event by any means so i agree with both of them robin hockey no i agree it's private it's not a city-sponsored event but because it's advertised more people show up as opposed to i decide this saturday to randomly have a garage sale and put out a sign i may only get 20 people but because this is a larger many more garage sales around the area attracts more people so i may have 50 to 100 people at my house so there's just more chances of spreading who knows people think hey it's outside i don't need a mask and well we all know that that's not how this works with the virus so i i say no i understand it's private you can still have your own private one any saturday or sunday you choose but i don't think we should encourage large larger crowds than normal that's it i'm gonna i'm gonna have to chime in here and say that with the um it is city sponsored okay the city organizes this the city places signs around the city polices it the city um goes out afterwards picks those signs up so um we advertise it so i do believe that we um we are sponsored in the extent of sponsoring it we're sponsoring it we're promoting it and we're helping organize it so um i guess you know i'd like to hear from fred reilly i i see you back there fred um legally i mean you know i i know people consume for anything but you know we're talking about thinking about hosting a garage sale what are we looking at over here okay i'm unmuted correct go ahead yes now we can hear you go ahead well if if the city has an organizational role in it then conceivably somebody could make a claim and it's you know i i'm not going to tell you that won't happen um it's it's one of these things you simply have to weigh the pros and cons and make the most sound decision you can i mean i i i i'm extremely torn on stuff like this because you the the easy answers don't have it and cancel it and you you know if you do it that way there will be no liability because without an event there is no liability but on the other side of the coin um you know the whole country and state are trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy and having a yard sale is is doing that type of thing and it's it's three weeks ago or three weeks from now so or a month from now so what what kind of shape we'll be in a month from now is anybody's guess i mean over the course of the especially the last four months it has been an absolute roller coaster so i i don't have a very good um you know there's no no real basis in law to tell you much of anything other than if you have the event there's the prospect of some liability if the city has a organizational role in it that's the best observation i can make a gun are there any state restrictions or county restrictions right now or no no actually miller bluffs is having the garage sale the same weekend we always have it okay so let me extrapolate from there and let's put the emphasis back on a little personal responsibility here if you're concerned about strangers stepping on your property then you don't have a garage sale if if if you're concerned about mingling with other people then you don't go to a garage sale the flip side of this this legal issue is people are starting to sue for governmental overreach that's the flip side of this coin here there's no reason why we have to put up a roadblock or something like this it would certainly behoove us to be responsible and perhaps any involvement we have we can have a waiver or a warning or restriction hey you know be smart about this if you're going to attend or do something like that social distancing personal hygiene et cetera et cetera but that that's just kind of my opinion on this whole thing thank you i would say full resolution together that states that the presidents are on their own as far as any health issues related to the pandemic if you have a garage sale you're totally responsible it takes the city out of it well i have a sleeve let's just drop the garage sale the people that have signed up will tell them they can have their garage sale because they can and anybody that wants to have one on that day they can have it we just won't be involved in it and you know our involvement mainly is trying to help control the parking on the street well no no not if we're not going to be involved in it i don't you know i think we either don't get involved in it and just let the people that want to have them that have signed up there's very few that want to have a garage sale let them do it within the city's ordinance and they have been doing that i'd like to speak okay i'm going to agree with the city manager lynn reeves that we just bail as far as the city involvement because just as mayor manzo said earlier you know it is getting to be so happy i'm paraphrasing your comment but so we need to go ahead and just pull the city out of it and let everybody deal with their own and it's probably going to be the same thing with halloween people are going to have to deal with it whether they want to open their door to little kids or not but i think we just pull the city out let people that already signed up have it on their own that salsa okay well let's let's let's get a consensus here so so basically the city manager at this point is saying um we're just we're just not going to formally be behind it people can certainly participate on their own we're not telling you to do it or not do it we're just not involved are we all in agreement with that does anybody disagree everybody's thumbs up my thumbs up rita i'm good okay everybody's good so lynn we're kind of half uh in it yeah um but we're not eating it officially okay so to that next question um i think glenn gunn actually just brought up the thing that i was gonna ask you the last thing that i have for you um in michigan there was actually just a supreme court ruling that said the governor can't have this unlimited state of emergency we've had a state of emergency since march thank god it doesn't look like you've had to use a lot of those emergency powers and i mean the purpose of us doing this in the beginning was as our stated purpose was because we really didn't know that you know the health and welfare issues of covet 19 they haven't gotten any better okay but i think when i look at the fact that we've had 26 um people in our entire city that have been affected by this the pandemic in terms of you know overrunning our city getting to the point where you need to involve emergency powers and stuff like that really hasn't come to pass so i wanted to add this is what i wanted to put by the way on the agenda and there was a little mix-up between patty and i didn't get on there so um i went on to ask you i have to consult with you but i i don't the way i'm looking at it i don't know that we need to keep this going in our city it could be reinstituted in five minutes time if you ever needed it so well i i until the county and the state reduce it i would leave it alone we haven't we haven't had to do anything but buy a few supplies and you've approved us going forward with that law enforcement grant and i i think for now it's it's it gives us if something happened it it gives us an immediate opportunity but we haven't used it but i would leave it alone until the county revokes theirs let me defer to you on this one if you're familiar with that case again they're they're at the court and this is the first one and it may not be presidential it's certainly not presidential for florida but it's it it's you know and there's no challenge in florida but i could see it coming um you know these ongoing states of emergency and you know there's i think we have consensus that we really think again thank god we haven't really had to use those emergency powers but do we keep this in is legally should we keep this in place because this could go on for another six months and state of emergency is a very high state of alert it's the highest state of alert we could have in our city so i'm familiar with the the case in michigan and i think that you know forgive me for using the word extreme but i think the governor was extreme in many respects and and that's what got the governor of michigan into trouble having said that i i would tend to agree with lynn the the way that i always conceptually looked at this when the city was was considering it is what is the state doing first and foremost and what is the county doing and do you really want to be out in front of the the pack or do you want to remain with the pack and be and especially be consistent you know with both the county and the state that's where i think you still are and i think it's an issue that you should revisit in the not so distant future and to me the appropriate thing would be don't do it change anything but agree tonight that this will be brought up a month from now because like i said a minute ago the last four months have just seemed like such a roller coaster up and down and at times it's changing on a week to week basis where you think you're almost through it and then you're back to the situation we're facing today where it seems like it's just running rampant but that that would be my suggestion okay i'm good with that i'm the person who would release it so i i'm gonna i'm good with that explanation we'll revisit this in november one one other comment that one thing about bel air beach that is a unique feature is you don't have retail and commercial and if you had retail and commercial i think it would be a whole different calculation but you know because it's all residential you you're you're simply going to to maintain the status quo which we hope changes soon back to let's get back to normal life okay we'll revisit this in november at the november meeting again and see and then you know obviously i don't think anything's going to change that rapidly in terms of them finding a cure or something okay um anything else for the city manager one last thing the the our meeting in november the first monday the next day is election so you're probably going to get a very light agenda so maybe you could celebrate well thanks after what you did to us tonight because the election people have to come in and we really need to and as it stands now it's going to be an in-person meeting so yes i i sent something to patty gentry uh the florida league of cities basically elaborated on the governor's thing and said basically they gave us this month to get our transition ready and we'll be transitioning it looks like next month so right so okay okay city clerk no nothing i have one question for you patty um i think i heard the answer tonight but i just wanted to i wanted the explanation of what happened with the beginning of the meeting last month it was pretty much just what uh the vice mayor said you know there was a and you had said you know there was a last minute phone call then we had to scramble to make a last-minute phone call to the vice mayor to get him on board and then um trying to get everything set up with the meeting and it just ran into the actual start of the meeting so the recording just wasn't set till later correct okay anybody else any questions for the city clerk city coun we go to city council comments um october's an even month so we start alphabetically with robin hockey i'm good nothing mark b no nothing tonight thank you they've got it they're safe and healthy thank everyone all the attendees who actually make the end very cool it's nice to see uh quite a few people we've got 16 right now uh well not include sorry 15. uh also uh i think it's a uh uh it was a great meeting for us tonight uh we we got managed to accomplish a lot and uh everyone stayed pretty civil so very cool um other than that patty i would like to get with you uh sometime this week and find out what's going on with your computer and see if we can make the uh the start of these meetings a little smoother we seem to be having rough starts uh on each one of them and maybe we just need to practice or maybe something's truly wrong with your computer no it's not either oh i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you um no it's not the computer it my computer is fine when we're using the ear pods it went really smooth everything went fine but they only last for three and a half hours so and then they would die and so then um you know we got a uh plug-in headset and that's when trying to get uh the plug-in set up differently than the earpods is uh it's what's throwing it off i had it going and then it lost the picture and then we lost the sound but so it was going so i would appreciate it that'd be great dave i really appreciate that yeah okay and that's all i have and dave i just wanted to thank you i know you you know this has not been easy with setting up all these crazy remote systems and everything else and you put a lot of effort into doing it and my thanks from the city for all your efforts on that oh you're welcome thanks jody shirley you're next so i don't want to open a can of worms or bring up a topic but i mentioned this to lynn and um i just want to make sure that lynn you get an opportunity to talk to thread about it and that is regarding condos and their short-term rentals and how they're able to continue to operate when we have a code in place against short-term rentals so we need to deal with that um so if you and fred will review that then we can make well i'd like to say we can discuss it at the work session but i'm not going to be uh at the october 19th work session i'll be out of town so just giving you a heads up on that too um jody you can zoom in on that if you want that's still going to be virtual as long as i have internet access okay so um yeah that might be a little difficult but we'll see but that's it thank you all great meetings thank you rita swope uh yes actually i want to direct something to city manager lynn reeves can you put on the work session for us to have a discussion about some type of recognition for the purcells and in their you know respect in the blue i'd like to see something happen there as well as many other people have asked me about it other than that i'm good i don't have anything else will do glenn gunn big meeting and kudos to dave gaddis for being adaptable and keeping this thing going on the fly good job thank you very much hey thank you um i i have a few items um first i i attended the last big actually most of this comes from that it all comes from the big c um first jodi is going to break your heart but you lost the vote for forward pinellas eight to one i voted for you on behalf of bel air beach and there was one abstention so um unfortunately we didn't win that one but um so cookie kennedy will be representing the big c on that one um regarding short-term rentals uh mary beth henderson i believe from in from reddington shores i think it is they have done apparently extensive work and they they have the same situation that we do with a grandfather um short-term rental bill but they addressed all of these uh like party houses and stuff which i don't think is a big problem in our city but she was nice enough and she said her attorneys did a tremendous amount of work on this she was nice enough to share with us that um that the results that that uh the um resolution that they came up with so i'm going to jodi hopefully you can make it i'm going to put this on the another thing when for our work session but i'm going to put this on i'm going to get a copy of that over to the city clerk so you all can get it and then we i haven't really delved into it but we can discuss it it might be something we want to use to supplement our code obviously fred reilly is going to have to get make the final decision on this because i was always told never to mess with the short-term rental ordinance um but they were able to do it and they didn't mess with their short-term rental ordinance in fact they were even talking about places like indian rocks using it where i guess they had messed with it and lost their grandfathering so apparently it's a really good ordinance i'm going to send it over to everybody we can discuss and see if we have any interest in it i think to jody shirley's point yes i think that bears consideration it's amazing that one segment of our city can rent short term and then another can and when i look at these crime reports because i i request um everyone can request this you can get on the sheriff's list of crimes in the area um most of these crimes most of this domestic violence most of the stuff we're seeing it's happening in those in those condos and those rental areas so um it's it's bringing in some issues i think to our city that we may want to consider so uh a good point on that and i thank everybody for a meeting there's a couple tough spots but i think we've worked our way through it and i think it went well last topic and i thought i would bring this up to the council beller beach is i swear to spoke to lin and patty about this i got a decision today from the mayor serrano who's the chairman of the big city we're supposed to host next month i'm not exactly sure the date in october it's probably around the 21st or something like that 20 it's something like that but we're supposed to host that here in bellar beach they thought that it was going to be an in-person meeting turns out now that you know we can do virtual the issue really comes down to he threw it to me and he said you made the decision and i said well i'll bring it to the council tonight and most importantly lynn and patty because you're the ones who really have to put this thing together the issue is this we typically run about 30 to 40 to even 50 people at those meetings okay you have to provide a breakfast they've said that if we provide breakfast they don't want a buffet they want it to be hand-held stuff that can go fast you're gonna have to do social distancing but we are still as a council meeting virtually so um you know i i guess i go i i i'm not going to ask fred how he's got i'm going to ask you fred you certainly have the opportunity to speak but i know fred reilly is going to say if you have a safer alternative take it okay and the safer alternative is to do this virtually and not just not put ourselves into this thing um you know somebody comes here and has a problem then it's going to be our problem i also think that it's going to exhaust our manpower because you know where we normally would just have to have a setup and stuff i think we're now going to have to be directing people and making sure they don't pile up at the check-in lines and stuff like that so i don't think anybody would be too hurt if we said no but i want to open it up to the council and to our city management mayor i would say leave it virtual we're very were staying virtual till november first so i would leave it virtual i agree mark b same thing leave it virtual virtual no bacon and eggs though marv if you do that i know i'm listening i'm losing weight over there he wasn't gonna get virtual breakfast yeah my virtual break and eggs i think we're all in consider we all agree it's virtual right no one disagrees okay that's all i had uh i thank you very much for for a good meeting we'll see everybody on the 19th and if we get a motion to adjourn in a second we will go home at ten o'clock we beat our one o'clock record here any way of motion tell me a second second all in favor hi hi everyone have a good night stay safe stay safe and healthy thanks thank you"
