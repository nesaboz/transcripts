    "transcript": "foreign foreign [Music] good evening everyone welcome to the Bel Air Beach April 17 2023 city council work session it is now 6 p.m please rise and join me for the Pledge of Allegiance Betty would you please call the roll council member Frank Banker where is it council member Belinda Livingstone president council member Leslie Notaro president council member Lloyd Roberts here council member Mike Sable here vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave Gaddis here city manager Kyle riefler here and City attorney Randy Mora present thank you Patty all right we'll just uh move right on into item one well I tell you what before we do uh we're going to try to take a hard break at 7 30 and uh and this meeting will go no longer than 9 P.M all right item one uh discussion of draft ordinance for city code sections 38 through 80 or 38.87 picnic or public gathering permit uh this was placed on the agenda by City attorney Mora uh and I believe he emailed us some supplemental contacts thank you council members my apologies for the and transmission as I was traveling much of last week you have before you a draft proposed ordinance we are not on first reading we are not on second reading we are workshopping and see that for your benefit but also for the the public who may be observing this process um this issue came up somewhat unexpectedly this is not in response to any specific event in your community or gathering that I'm aware of um in fact historically the city's records don't reveal any instances where anybody was cited in violation of section 3887 or had issues with permitting um from the city or to unreasonable or unfounded denials in last month the city received uh correspondence from an organization that Advocates on issues of constitutional law and they presented or made the city aware of some constitutional defects with the ordinance in its current form this draft seeks to address some of those I will say both for the benefit of the record and for that of you council members in the event you haven't seen the latest and greatest we did receive correspondence from them shortly before this meeting was called to order communicating additional concerns and defects perceived defects with the current draft before drafting this I did send correspondence to them last week asking for any suggestions sample ordinances they find suitable if based on the concerns they'd raised until this evening I had not received that so it's an ongoing dialogue there's no real urgency to adopting an amendment yet because again we're not responding to a oppressing exigency in our community and better to get it right than to get it done fast that said the ordinance about before you is modeled after elements I've seen in order several other ordinances that clearly sought to address these constitutional concerns that were raised about vagueness in the um in the existing ordinance on what is a political event what is a religious event are they afforded sufficient protection Etc I'm happy to go to speak to any element of this I did as I try to do highlight the things that are most that are true that are not legal but are just placeholders if you will hey I put 21 days notice for a permit if you want to make that 10 or 14 you can do that that didn't come from the Supreme Court or anything similarly I set the presumption of a gathering at 30 presently it's at nine the reason I increase that number and again that remains subject to your discretion one of the reasons I increase that number is arguably a 10 person basketball game could go you know five on five gets you above nine I was trying to get to something that wasn't as of much concern to the community again dating back to some of the records we do have some of the language that we have in our ordinance presently was last put in in 2018 in response to people showing up city parks and hosting events like weddings extemporaneously putting out the chairs the tents Etc and never really checking with anybody and of course using that space to the exclusion of others without getting any permits Insurance all those other things in the materials I sent you I sent you the draft proposed ordinance I sent you the correspondence history between the parties and that organization's name is fire they are based out of Philadelphia um and again we have an open in dialogue with fire and their concerns the other thing I did include just for point of reference was Florida statute 316.2045 that that was that's on obstructing public streets highways and roads this was adopted by the legislature during the 2021 legislative session it was candidly done in response to the social unrest of 2020 and some of the the street obstructions and Highway obstructions that had occurred the ordinance is actually part of a broader um constitutional challenge that's directed to that statute so that may be um there were awaiting judicial rulings on that it's a footnote in that case it's more towards the educational limits and all the other things but it was part of a broader stop look active adoption um that that has faced its own constitutional challenges and the courts are still dealing with that but I did raise that in as much as you may have concerns about well what are we doing about keeping our streets clear Etc there is a statute on point and I don't really think we need to tread into that any further than the statute already provides in my advice to you to the extent the statute isn't self-enforceable and so um with that I'm happy to answer any questions um the correspondence you receive from fire identified various um that we received this evening from fire identify various concerns urging you not to adopt this and to give them time up until April 28th to provide their own sample language um again because we're not in a position of exigency here personally I see no issue with saying great get us your comments sooner the better so that we can make them part of any main materials depending on whether this body desires to Workshop this further or have it on first reading subject to whatever feedback you give me tonight or they give me at that point if we find it useful so with that I'm happy to answer any questions comments concerns about the substance and form of this ordinance yes ma'am did you say that the the section 316 is under review now it is there so there's a series of constitutional challenges that were directed to the stat the statutory adoption I forget the house poll and Senate bill number but that enactment in 2021 they there's like a footnote in there of in addition to all our other concerns hey this is a little over broad or vague or you know um as as written but we don't there's been no ruling on that it's not the primary um argument in the litigation but there is a legal argument directed to it some court at some point yeah it is it is there may be some judicial uh resolution of that Mr Moore uh since you sent them A draft copy of what good enough um are they uh do they understand the variables uh are they highlighted the copy that they received so that they they know that we may want to change the numbers and we don't um they know they they I didn't specifically tell them the highlighted text is variables um they seem pretty uh well versed in legislative adoptions and and that to the extent they raised concerns this evening um one of them was not nine none of them was directed to the number like hey 30 is no good or 100's no good um they suggested there may be some inconsistencies in those numbers which I would look at and review I don't know if that's borne out um but regardless they're they're aware this is in working form um I sent it to them you received this transmission Saturday afternoon and within 20 minutes I'd forwarded it to them as well to keep that because they are the primary shareholder advocating on this position I wish to keep that communication Line open one more question what do you think that the what's the over relying motivation of wanting to do this for us because at first it appeared that they wanted to do this to us and now it's more they want to help us so what what's the what yeah in Game of this I can't speak to to motivations and and perceptions what I can say is I think that when you are in public activism and this is a form of public activism and while that term has become loaded in the last four years that is at its core what this is supposed to be um this activism you're accustomed to dealing in a confrontational approach right you are speaking truth to power or telling power hey you may have done this wrong and ordinarily power doesn't respond well if you will um to that and so the diet the the Paradigm is usually one of Confrontation our response to them was not pounds in it's our ordinances do what we'll do what we want get lost while they while they started from a place of Confrontation I think our response saying hey thanks for bringing this to our attention we'll see if we can do better if we can great if it meets with your satisfaction wonderful if not well we'll see where our disagreements are and how principled we are about those but I think that our approach in responding to them and saying we'll take a look at this we intend to redraft this and if you have input let us know well then that's just the legislative process so now they're all where they want to be a part of the dialogue on what gets codified I I don't think that's all that um unusual in that respect as far as why in The Great Wide World of the United States did this organization find our ordinance and why why now why the very immediate attention to it once it was presented I don't know I'm not I'm not in their boardrooms I'm not in their um list serves or anything to speak to what their priorities are I can tell you in the last year or so and they're very clear about this the organization pivoted from one that used to be focused on campuses to one that's focused and this is a pretty low-lying fruit as far as the ordinance reads in its current form to say hey I think there's some problems here my draft was again modeled after various ordinances um that and where I saw the you know you talk mean median mode the mode where what are the most frequent kinds of language we find and trying to incorporate those as was noted in a hearing last week on another legislative adoption in another Community where an attorney came to the microphone he said you know it's very very easy it's very very difficult to draft an ordinance it's very easy to challenge ones I look at this one I could find dozens of things to challenge whether or not those are you know where we're focused is something else and so um that's all I can speak to that okay uh Council uh Mike said yeah um yeah because that's really my first question you know why Target at us but I think yeah I really think we've been targeted by somebody or uh somebody else because we're an exceptionally small City and for them to go after a small City with no Financial recourses seems like a hit job um second of all I think you got my statement about over 30 we regularly go over 30 where we're doing sandbags outside and that's not a scheduled event that just yeah you did send me um correspondence in response to the the circulation stating we should make an additional exception for sandbag distribution in its current form the ordinance provides that no permit or anything is necessary for city-sponsored events that would be a city-sponsored event there's also an exception for assemblies where people are lawfully directed to assemble and we are directing them come here and get your sandbags so I think in its current form that would be sufficient but um you know again depending on how this um if at all this gets revised and how it gets revised I would keep my eye on that issue thank you okay final point is I'd like you to contact League of cities and find out is anybody else got that letter that'll tell me a lot that they are just we're trying to help you but Bellaire Beach somebody turned you in somebody's gunning for you for the only person we're sitting in Florida that is being basically attacked so can we find out for anybody I mean if anybody else I'm happy to inquire the league of cities may not necessarily be subject to the public records laws in the same ways or but they could tell us if their members are getting similar inquiries actually my recommendation just to avoid wasting our precious attorney money yeah you have the contacts just reach out to anyone there and ask the question um all at the end of the day our ordinance was bad and and uh it just had never been called out and uh anyone else yeah well I know the organization I don't know Aaron I did speak to Aaron on the phone today I think this resonated from when we tried to uh force a permit on those Jehovah Witnesses something something spurred up the chain of command but I have an easy solution here and I think he's he was 100 in agreement with it because me and him were going over the ordinance that you submitted and I said man there are so many challenges here it's crazy it's eliminating eliminate that little 38 whatever it is done and over with I mean what does it serve us to have 38-87 picnic or public gathering permit have we ever issued a permit have we ever been asked for a permit we don't need it to put nine pages in the muni code how much is that going to cost us I believe we do issue permits we do for a pavilion at uh Morgan Park for Morgan Park yes how about here birthday party yeah yeah it's it's the way that you prevent chaos Whenever two groups don't be able to have a reservation that's running the hole right or not the hall the The Pavilion right what exchanging funds that's what I'm saying correct or yes um if it's a if it's a non-resident there's a fee if it's a resident then that um requirement of insurance right yeah yeah so this doesn't address any of that like the requirements of fees or anything like that so eliminate 38 87 and this whole thing goes away if that's the will of the of the of the council I'm happy to do so again uh my direction was give me another draft and and you know while I appreciate the concern about the length of the ordinance as I looked at samples I could there was a handful of samples that were a page or two um that were much more succinct but then they had more robust other sections that dealt with elements of this um most Community many communities I would say have some form of special event permitting process in place when you think of going to a county and wanting to reserve the Pavilion at you know John Chestnut Park in in North County if you want to reserve Pavilion five you don't want to show up and find out there's a 5k that's decided to use it that day um that's usually what this regime is for and again you folks are better versed in how your resources are used and what's necessary I defer to you I'm not taking some Hardline stance on this I we can add to subtract from whatever you whatever you wish that's why it's a work session I welcome your input and thank you Mr bankert for that point yeah but I'm saying but that's not what this ordinance 3867 says or 87 cents okay yes okay you can have a picnic this is for I want to have a gathering out front I need a perm that's that's illegal okay it's how are you against your first sorry time police manner restrictions are lawful well I'll tell you one thing for a guides you've done this over a hundred times on picket lines I don't think it is illegal if I want to put a picket line up front I could put a pickle on out front understood certain certain things um you can lock me up I I don't think I'm gonna I don't lock anybody no I'm just saying you have the sheriff lock me up I'm sure I'm going to get out but uh what I'm saying is this is unnecessary language and it's just costing us time and money understood it wasn't I think uh it was brought up at the last meeting it was adapted in something like 2018. the language is a form of the language has been in there since 1981. subsection B that addressed the the um the subsection B in the current form that added the no permits shall be granted for the conduct of any commercial political organized event that language appeared in 2018 but the sub a has been a version of sub a has been in your code for um more than 30 years almost 40 I believe you're actually section basic catch 22. section B is the most problematic part of it yeah unquestionable fit because we're not going to Grant a permit so you're not going to Grant a permit you're going to have well and I want to be very clear for the record I didn't write it my firm didn't work here at the time I can't speak to that I just I'm my my task was give me an alternative We Gather some information maybe to address your concerns like how many permits have we shoot or had requests for and just so we can look at it and see if it's even an issue just off top of my head it's usually one two Max a year and it's only Morgan Park that we've done permits for and and is that for like a wedding it's been for a wedding or a photographs or just a resident Gathering that they wanted to ensure that the Pavilion was available how many have been denied none none okay uh what what I'm reading in the whereas the second whereas statement is the city has a legitimate ability and duty to regulate the safe and responsible administration of its limited recreational resources and facilities for the protection of public health safety and Welfare of its residents and visitors um I I don't see why there's uh such an urgency to eliminate it um it may not be something that we use often but what if it becomes that way and what if suddenly it is uncontrollable because we no longer have an ordinance to to control to keep order in chaos that's that's my two cents on it any other council members like to comment yes Miss Livingstone I don't think that it matters why they brought this to our attention I think that it matters that we resolve it because it is unconstitutional and I agree with Mr Mora that um we wait see what his thought process is and we construct it based on on that and let attorney Mora do his due diligence in in doing some further research on our behalf I agree with you 100 I also think that um that really having uh both legal teams Mr Mora being his own team uh working through this together is saving both organizations uh plenty of money and uh the quicker that that we can satisfy their requirements uh the quicker we can put this to bed and I think that both organizations Us and Them will be uh happy with the outcome and this will quietly go away so perhaps ask the other legal team for their input on or maybe suggestions Redline on what attorney Moore has done so then at that point they can coordinate and go okay let's just go through this and see where we meet I believe that's what Mr Moore stated they would do they did provide that this evening okay um that email I'm sorry I'm just trying to switch on my Outlook that email came through at about um 5 17 p.m on my server um so I I reviewed it while I was you know sitting in the car right before I walked in um they identified at least six different issues um at least and they say it's not an exhaustive list of the Constitutional issues with proposed ordinances language fire and again that's their acronym urges the city not to enact the proposed amended ordinance in its current form they'd be pleased to submit no later than April 28th for mine in the council's consideration a proposed ordinance that seeks to address the city's concerns while protecting the exercise of First Amendment rights in the city's parks and other public areas um so that's that is their present position there are they are willing to participate in a collaborative dialogue and I don't wish to represent anything to the contrary all right so my my recommendation on this would be that let's go ahead and go through the uh the few variables and uh let's just see if we can agree on that and uh and then if if that passes the test then uh Mr Moore can pass that information on along to Fire and uh and let's see what they come back with does everyone agree with that a little bit about that all right so uh let's head over to page number two of the draft uh the 100 or more people Mr Mori would you like to explain that uh as it's written and again this language I I found this language in another the actual and I understand how there's some concern or concerning confusion here it says that any it is presumed so it establishes a rebuttable presumption but it's presumed any evidence any event on private property which involves an open invitation of the public to its end or events where the attendance is by private invitation of a hundred or more people are presumed to be an event with a significant impact on public resources basically are presumed to be events that need a permit um so if you're sending out invitations and you're inviting 150 people we're not going to wait to see if 20 people showed up or 40 people showed up it's presumed by your invite list that you are going to be having an event that requires permitting that's that language and I wish to cross-reference that with the language which on page four at the top that says that groups of 30 fewer people in a city park are not considered um are not considered basically the threshold of 31 people for getting a permit if you plan to have 31 people you need to get a permit unless um so if you're less than 30 or 30 or less I should say sorry if you're 30 or less you don't need a permit unless you're doing things for sale or trade you're setting up a booth you're selling things the Gathering has a significant impact on the ordinary use at city park and the Gathering requires or makes use of the construction erection or maintenance of any building structure or equipment or scaffolding at that point okay you're not just hey we're all getting together for a picnic we're putting up booths and tables and a stand and the likes um that's what that the comparison between that hundred and thirty languages because I did get a question about that so that's a consistency issue on page two of their letter coming back to you uh right at the top third about internal consistencies that's one of the that's I think I think it can be harmonized but I do understand that is one of the concerns they've raised about internal inconsistencies and it's probably just because they didn't understand the it's possible I mean I'm not suggesting that this is immaculate drafting this is a working draft in discussion and definitely could benefit from a more careful review on my part in any input you folks have I'm not suggesting that this is infallible um I'm willing to look at their comments I haven't had time to digest them in review of the draft I don't think anyone's had time to address it but it's kind of tough to read this and compare it to the draft on the fly so I don't I don't even know if it's worth spending our time on it at this work session well there were I think that was really the conflict and and uh really I would say that we just need to agree or disagree that the 100 or more people for a uh for a party uh is that is that what we're looking for what I would say mayor is and and um Mr earlier points are well taken that I'm not asking you to harmonize their comments in this draft my ask at this point is whether your stance is to go and a direction similar to Mr Bankers we don't need any of this or we don't need some of this or we would like to see more if any of you having unders and again my apologies for the Saturday transmission but in the time that you have had to review just this draft was there anything that stood out to you that was like get rid of it or this isn't doing enough so that I know going forward in addition to whatever their comments they give me that I'm carrying your water as my client to say it's really important to me that we do X Y or Z if there's anything like that in this ordinance or that needs to be in this ordinance please let me know so that when we come back we're in a better position um that would be my ask at this time and I hear remember bankert's very clear feelings on on the fact that none of this is necessary and again if that's the stance of the council I'm happy to go in that direction I I think if you cancel the vote to say we're going to do away with his board okay quench fire well of course because then the ordinance doesn't exist okay but then we can come back and address the last paragraph of a which is really what we need the city manager may require any person or group seeking to use public property at the city to provide the city manager with a certificate of liability insurance okay that's really what we're concerned about that we don't get sued if somebody gets hurt right and we adapt this works someone contacted fire up in Philadelphia it's Aaron used to be with the as ACLU I mean they got a lot of uh left wing politics aside yeah I think yeah and I I dealt with them up there I mean um they can be a real pain in the um what I'm sitting on but I think you put this to bed right away just say hey we're not going to go forward we're killing it he suggested to me today why don't you just table and let us work on it I said why don't we just kill it well that would do it you know it definitely would do it uh but I am a firm believer that ordinances are put in place for a reason and and there there must have been a reason why this was it was put in our city code no argument I said he said that you know once or twice a year and the vice mayor said once or twice a year I don't want the city getting sued because somebody well you were here when the guy fell walking to his car supposedly you know all right so I don't I don't want to see that happen but I mean uh the last sentence is a good sentence but we can re-adapt that later for the sake of clarity to the extent um fires representation or whether it was Mr Turf specifically or fires representation was you know why don't we table this while we work through it that's precisely where we're at there's no I just I needed in Clarity in the record there is no effort to presently enforce this and no one is being you know held to account for this so that's where we are we are trying to work work through this draft in whatever form um this Council needs a property they're fully aware of that and uh they they realize they've gotten our attention and they're trying to to solve a problem well it's on their website and if we kill the ordinance it'll be on their website that fire made this big well I disagree though what we should be doing is if you're going to do that just take all this the entire city code and throw it out the door no I didn't say it at all you just insisted on throwing out something that had a reason reason behind it all right gentlemen one at a time please oh anyway what we do have to do at least recommendation is like it's all a great start just again they will just let them work with it but we don't really have a feel for the numbers because there may be reasoning behind them like they fire pointed out early excuse me yeah before um to let the attorneys figure out and then they can come back and go okay here's the reason behind the 100 or here's the reason that we said no to a hundred just negotiation between the two and so that we craft a better thing because we do have a responsibility we have a limited resource and that limited resource is not it I mean it should not be a free-for-all trying to who's going to be parked in that space first to grab the venue there should be a way to reserve ahead of time so you know on the 15th I could get my daughter married and not show up and have a 10 year old birthday party there and I thank you Mr zabel I I think your point uh made now Mr Banker uh you're you're welcome to robot well my rebuttal is again um put this thing to bed okay as Mrs Abel said we have a limited resource of funds okay rather than not try and take money out of your pocket Mr Moore but this is all retainer work no one no money's taking that whatever whatever you have you have better things to do than this um in my opinion and bring this up on another day Let It Die and resurrected in another fashion other comments from the council no I meant uh just quickly I meant not a limited research money but a limited resource of parks that are available I I understand any other comments comments on this particular issue that's going back on this particular issue what I'm about to do is I'm going to ask for a consensus on do we um start do we move in the direction that Mr Banker would like for us to move into or would the council prefer to continue going down the road we're going right now with with Mr Mora and fire working together so uh let's just start with vice mayor Shirley are just discussing hermit permits for our parks which we have one park that is really I guess this well we have two parts that could be an issue um I think it's important that we keep an ordinance on the books that it requires a permit for special Gatherings um I don't know that it needs to be this complicated so I'm I'm indifferent I'm kind of I don't know I I don't know how to answer that Dave quite honestly on the fence on the fence it's Livingstone um I'm in agreement with allowing attorney Mora to move forward I believe that the process does need to be in place no matter how simple or complicated something needs to be put in place and let's wait and see what fire has to say council member Roberts yes I think we should keep the ordinance and I'm I'm confident that once we go through this process um with our legal counsel and fires legal counsel that this thing probably will get minimized somewhat to where it's more clear and more directed to the things that we need but I do need I do feel comfortable that we need an ordinance in place Mr Banker well right now this word interest in advance so we don't have an ordinance to enforce right now so it's still a lawfully and it's still an ordinance am I not correct that we're not unfortunate though correct we're not enforcing it I'm just saying that doesn't take it off our books right but it's in the Bands then sir yes sir okay so what I'm saying is you cater to these organizations someone else is going to come after you because you show weakness so hey yeah this was an unconstitutional thing we're removing it three months down the road Miss Notaro I suggest that uh attorney Mora go ahead with the people from the fire to work out a solution I don't think we should abandon the ordinance at this point council member Sable Bankers last comment but I recommend that we go forward with attorney Warren and allow them to work together to coordinate this effort uh I am sort of on the fence to uh much like council member or uh vice mayor Shirley is however [Music] um in response to Council May uh council member Bankers comments about um it will show us uh letting them push us around we have to respond one way or the other so that argument's already over um right now I think that that the best decision for this city is to let them continue and if we don't like the outcome then we change our Direction and we kill it is that fair enough is everyone on the same page all right Mr Mori you have your instructions understood thank you very much I do have a quick question I know the numbers um are fluid but when I was reading um permit application process where we highlighted 21 days and then on the grounds for denial they've talked about uh absent and approved waiver the permanent application is submitted less than 60 days prior to the event thank you so those numbers would have to be the same number change that 60 to 21 and failed to change that other okay and so whatever the number is it seems to be the same number yes sir perfect perfect the other thing about City staff not having enough they only have two people I understand I I was working in consistently what your two people are presently doing I'm just saying so strong poker game We're not gonna have enough yeah all right moving right along to item number two which is discussion on strategic plan score card this was placed on the agenda by city manager refler three for you have the floor thank you mayor um everyone I believe has a larger version okay great okay that one's a little easier to read um thank you so this um this goal came off of uh appendix B of the city manager's contract and um just as a rehash it says develop and integrate a city of Bellaire Beach dashboard or scorecard to the purpose of the document would be to specifically succinctly synthesize the metrics necessary uh to efficiently assess the progress or status of the city strategic plans goals and their relationship to the city's budget CIP and code enforcement efforts so given that description of the goal this is my interpretation in my first draft of trying to summarize that information and as it how it relates to our strategic plan our projects uh the the dollars that we're spending and our code enforcement efforts so if you go to the top I started with the uh the 2023 budget year projects and listed those on the next column over shows an estimated completion um some of them are completed so that um we're not just keeping the current projects we're keeping track of the ones that have gotten completed um so then I kind of broke it down by the year and quarter that we expect the completion um just uh you know that may be something that changes uh depending on uh how the project moves along it'll be updated um and then what I did is to uh sort of uh I guess quantify how these projects are hitting the five areas or five goals of the Strategic plan I I use ones and zeros so one obviously is if it if I felt that that project hit um that specific goal versus a zero if it just did not uh address it at all um so then you can see as I Mark through the projects um some ones and zeros and there were the total goals hit um it gives it sort of a weight of what it's hitting um as far as this strategic plan is concerned I also included the city's costs of the projects some of them were done by staff or or a combination of staff and volunteers so that didn't cost the city anything I just wanted to make note of it so that we could track the uh the amount of the dollars going into these projects and and going into these goals essentially um so dropping that all down um so you have all your projects and then you have your totals of each uh each goal and what the products to date how many points we've we've scored in each goal um I've I took those numbers and also broke down um the amount of dollars we we put into each goal now if you look at a goal like Golf Boulevard underground and it hits three of the goal or sorry a project is like Golf Boulevard underground he has three of the goals which was the public safety and health the tax dollar value and the Aesthetics um so then when you you bring it over it's a city's cost eight hundred and six thousand that is um that is the amount of shortfall after our Penny funding so that's why that is not the uh you know millions that was put into that project so from that current cost of coming out of our budget I took that amount and then because it hit three of the goals I the way I broke it down as I divided those those that amounts evenly across each goal so when you go down to the bottom of each goal and you see the green where it shows the dollar amount spent um that was broken uh evenly among depending on how many goals it hit and the dollars that were spent on that project that makes sense um and then you'll see something like the communication Community which I need to adjust some of these titles so they got cut off um you'll see that uh you know it totals of a hundred dollars that that I it was probably under 100 I just rounded it up but I was trying to express that there was some minimal cost for when we did The Walking easement surveys but it wasn't much so obvious that's noted um so then from these uh rankings of the the points hit per goal you know I I wanted some visuals so I did uh the pie graph kind of just shows per goal these projects you know what we covered I also did uh some bar graphs um for the for the dollar spent so that you know you can see the totals and you can see just in comparison to each other and then lastly to hit that um code enforcement aspect that was in the description of the goal um I did the code enforcement logs and what I did is I accumulated from beginning in January 2023 because that's when I really kind of fully launched this this new idea of tracking um you know our code reports um I I summarize those so the idea is um this would be something that uh a resident could find on our website they'd be able to see our current projects they'd be able to see our strategic plan and be on this website as well um and understand uh what projects we're doing and how those projects are hitting our strategic plan and what goals School nice job council members Abel yeah I'll probably on with everybody here saying this is great I only have one small thing and this is really kind of a thought if you go over to the far column something called goals hit we really can't say that we have hit those goals because some of these are obviously in the out years can we say perhaps areas covered sure that's all but everything yeah I mean we'll pile on tonight it looks great this is what at least I feel what we wanted when we wrote that contract you know I find this interesting too that our biggest code enforcement problem I guess you'd say is construction related nuisances so I know that there's there's been a lot of back and forth about the value of Outsourcing code enforcement but I would say that the deputy has done a great job of catching these problems and even though many times we we think it's unreasonable this right here this shows that yeah there's definitely a problem in Bellaire beach with unpermitted and and uh out of code uh construction and uh additions Etc so that and will we be getting this monthly now so yeah I want this I want to gather your ideas um possible changes or ways to present it differently but then what I wanted to do with your consent is to uh yes create a page and I tried to design it in a way that it wasn't overly burdensome to to keep up with um so yeah my intention is to you know keep it updated on a monthly basis along you know when we prepare the reports for this Council meetings other comments from the council yes Mr Roberts the definition of tax dollar value so what would what would that be this helped me understand that the column of taxes around you yes that goes back to um I mean the difference being fiscally responsible in our in our strategic plan I don't have the actual uh wording for that goal for example if we look at the 12 13 Street stormwater project in Bay Drive that that got a zero I did not get a one so what was the thought process on that um if I compare about it or compare it to is it based on like what was budgeted and what it actually cost let's see I'm trying to so I took projects yeah I I kind of waited out on where the cost um of the project and if like like say I gave uh undergrounding um because it was using um you know infrastructure funds like the accelerated five-year stormwater project was because it was the idea of that project coming together um to pull over the costs over right um the you know some of the stuff like that we did in-house you know I said talks text dollar value you know like some of the things that we did with the volunteers um as far as like just a straight forward um so the 12th like just purchasing the playground I didn't see any tax dollar if I was in that the city hall generator you know that I mean and that's something that you know maybe we could uh refine more how how it's scored um but I you know a term from the Strategic plan no I think it is so I think we probably need to look at the Strategic plan while we're looking at this to see some of the definitions of these terms I think you pulled it from it's kind of your cheat sheet yeah yeah but the interpretation of that is it's basically being uh getting the best bang for our buck so that was my scoring yes I get so that's fine I was just curious on the 12th and 13th Street stormwater project so that was a Miss under tax dollar value I was just curious how you came to that conclusion that that was a miss right that makes sense right yes I mean was it because that it it exceeded the budget the budgeted dollars or did it have anything to do with that at all in my mind past yep you know it did come out rather high but I'm not I'm not saying that there's exact criteria that I was facing that honor and it's not a value it's just it applies or it doesn't correct that's the one or the zero it just yeah it's just and that's just amazing so right to hit or miss so if the staff's doing it it's it's covered in our already our overhead expenses that we have budgeted if we're getting penny for Pinellas on this Gulf Boulevard undergrounding it's saving us a lot of funds because penny for Pinellas is paying for it so that's your interpretation yes is that it's not costing the city the entire amount to get the project complete we've got some savings yes and I I guess I would apply that if we had a project that we were able to obtain a grant funding from then it would be like okay we're getting a little bit more and so I mean the goals hit what that doesn't mean completed that means that this falls into these buckets these uh goals are the Strategic plan this out of five this is how many it covered okay and as you can see the only one I just thought the code enforcement project it really kind of involves everything and I think that's why you know back to the description of the city manager goal that that was a key thing I like this uh are you planning on uh putting this on the website you said yes okay great excellent any other questions or comments on this suggestions or one minor little kind of we get searching which was there and searching rentals there okay don't care no we do we do that's just something over time I played with this for hours vice mayor Shirley you uh look like you had I just have one question and it is not related to this but an item on here and the undergrounding this is the entire Gulf Boulevard our our remaining share of it right we're not just north south now we're just talking about underground in the entire world I just want to be clear on that because there's been yeah that this is uh for this year so this is talking about phase one phase two of the east side of Gulf Boulevard so maybe I should make more yeah yeah the interpretation is you just add phase one or north or south or whatever phase one is everything south of the light correct right south of Causeway and phase two is north of the marina and when will we start looking at those goals out Beyond phase one because that's still kind of an open-ended I'm sorry is that going to be when are those goals or you know we're already into 23. well into 23. when will we start setting goals Beyond 25. um I mean I guess if I can think of projects um we have I guess when are we going to review the Strategic plan would be about okay can we get that on the next work session can we start tackling that because you're going to need to know yeah that's true coming down the pike to have plans for that I agree yeah definitely need to I mean we this is telling us what we're in uh what we already have planned and we just kind of need to set our goals for the future a lot of them we already have it's just uh they're they're not in progress and I think also the it's the bond we're doing is going to drastically change this so uh we'll have new goals so the questions are comments next work session okay okay great this is good last chance before we move on to item number three item three discussion on Triton diesel generator for the community center this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefler okay thank you mayor um so yes I sent these estimates and specs um out I was a couple weeks ago and said that we would discussion discuss it in this work session um it includes two uh options the first option is the uh the original um one that we were budgeting for the natural gas on a uh elevated generator stand um in the back of the building to connect to our existing transfer switch and then the second option is what we kind of move towards down the road was the uh mobile option which was a diesel and I could I had it as used but it has not used uh um I kind of lost that over the course of all the estimates but it is a new uh generator and [Music] um some of the things some of the questions we had from the last work session when we talked about it were the maintenance adders um that the amount of uh you know increasing the amount of fuel in the diesel generator for longer uh stored run time um and then a lot of the maintenance testing so I tried I had those questions answered for these two um and if you look at the natural gas generator that that would be set up sort of like the mayor was talking about his his home generator where it would it would automatically run through tests throughout the year and then there would be a the maintenance plan including um the the staff to come out and and run a load test on it once a year which they said would be adequate for that generator the mobile generator they thought would need to be on a quarterly uh start test function which would have to be done manually because it's not an automated system like the natural gas and then the same thing it would have a load a load test annually and then as far as the tank adders go there was uh two different tank adders for the mobile option um the the Baseline tank that was quoted was a 680 liter um and then there was a three you could switch out it wasn't in addition to that 680 liters it was it was a alternate tank that was either 350 gallons or 450 gallons um and if you look at it you get an extra 100 gallons from not very much more compared to that that base price so if calculating the 100 output uh you're gonna get over five days run time I know that was a something we were considering we wanted to look at the options running that diesel um and then um as far as the storage I mean you know there's really like uh council member Banker said there's you know you can only kind of maintain this diesel for so long using additives and things like that so that's just something to consider when looking at a diesel option um and you know we could we could always have it fueled up and I I didn't I don't know if there is and I wanted to look into a way to recycle diesel or to you can buy a polishing system to polish the fuel when it's not being used so that's just something I wanted to consider that maintenance of the fuel yeah so um I think I presented everything that we were kind of discussing in the last work session related to the generators Council I think before we spend any of this money we want to be looking into our stormwater projects that are coming up seeing if we can resolve our storm water um form that we're in 2023 right now that we're not using the same ideas they had 70 years ago so I think the money would be better spent to use for storm water and for his generator that'll be nice to cool the building down for a few hours a night but uh would be better to have a water there instead of my backyard or like later thank you Mr Banker other comments yes um I apologize on the Cummins is that one new or is that used as well that is new that's new yes um and then on the on the zabat one or those Abbott Sorry Miss Livingstone is your microphone I apologize um and okay so the Cummins is new and zabat is used you have the Triton um so on the Triton it looks like I just had that marked uh if that's the one where the um estimate expires this week leave my yeah because I think they're only doing it at two or three weeks the 15th yeah but as you can see it held that price held from the last time which was five months okay then um you can see I mean I know that the lead out time for shipment um if we went with the base option is a 680 liter tank it it's in stock where the one week ship time but if you look if you add if you do some of the fuel tank adders or um at least I don't think elicited here that was going to be more of a of a 10 week time for shipping and then listed it on I believe the uh the natural gas was further out but I thought he put it on here yeah it was 30 30 days for the Cummins yeah that was just this about said um boat expires 15 days from issue date and it was issued on 4-4 so that means I mean unless they push it through again our current production lead time we've got um 50 weeks on there or I'm I was referring to this about okay um so the natural gas that would there would be some long wait time so just out of pure ignorance give me the background on generators with the city of Bel Air Beach have we had generators on this building I keep hearing about a pad that was out there um for a previous generator what did it generate how often was it used how we use it have we been out in the building ever since we moved in here that we couldn't operate or during storm lost the ability to do anything because we had no power I know that's a lot of questions no to my knowledge I mean historically the the biggest storm this building his face was Irma and it happened to knock out most of the city um and this building locked out being on a different grid I guess um and it actually kept its power as far as the history of a generator um I think that they had a generator before the building was built and they installed the transfer switch to be compatible with that generator it was a diesel um and it didn't have its own putt its own pad but it was mobile and uh over time I don't know how it was determined um if it's in the minutes anywhere but it was it was given to the Pinellas Suncoast Fire Rescue yes and I think that that one was not maintained is that right I I think that was part of it I don't think and also I believe it was wasn't it used to begin with okay I'd say yes but yeah this conversation um actually began in the last Council if you recall and uh uh it was uh there was a little controversy behind it and uh it was uh it was kind of a 50 50 I think I think ultimately in the last Council uh it it went ahead we wanted to move forward with it but we never made any progress on on actually getting something done um and then whenever we came in on this Council uh we decided to continue the conversation um and the goal was for Public Safety and for uh relief uh because uh even though this building had power that you know during Irma there's always possibility that we would have something bigger and there would be no power at all so um it was to keep the City Hall open and also to provide not shelter but temporary relief and supplies and cold water you know batteries whatever yes Mr Banker is this grid line not connected towards the causeway and uh Golf Boulevard huh it's a priority you know what I'm saying the answer to that everybody they're going to energize priority before they energize Neighbors so what I'm saying is for a building like this to be down for a long time at a time it would be a real real catastrophe where the windows would probably be blown out of here and everything um but it was like Irma which was a bad storm um we still didn't lose power yeah so are we just investing in something that we really really may not need I haven't had to use mine yeah thank you Warriors Mr Roberts yeah what is this building rated for do we know like category five category four buildings are typically rated you know to be able to I believe it was a cat or I would say but I definitely let me look into that I know that the base it was built of uh uh 12 feet elevation right because it was above the efe is based on Win Win speed right so category five category four category three that is going to survive because council member Banker has a good point if if we get hit with a 405 directly here it doesn't matter about the generator because we're gone this building's gone the houses are gone yeah nobody's coming back just to try to stay in this building to be an air conditioned so that being said I think um I think it is our responsibility to look to see that's why I was for the used approach first because it was lower cost to spend a lot of money on something that we may or may not ever use I mean basically it's going to be used in a scenario where you know it really doesn't hit here but because it hits somewhere else uh transfer centers and and do we lose power here so it's kind of cool that if this building was still up and running because of the generator and people could could still be here I mean maybe in scenarios where we're told we can't even cross the bridge we're out you know go somewhere else and they're not going to allow us back in so even if this building has air conditioning and things like that people can't get back to use it nor do they want to because they've already gone somewhere else to relatives or another town or something like that so that that was my initial question about could we get something used at a lower cost since it may not be used that much or ever that was my whole question about the caustic other comments not with councilman Roberts that was well stated yes so um is the council leaning towards killing this completely or looking at used or looking at uh new Natural Gas is it something you'd like to table and discuss after Hurricane Season I like to table it until we get the storm water and stuff figured out it doesn't seem like that's going to be a problem is that correct that we're going to be fully funded for our storm water projects now I understand what he's wanting is going to require sure more money and and basically digging up you have to change a lot and I I understand your uh desire to have this collection Pond and these pumps and everything but I don't see that happening in our community because of the you would have to tear up everyone's property to make that happen is that right well um I've brought up I've had discussions uh preliminary discussions with two engineering firms about the uh combined stormwater projects that we're doing and I have brought up the idea of the council member Banker said with the retention uh tanks and and the general feedback I've gotten is that it'll be very expensive but I'm not saying I'm just giving them that idea to to consider um not as part of what we're doing with these projects but bringing it up um with bringing up 7th Street as like okay we ran into this problem um you know looking at the the future bmps I'm like the lowest outfall um of projects we haven't done yet would probably be 9th Street and um I wanted to bring up the problem that we're experiencing at 7th Street of it if there's a design something we can do differently um to prevent that from being like that and and I I do want you know I I'm I have the construction set I couldn't find um exact ads built of 7th Street before what I was told by the engineer who worked on it is that the construction set there was very little changes so I am giving that to the engineering firms just for ideas of trying to solve the the issue we're having at 7th Street with the low outfall yes Mr Sable um Mr Mayor I don't know if you've ever brought that up to The Big C uh but ask the other Mayors do they have generators in their City Halls I mean the ones that are kind of coastal I can certainly ask because that kind of give us a good direction I mean councilman Roberts brought her right out if uh if it really does hit everything's wiped otherwise you know we should have enough power here and see what the other City Halls do and as far as the portable diesel generator goes um if it if we ran into a circumstance to where we had to use it um just out of the box or or the default configuration you only get what less than 48 hours oh the yeah the the original Baseline okay and then if you spend the extra money and you get the larger tanks well then maybe you get five days but uh by now I mean by that time you've spent 150 000 yeah roughly uh trying to put this configuration together and there's always the uh the possibility that um something could go wrong in Towing it could something could happen to it um I like the idea of of looking into a discounted option but I don't think I don't think that it's uh a good idea for us to be lugging something that large around and do we even have something that would like pull that or would it take a like a big rig yeah yeah that that's all we'd have to use that John Deere but I'd still have to check verify the problem is when you don't run an engine it gives you problems yeah and the only way is to drain everything out of it and then you know storms coming for us and then it switches right so that's mayor Shirley just then added there's no guarantee when you have a hard piped natural gas line that it's going to remain active during a storm yeah they're often turned off and I'll tell you from first first-hand experience on diesel Jones I ran over 10 000 of these in Iraq and you better have maintenance on pretty much 24 7 if you wanted to work because you talk about water in the fuel high humidity and you guys run diesel engines out here they're a pain to maintain our humidity I think that's what we were pretty much yeah it's that's a that's a nightmare for diesel all right what's uh what's our current uh right now how much money do we have set aside for the generator project so this year we totaled 250 000 in savings so there doesn't need to be spent on that but we did like a two-year savings um okay 125 each Council Let's uh let's go around the room uh should we consider killing this and repurposing for something else vice mayor Shirley I'm in favor of killing it and repurposing that money somewhere else councilmember Livingstone I'm in agreement Mr Roberts yes Mr bankert I just like to use the word table [Laughter] killenberry um I like to do that yeah I agree with them but with the attic also if you could just ask a Big C of any other City Halls are doing it Chris Notaro kill it okay you know what I'll agree let's just uh we'll we'll find something else to do with that money all right thank you hey uh now we're up to um I'm four let me see here yeah we're still fine item four discussion of Merit increase for city manager this was uh added to the agenda by council members Abel Mr zabel you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor um as brought up we had a lot of questions going in to um hiring Kyle as a city manager and we worked with him we've had all these ideas and frankly I mean at least to my knowledge he's knocked it out of the park um tore that end I really don't want to wait till later I mean he's he's doing everything we've asked for him right now that's why I proposed it's time to get that Merit increase now not wait for a two-year period Council Mr Banker I mentioned that at the last meeting that he deserves a raise I like the two-year freeze when we promoted him I think he's doing an excellent job not one complaint please have an answer and would I like it when you don't have an answer you'll say you'll get one uh Mr Banker I'm going to have to correct you there have been plenty of complaints from citizens I can assure you oh yes [Laughter] I stand correct all right I'm I'm going to make a comment on this right quick uh I am not object to uh looking into this however I'm gonna I'm gonna pull a vice mayor Shirley show me the numbers where are the numbers at to back up this argument because we um I I thought that we were making a very fair uh and adequate salary at the time that we gave you the increase and uh I need a refresher course I have no evidence in front of me to support this argument this time other comments well he's been attending a lot of city manager meetings I don't know what your age is I'm not I don't really care but uh in my opinion he's young compared to me um he's making himself no um he doesn't live right here someone might come out there and try to say hey Kyle why don't you entertain our city throw you another ten twenty thousand dollars 10 miles closer to your home shown that you can do this job I think we grab him and I think we shine to a contract give him a three four percent three or five percent raise he deserves it um we were willing to pay the other guy with 150 Grand we're still saving money take the money out of the generator fund Mr Roberts I agree about seeing some of the numbers I think Kyle's doing a great job at the time and I can't remember what happened last week or they did the last time we talked about those numbers but we were comparing to other cities in the area to see what those salaries were out there and what the experience time and position was for those particular city managers so it would be nice um councilman was able we can kind of see those as we compared to what other people were making and just to see what makes sense that's all councilmember Livingstone you have any comments yes I do um I'm in agreement with you as far as we need to see some figures we are stewards of the citizens money however that being said I'm also an advocate for annual increases um I don't know I wasn't here when you did the two-year and I don't know why it was put into place and maybe some history on that but I'm a big advocate of annual and he'll reach his annual what in is it November or um so that'll give us plenty of time to review the the data thank you vice mayor Shirley yeah if you recall um well first off I wasn't in favor of paying the other guy more money so I'll just start with that wasn't in favor of the other guy um but um I when we made the decision to bring Kyle on I you know it was a great decision Kyle's doing you're doing a wonderful job um we did have some areas where he had the lack of experience or education that many wanted doesn't mean a thing to me so my my Olive Branch was hey let's take that first year first couple years and work through some of these certificate programs and I believe that's what he's doing and so he's carrying his end of the bargain and I'm prepared to carry my end of the bargain and that is you know you keep doing what you're doing get through these certificate programs and and then we'll evaluate and that was kind of the thought process when he was brought on so and like you know so my my feeling is yes I'll look at anything but I am one too I make an agreement I agree to it and I hold to it to that end and because member Livingstone wasn't a member I do want to make clear that um Mr reefler does have a contract an employment contract it is a three-year contract term section four of the contract addresses salary just because I don't know that the space line has been articulated uh for the first two years of the agreement the city agrees to compensate Mr riesler in the annual amount of a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars for her services at city manager paid on a bi-weekly basis beginning in the third year of the contract term managers entitled to an increase in base salary as determined by the city council the increase shall take effect on the anniversary date of the agreement so in the third year of the agreement same annual percentage as other city employees the renewal remains subject however to satisfactory performance evaluations Etc as you talk about and and this is just a good um contextualization moment as you talk about his annual um uh date is in November and we can revisit it then you're doing you're at presently beginning stages of doing your budget or for fiscal year 23 24 and that would be something that it would be most prudent to provide for in whatever budget you adopt on first and second reading in September of this year um so if you're contemplating a change to the contract that would mean an increase at any point before the third year um that would now would be a good time to discuss that if that any point is coming up um but I did want to make sure everybody had that same context yeah thank you Mr Mora council member Notaro you have any comment I agree with what vice mayor surely is that the contract as as it was and we should stick to it I uh um I I still think that uh I mean we'll still be doing a yearly review and and we'll be able to kind of gauge his progress and uh I say that we revisit it again at that time fair enough yes just a note he's been doing this job since June of what last year doing it for a year I had to call the old city manager once yeah I think correct I think uh whenever he left he was done yeah I think you had one phone call that was about it maybe so yeah yeah all right um if there's no other comments on that particular topic we're actually doing pretty good on time why don't why don't we take a break let's just go ahead and knock that break out and then we'll come back the track here uh Patty it's uh 7 23 and Mr Mora is back so uh all right so now we're on to item number five the discussion of sending letter from the city of Bellaire Beach to the hoteliers very good of clear water regarding traffic and congestion this was placed on the agenda by council members Abel Mr zabel well um I thought about this and I think all of us at one time another looking at the traffic and we're really the linchpin you know if we go down so does Clearwater jokingly I think I told somebody what we should do is put signs up saying you know dead end you know no through for it but we can't you can't get away another city council and expect them to act on our behalf because frankly everything there is paid by their hotel so maybe another route is businesses are very receptive when one organization contacts them directly for example fire I mean hey they contacted us nicely uh perhaps and again I'm just shooting at windmills on this one is send them a letter um I know a letterhead undersigned directly to the general managers of each of these hotels and this is a draft shot um saying come on down um you know talk to us we have a lot of concerns with how much traffic you're putting through our city um we were the main route other than the Clearwater bridge I mean you all know the problem so I just it's a shotgun out there you know yes no it's an attempt so Council one thing I did was the last couple when I first got on Council people were addressing this yeah so last couple months especially during spring break from 10 o'clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon heavy heavy traffic and I'm talking it's all we backed up from the Chevron station 8th Street on East on West Bay so I took my scooter down you know we're 90 of traffic goes in the Sand Key part and if you go into Sand Key park right it fills up all four parking spots from like Friday Saturday and Sunday now go back down there around six o'clock at night and a lot of people are going across the bridge into Clearwater for whatever dinner but that Sand Key Park is I think the biggest thorn in our side and I don't know how you would eliminate that and the parking there is I swear it said five dollars for the five hours till sunset um which is ridiculous in my opinion but I mean that parking lot gets overly abundant and they have weddings there they I mean the beaches are packed and it's just it's just a constant filter making a left-hand turn from Gulf Boulevard so I uh I was caught in the traffic Saturday was and uh there was a huge backup it started uh at Indian Rocks Beach where everyone is you've got right turns left turns and you've got straight in and it's all filtering in and the bridge was backed up all the way to the next traffic light which was which is our traffic light uh funny thing is is as soon as the light changed and I hopped in that traffic we were going again we were actually moving it's not the same direction and the reason why we're having more I think the main reason why we're having so many backups is because of the timing of the traffic light and how I always get turned around in here but yeah you're headed headed towards Indian Rock speech the light changes and that's where all the traffic's coming from we have it coming from across the bridge and you have it coming from here it's actually holding every the traffic light is holding everybody back as soon as you get past the traffic light it opens up so all of this traffic problem is benefiting Sand Key and Clearwater Beach and we're all getting smacked for uh to make it better for north of Bel Air Beach you said traffic going to Indian Rocks Beach are you talking about Indian Rocks Road or Indian Rocks Beach no no traffic's coming from Indian Rocks Beach okay and I think probably what's happening is uh they're either they're they're tourists that are staying in that area and they're going to the cool the cool place or um or that's an alternate route also to avoid traffic coming in they're coming over that walls bridge I mean probably so that's very backed up too yeah um is there a since you looked into is there an association that but has all these hotels underneath you know like there are other organizations like that off my head I don't remember yeah there's Hotel associations but yeah I'm just saying that for Clear Water because and I'm just thinking you know be a nice neighbor hey you know we've got an impact here I've been here nine years and I think they destroyed Clearwater in my opinion they used to have all these mom-and-pop hotels on there and now they tore them all down and now they just make them higher and higher and higher and higher right they bring more and more people but I think the people I think the people that are going to the hotels aren't using our bridge I think they're going in 360. I think the people going in for the nightly entertainment are using are I don't know because I see uh Saturday morning they're all coming in there it's everybody's coming in and Sunday evening everybody's leaving so I I believe they are staying the night and uh it's I I don't have a problem signing this and sending it on but I have a feeling they're just going to tell us the pound sand at least we try it where do you send it where do you send it to get some well I mean I think the the problem is is that uh there's several problems um and please chime in yeah this is just uh I I channel uh many meetings around the uh the county and uh and I speak to the Mayors on The Big C and uh uh Suncoast and and the mayor's Council and um I I think really the problem is is that Pinellas County is hell-bent on bringing as many people into the county for tourism as they possibly can because make a crap ton of money off of it and what happens is even though we get a little bit of money we don't really care it's not enough to for the the inconvenience that we have and and and and one of the the things that I've been trying to do is to to get myself inserted to where we have more of a voice so I'm I'm trying to get on uh the uh tourist Development Council and uh with with me being there I can put more of an emphasis on giving us sand rather than than bringing in more tourists because really at the end of the day it's the beaches that brought everybody here in the first place and um you know the tourist Development Council their their main focus right now is baseball stadiums and uh Sports complexes and uh the dolly Museum and um I think that little towns like us we need Fair representation otherwise this is just going to keep happening and eventually our property values going to be worth nothing because no one's going to want to live here um but as far as this goes I I'm all for signing this and sending it on and uh who does you you're sending this to Wyndham I say we do it to all of them just to see if we get anything you know just a draft this is rough I mean is there an association for I don't what are we asking them to do really know I don't know if they're really going to Care yeah I mean you're asking them to to spend money uh to help us whenever that they don't really there's no incentive for them to do that the problem lies in permitting and we have no say in them issuing permit the only play only time they're gonna spend money is when they need a permit and their impact fees don't require them to put walkovers that's I mean that would solve a lot of the problem the roundabout backs up people can't get through that way um but they allow pedestrians to cross the road wherever the heck they please which stops traffic stops traffic here stops traffic at the top of the bridge no one is using walkovers the way they should it's and a lot of the times I think we're backed up and we're not it's just that crosswalk up there at the top of the bridge that people randomly press the button and we end up backing up the bridge for or the traffic beyond the bridge so it's hard to tell but we're not going to get anything from these guys you know I'm sorry hold on um you know it's just we'd like to hear your plans for removing this burden which pretend you're the hotel guy what could he do so what could he do it's it got worse when they built the roundabout up there it used to be fine you know we used to have a toll on these Bridges remember them there used to be a toll don't say that yeah but you know I don't think they could do anything I would not be in favor of sending this to any of them to all things are probably the only solution well actually my uh if I had my way we would build a bridge at Sand Key that's what we would do and send it right back over to 60. and then that way they have a loop because many people they get on the south end it's terrible to have to turn around and make your way all the way if you just want to go through and see what's happening um I think that that's I've already asked for Pinellas to to start considering it and as you know it probably takes 20 years to get anything done but it we need to start now and so uh we're we're actually The Big C is putting in hopefully David will who is just like us a Tiny Town uh to represent our type of communities on a Ford Pinellas because if you're already a tourist town and you enjoy this what we're going through and this is what your your idea of making it better is bigger well that's not really the voice for Bel Air Beach so we need to be represented fairly and and I think that's really the only way we're going to make any Headway if if any at all well no disrespect Mike no I I think I think the answer is going to be you chose to live on a resorted beach Island yeah but I also also you know from day one I've always had you lose 100 of the races that you don't run absolutely I mean maybe we just try I mean hey give it a shot whenever I complained at forward Pinellas and it's you know explain the The Dilemma that we face every weekend I was quickly corrected by the uh the mayor of uh Dunedin uh she said do you receive pennies for Pinellas money and I went yes and then I I because I didn't have any numbers I wasn't armed with numbers I was just complaining about the traffic I came home had a brief conversation with Kyle about it and I think it's 600 bucks a day that that's what we get for all of this um aggravation aggravation so um with David with mayor will if he is uh brought in by Pinellas County uh then uh he'll be able to speak because I have on Arsenal pictures every time I'm caught out there whenever I'm on the boat anytime that I see traffic I'm taking pictures like crazy and uh and I don't think they understand what we're really going through Catch-22 is we don't have a state income tax okay so we rely on the tourists so but the tourism money goes through the bed tax which goes to the city yeah the city regardless of let me tell you um Tennessee doesn't have state income tax either um but you know what um if you live somewhere away from those areas then you know it's just where I guess it's where we live but essential and a lot of it is I mean they're beachgoers they're not all Hotel attenders so you know I mean you can just just as you said Sand Key Park is busy go past the beach and Clearwater Beach and the chairs are back to back to back to back I mean you can't I don't know how you even walk to the beach but in fact my original suggestion road work dead end sign come take our signs yeah yeah another suggestion that's that's being uh talked about right now is is limiting the amount of cars that are allowed to go to Clearwater Beach uh building massive parking lots on the mainland side and making everybody park there and forcing them to come over on a ferry or a bus or something else but they're actually doing that now with free beach bussing you ever see that you go down Edgewater Drive and that it says Park here free Transportation yeah it's the problem is is most people want to make it all the way to the end and have their car right there until it's mandated uh it's I don't think it'll ever take hold unless it's something cool like a Gondolier or something like that that people want to make the journey on that's right yeah yeah they're not gonna I mean they do have the ferry that goes over but they have so much stuff to take with you to the beach all right so we've got this in front of us uh would anyone like to uh uh sign this want me to sign it and send it on or uh as is do we want to make any edits or do we just want to right yeah I mean I pray somebody brought it up some probably just hold off on this can we see if there's an association and I uh I'm actually uh meeting uh with uh Renee flowers tomorrow and uh Bill Queen uh down in North Readington Beach so I will ask him because he uh knows quite a bit more about hotels than I did you ever notice when we when my wife and I go out to dinner we don't even go into Clearwater anywhere this time of year we go south and I swear to you the traffic is a lot better from Indian Shores down it is Treasure Island even even Saint Pete but it's also uh four lanes no yes four lanes with turn Lanes well that's true Gulf Boulevard is not a it's not our road it's a county road I mean it does that make a difference in what we you know how we deal with this well we're not we're not going ahead and sending it now is that correct no okay well maybe she just hit the uh mail on the head can we go after the county for additional funding I I I I don't know well you see we don't contribute because we don't have the bed tax we're not charging a bad tax if we are it's very little uh because because we're not a this is not a hotel industry Community but as she noted it's a county road which I brought up before and they're using the county road to go through Bel Air Beach Bel Air Shores is bellar's Bella sure should be on in this fight with us is what because all their driveways open right up on it absolutely I don't think that they're going to join us on anything you had you had commissioner Bloom when they put that um double line it saying it took him 20 minutes to get out of his driveway the one day you know so I don't think he's happy with it well um I'm not really sure what what the good answer is other than to just keep making waves and making noise I think that that's the only all the power that we have at this time um and there are there are other ways that you can complain or or get things done such as demanding that you build garages over there and make people use them you know there's it's just going to take time eventually they're going to hit a saturation point I will say this that a resident I won't mention his name uh brought it to my attention that he believes that um that the city of Clearwater is uh violating Florida law by what they're doing and I uh can't back that up and uh I'm saying it on the record though by basically uh putting in too many allowing too many people in too small of an area and not having the infrastructure to uh to support it and that includes the roads so they're they're actually creating a safety hazard and they are yeah but okay but how do you undo it you know once it's built how do you what do you do then once you have a permanent the CEO you're not getting anything from those hotels all right so let's move on to uh item number six that's kind of an easy one that's discussion to evaluate the city council representation to the Pinellas County flood risk and mitigation public information working group affectionately known as the frmpiwg the front wig um yeah what I found is read through all the details there was a little listing in there that had two members from City of Bellaire Beach that were appointed to this one is Kyle's city manager but the other one was Mark Bean and what I'm recommending I probably got two people here that I'd love to recommend for the position Marv Bean former council is recommend that he be removed and replaced with your you know councilman Banker or councilman Roberts I mean you guys are on top of the flood stuff and have a representative there that works on hurricanes and floods and I'm glad you brought this up because this is like a thorn and I was going to write the Rick Scott's guy today because he hasn't responded back and I know I'm part of the government now I never see the government resolve any problems teach your own dog food I like that one but when the when the legislation had that session last year the result of insurance problem they made it even worse so now citizens is the only one will write flood insurance in this area you can now go and get another private insurance that'll write home and flawed or not hone and win those costs are anywhere from twenty to forty thousand dollars a year that's not including flood okay so citizens now has a half a trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities last not last year 2021 there was 161 thousand fraudulent roof claims I don't think anyone went to prison over here though right so all the all the state legislation did was saying okay we're going to modify a lot of the lawsuits and everything like that that the people will get the money instead of attorneys but the problem is I'm getting calls from all over about I can't afford my flood insurance I can't afford my winning insurance I can't afford my homeowner insurance I just got a call today my homans my homeowners insurance doubled okay no one wants to write here um this is a mess this is this is going to draw this is going to take our property values and plummet them because our homeowners insurance if you haven't thank God my home is paid for but if you have to have a homeowner's insurance win insurance and flood insurance you're talking at least 20 some thousand dollars a year just just insure your house now and that is a lot of money now representative Deerfield she's working on this the seglia has not returned one call you won't and you won't yeah but no he doesn't care I mean yeah but she's very concerned about it but we don't have any private insurers in this in this state anymore and they're just all fleeing and it's and it's not because I think it's all because of fraud it's these insurance adjusters are just killing us it's uh it's it's because of uh it's because uh court cases Court battles I believe I believe that's that's part of the problem these drones they go down these neighborhoods hey you got a shingle Mission you want a new roof thirty thousand dollars later you get a new roof and then boom you know we're 20 out for a 20 repair yeah the uh I'm glad you brought it up yeah but between the storms and frivolous lawsuits I think that that is uh I know that they're trying to address it I've heard Rumblings of it uh the Florida chamber I went to one of their meetings and they were talking about it and that was supposed to be on Rick Scott's radar he had a meeting with FEMA I think it was November and he said you know my constituents are primarily retirees and fixed incomes and it's true he says now you're giving them a choice you want to eat or you want to insure your house you know and it's a hell of a risk and this 2.0 which was supposed to help us it took the grandfathering out of a lot of the Home Center um like your house you know what I'm saying that are four feet five feet above sea level um but you're still supposed to get these 20 discounts if you look at the 2.0 depending on how high your house is above sea level you probably know better than anybody like two feet three feet for it it all goes by a percentage no one wants to give you the discount well they and they also aren't really uh uh forthcoming with the formula yeah to even figure out how they how they calculate all that I think I think really the the end game is to run us all out of town so that they can have more businesses and I I think that you just look at the trend of what's happening in the legislature look at what's happening with FEMA uh it it seems like we're just a Target no matter what I bore my house there nine years ago was under that big Earth's flood and um it was thirty thousand dollars that went short it would be gentrified and um the realtor says well what we would like to do is wipe out houses like yours and build up you know Condominiums six plexes eight plexes or whatever well I don't uh I don't getting back on on track here I don't have a problem with uh either of you guys but wait I'm in Vegas college so you attend those meetings Kyle yes um there's about three per year um we started the County's Public Information Program during our verification cycle for CRS because we needed to make up some points that they were no longer providing that we probably most cities shouldn't have got anyway so we joined the group um wish it you know earned us some CRS points but and during the time um uh Marv volunteered you know to be the stakeholder um for the group um the requirement is you have to have 50 percent ratio so if you have one staff member you gotta have one stakeholder um since we only have six staff members um I think it's best to have one-on-one rather than having two and two because then you know it's just harder to meet that requirement or you just would have to that's during the meeting so if you did have two and two if one person couldn't make it on one side you know we'd have to have someone less I can have two staff members you could have two staff members but you always need two stakeholders for that meeting okay they just got to maintain the ratio um it's explained in the um the report the annual report that we presented in the last council meeting but there's about three meetings per year um they're usually uh I want to say Fridays at 12 30. it's been the trend um and and Marv um you know you can remotely log into them so if you just have a zoom connection you don't have to be in the same room as me um Marv tends to come in but you could zoom in as well and he's been on it for about two years and what I was telling members able is I don't I don't think you'd have any issue with subbing out you know he was kind of doing it as a favor to the city it doesn't matter to me yeah I mean if he's enjoying enjoying doing it does he like to do it whatever he's doing yeah but you know he's he's just involved he'll come around and do all this thing I mean I've never that's why I read well he probably would have reacted with it though I mean yeah um but you know what this is this is public Outreach so the idea of the group is to get everybody all the municipalities I believe it's 26 in the county with the county to be on the same page of the messaging right that we provide um and like I said being part of the group um gives us points for what the county already does so that helps us from some of the things they already invest money into and getting information out and then we do our we you know we have a um a spreadsheet that you know we say this is what we're doing in our community um and we can always opt to do more as different ideas come about in the group and the IDE and the thing is that you know the messaging is all the same so we're not just creating our own message and giving it to our residents and something different in the town over so Marv has been attending all the meetings yes okay okay really I have a problem with with letting him stay unless uh the council objects if he's doing the job unless you prefer to have one of the council members uh represent us instead the reason I put this forward is by having a council member work at they're seeing the numbers I mean tonight we've already discussed the diesel generator potential flood planning Mars not at our meetings he's not a participant in our work sessions or our Council sessions um and he's done his work as a city councilman appreciate it but he doesn't regularly report if he's had his chance for two years to come back and go hey here's we got some problems that's why I recommend I mean YouTube tonight we're just you laid out the case here's why we have to go forward you know the flood planning the prevention the streets um and because you see the budget you're an active participant of the entire process and the other problem with citizens where I forgot to mention is the new caveat is if you're going to take citizens win you have to mirror your flood policy to that policy so you so they've taken the whole free market Enterprise out of the whole system saying hey I only want to insure my house for a higher thousand dollars nope you've been in short for 200 you know and the the final point I bring up is when they speak up they have their own thoughts those thoughts should be frankly those are the elected Community the people that see the day-to-day and understand why we made these decisions so they make a educated approach to these members and a strong um case for supporting our community here's why yeah that's why I keep coming back to you know the council members Mike I I know preaching the choir because like I said it's just going to kill everything yeah so YouTube guys have my strongest support whoever wants to do it you know if we do decide to go this way vice mayor Shirley are either of you interested in taking the position from Marv I don't know that much about it currently I could look into it a little bit I think I just want to be cautious that whenever we have residents involved that aren't elected officials I like to keep them involved you know that's always my concern so so that's the only reason I'm asking because it as you call them a stakeholder they are stakeholders in every decision we make so it's impo it's important in my eyes if we have people volunteering stepping up to keep them in those positions but I don't I have this I don't know anything about Marv's feeling on staying on and how much you would you know he would come report to us or is he doesn't think Kyle's doing that I don't know without having that conversation with Mark well I would like to change the requirement of the uh representation that whoever it is it represents us they come into the following meeting or the council meeting at following and give us a report and if and if they can't if they can't appear personally then I would like a written report or I think that that's the least that that person can do so uh if it's okay with a council would you mind is is it okay to reach out to uh Marv and see if he's willing to do that or if he doesn't want to do it anymore or would the council just rather uh send Mr Banker someday we also could try I mean just for the time being because you know I can get Aaron our community services um administrator to fulfill the other role and then let's get a council member involved in the meetings and you know just for the next couple or so and then see how we feel about it so that you have firsthand and uh Mr bankert I would encourage you to reach out to Mr Beam and just have a conversation with him let him know your feelings and uh it seems like you have a quite a bit of insight on this and uh you may have information that he doesn't so probably not a not a bad idea for the two of you to work together and and he may decide that you're the better candidate when's the next meeting um I will send that to you I mean I think our last one was about yeah yeah I think the last one was in January so it sounds right surfing season finally okay all right any other discussion on this topic before we move on to General business oh all right we're actually doing pretty good tonight yeah um item seven General business um I'm going to bring this one up uh and I'm going to ask Mr Mora to uh Aid me in this one uh so um H the house bill 37 is coming up for a vote very soon uh it was called something else in the Senate but uh I don't have the numbers in front of me but uh it's concerning financial reporting or financial disclosure of elected officials uh is everyone here familiar with what's going on uh Mr Moore are you prepared to kind of give us a quick summary uh the quickest summary that I can give you is my understanding of where Hospital 37 in its Senate Bill corollary are they've gone through all their committees in the respective Chambers they are on the House and Senate floor respectively to be voted on by the full Chambers what these do is change your obligations as elected officials in a municipal jurisdiction from filing what is a what you may know already as a form One Financial disclosure form one disclosures are very um 30 000 feet view of what are your assets and obligations uh a form six is comparatively granular it requires you to disclose assets in excess of a thousand dollars liabilities in excess of a thousand dollars shareholding interest in various companies and llc's it is a very detailed Financial disclosure that is ultimately a record at the state um the competing narratives as I've said many times before in my job it's just storytelling the competing narratives are we need this enhanced level of transparency and um to to assure and protect against special interests and and Corruption or any other number of things and other members of the state already already fill out a form six the counter Narrative of course is this is going to have a tremendous chilling effect on people going into service and local government you're already subjected to an extensive level of scrutiny criticism cheering this will not help and uh other you know there's already been I've talked to some or heard tell I should say of some public officials who've said if this passes them out this isn't what I signed up for um I that doesn't surprise me I will tell you with the current form ones I've had people get elected to like a Planning and Zoning Board figure out three or four weeks later that they have to fill out a form one which again is not that granular and say that's not what I just thought I was passing on variances I want no part of this and walk away uh form six for our for our city commissions council's um aldermen whatever you wish to call them is is going to present yet another challenge in the landscape of local government I'd mentioned at our last meeting that I had gone to the Big C um spoke on different issues and I was quoted as saying that this legislative session has the potential to be calamitous for local governments I stand by that statement I think this is an example of is is one example of that I'm happy to speak to other things mayor but that would be the the cliff nose version while we're while we're here I'm looking to see right now where they stand yeah it's on first reading in the house and um it's been added to the second reading calendar as of April 12th the related bill is Senate Bill 774 Senate Bill 774 um past this I believe it passed the full Senate on April 12th by a vote of 35 in favor and five opposed and is in messages to the house basically they're just waiting for the House vote on the governor's signature and they and as I've said in the past your your challenge this particular session is you've got one party with a super majority your Governor's in the same party if leadership decides something's moving something's moving this is moving and uh whenever it was discussed on the senate floor and they had a slight debate and then uh Senator Hooper he did an amendment to make it to where the ethics commission had to also do the the same thing they had they would have to switch to doing the same form as we would uh and uh but that was it there was uh tell us a company Amendment but it doesn't change anything for you I said it's a misery loves company Amendment but it doesn't change yeah exactly exactly um uh is that going to be going into effect in 2024 I'm going to read you the letter that the mayor's Council of Pinellas County drafted and uh and all the Mayors all the uh members uh uh are on the ladder but I'm just going to read it to you to put it in a perspective as to where we really are and where it's moving forward so just bear with me here uh this is dated April 14 2023 it was uh it was mailed uh to let me find it here see if it's got the no it's it's in the the actual open email that shows who it was mailed to so I'll say I'll tell you that in a minute dear representative on behalf of the mayor's Council of Pinellas County we write today to discuss HB 37 relating to financial disclosures for local officers has drafted the bill would require all elected members of Municipal governing bodies to annually file full disclosure of financial interest form six rather than the limited Financial disclosure form one they are required to file under current law the bill imposes these requirements with no consideration of annual budget size or spending Authority as you may know SB 774 has passed the Senate Wednesday April 12th we are very concerned about this legislation local elected officials and their families live and work right next door to their City's residents and are especially sensitive to people who are their friends and neighbors having access to every intimate detail of their finances this extended disclosure may cause otherwise excellent new candidates to decide not to seek office knowing that all the details of the finances are public record City elected officials are already fully accountable through form one which does not require or which does require details on the source of all assets in addition these officials are fully transparent during each stage of the legislative process by virtue of being subject to the Florida Sunshine Law precluding private conversations between members and mandating open meetings finally local officials did not run for office with expectations of being required to submit this expansive financial information at the very least Municipal officials should be able to finish their current term without the legislation changing the rules midterm then after careful consideration municipal candidates can decide if they want to continue serving in municipal office with a new form six requirements we appreciate the opportunity to speak to the legislation please contact me or any member of the mayor's Council of Pinellas County this was sent to our five area representatives and uh we're waiting for an answer but I think it's going to fall on deaf here it sounds like you've already accepted that it's going to get paid well I think you more or less it's going to get past an attorney is forever a cynic but yes um I I think it at this stage all indications are there's no reason to believe it's dying on the floor of the house that's or that the governor is going to veto this yet I mean the the Democratic process is what it is and if the elected officials of the at the local level of the state um continue to make it known at the very least to their to their Senate and certainly to their governor that this is not what they want maybe they're responsive to that um The Stance of the current um legislative session is not one that is particularly concerned with the concerns of local government officials so I I'm not uh uh going to call out anyone and make them reveal what their uh what their decision would be if this bill passes but um I suspect that there will be many people throughout the state that will resign because of this I also further expect that once that their term is uh that they won't run again because of this and I also believe firmly believe that fewer people will actually run for uh for election uh that have never ran before because of this and and I think that's that's really the goal is to again put the squeeze on us to where it's harder and harder to fill these seats so going back to a prior conversation we had about our term limits and the way that our terms run and possibly uh we may even should consider looking into uh we're we're one of the smallest communities up and down the beach and we have more council members than anyone else does uh everyone else is five I I yeah I understand that there was a reason why it was done the way that we did it but the uh the number of council members that we have is in even divided up into certain territories or areas or anything like that it's just we have seven council members and my fear is is that if this passes we may struggle to even fill those seven seats uh and and God only knows what's going to happen with our boards uh because if they're subject to the same regulations who's going to want to do that and and there's no I mean uh vice mayor Shirley you run a business it's going to cost you money to to gather this data and submit it every year and I will do it for other reasons right you know everything's own and LLC I don't well not only that but I don't need that information on the street and the problem is is at this point we don't even have time to like change our form of government to really think about how do you tackle this problem I mean if it passes we have from now to the end of the year that's right to reorganize the city to reorganize and I mean that this goes into a full Charter change yeah not only that but if they have their way and they're working on it right now to where we would have to do impact studies to change our ordinances I mean whatever we're going to do we're going to have to move on it quickly if we plan to make any changes to the way that we um govern Beller Beach because they're I I think that they're it's going to have a crippling effect on us whenever you have a community of what is it 1800 people you know it doesn't look doesn't look good for us so what do you think the goal is to get us into the county and just eliminate our city completely I think that um so the county makes more money I mean I'm sitting here going I'm trying I'm in the county already taxed that the city gets no tax dollars compared to what the county is getting from us I don't know what the goal is because I can't speak to the motives of people and as I've advised you in the past I've tried to advise and get strongly against people's motives what I will tell you is what is the potential collateral effect of this absolutely if you take a small community and you say we're going to preempt your zoning as you've known it unless you had it in place before 2011. the short-term rental references we're fully they have fully preempted the field on um home-based business regulation you don't have the ability to regulate home-based businesses that was preempted in a prior session they amend um statutes like the bird Harris act making it easier to file claims based on a diminution in your property value um so if you claim oh well now the government's regulated this but now I should be paid for this and in the current session where you have a Senate Bill 170 in house bill it's corollary House Bill 1515 which not only have requires us to potentially have an economic impact statement every time we adopt an ordinance but also includes language that if we adopt an ordinance and it is challenged as being preempted or frivolous that we have to stop enforcing our ordinance during dependency of those proceedings and if we lose we have to pay attorneys fees so when you talk about like the fire ordinance for example and I'm just using it as an example they have not threatened anything of the sort it's been collaborative dialogue but if a party says oh you have this ordinance I'm challenging it it's been preempted or it is unlawful um we can't enforce it if we lose we pay attorneys fees and then if we go to amend it at any time after October 1st if this um by the way Senate Bill 170 that I'm talking about has passed the Senate and is waiting on the house um if that passes then we're going to also have to do an economic impact statement based on our two staff members who have what competencies uh to do this on every version of an ordinance um the net effect is you see you've already you folks have seen it and I've heard it in other communities we don't have neighborhoods we have streets um our neighbors are just our neighborhoods are just hoods because there's no neighbors anymore all you know all those sorts of speech you're left with in a small community like this a small group of people trying to keep a city together and what used to be your public resources are now amenities to a tourist District um and I don't mean tourism I mean like a special district like what you've heard Reedy Creek is and the like the most dystopian version of this since you ask is you have the last few hundred residents fighting for what their city is and the legislature saying there's no point to you existing up and down these beaches having 12 cities we could make you the West Central tourist District [Music] um because we are kind of divided up into areas and and just you know demographic uh uh not demographic but Geographic locations so you've got you've got a southern location you've got an island over here you've got the North Area over here you've got the condos uh the condos already have a homeowners association or a condo association are they under the same are is there's a whole legal regime for condo associations and homeowners associations whether they're facing the same level of attack less so um than cities and because you're government and all government is bad government all government is big government big government is bad right that's the Axiom here um if DC tells Tallahassee what to do Tallahassee is never happy tallahassee's happy to tell you what to do um but um if all a condo association is not big government so those are private property owners agreeing to subordinate the proper private property rights there's a little bit more flexibility but there have been some more recent legislative changes to limit what they do like around short-term rentals and the like and say well if you had this sure if you're going to make it new then you need this you know super majority or whatever to approve those kinds of changes so we are seeing this General change towards we just want to be the economic engine without necessarily looking euclidean zoning the zoning as we've historically known it is at best eroding at worst long since gone and we just haven't realized that cultural moment yet surprising conversation okay so 22nd what the that whole neighborhood has an association that's been all but a bandit but it's out there could they respool that Association and have and protect their rights for a while I I can't speak to that only because honestly I don't I don't deal in homeowners association Condo Association law it is its own chapter in the Florida Statutes and I'm also not going to give private property owners legal advice um without pay uh but the the you know what people or what people live in what people can do and what people are willing to do is also different because the reality is anytime you form a homeowners association or anything like what you're willing what you are saying is if my property rights are to use the legal analogy a bundle of sticks I'm willing to give away some of the sticks in that bundle most people are not willing when they realize that's going to be an encumbrance on my ability to sell that's going to be an encumbrance on across the street they can do that but because I joined this Association we can't and now my house isn't as valuable and it's only as valuable as how many people are willing to join it um which is another challenge because you see with Beach easements and other issues it's 100 compliance is a challenge and I'm not opining on the wisdom of that just the reality you know the one thing I will say about that is that I would uh I would stand behind the fact that the majority of our original code was based upon HOA right and and what they did was they said all right we're forming Bellaire beach now and and they kind of just took the original HOA code and kind of massaged it and turned it into something that uh that's why we have no parking in the street that's why we have there's there's many things that what's that 90-day rentals uh I don't know about the 90-day rental uh part of it but uh but there were things when we did the first review of the code that included like made quarters and how those could be occupied and just some real unique things that were time stamped sort of you know that were taken out of the code so it's it's sad because everyone here volunteers their time I mean all these other boards we have they come here they volunteer time as it goes back to that old saying no good deed goes unpunished I mean um I mean I I did this because I love this city I mean my privilege to live here I thank God I live here but I mean I'm retired too much so it's not going to affect me too much but like I said like when she says I'm not going to do this I'm not going to feel this I might not and you might not reveal it I mean you guys are a lot younger business in line we have a choice what we're saying is you know it sounds like you know also you know the our citizens advisory committee I can guarantee you the people that sit on that will not that will affect everybody right I'm looking at them I'm trying to get to the language right now my recollection of the language is it's the commission and not the subordinate boards um but I'm I'm not Square on that um that's what uh the the representative from the Florida League said he was looking it up as we were we were talking about it and he said that the uh the the volunteer boards would not it was strictly elected because at one point city managers and that fell out of the draft um on the way yeah um so the boards or not you're saying I think the boards are not but they're still form one not Pharmacy it's great to have our Parks director have to fill out and but I think that um Patty and uh now do you do you do a form now at all you do a one I think you would have to go to the form six also I think the city staff is uh required to do it also that's ridiculous who really pushes how long does that take how much work like when I was campaigning and I think I hired this wonderful young lady who was I was working with and she was giving me forms to fill out and all that kind of neat stuff was that a form one somewhere along the way no your campaign stuff's totally separate from this but it would take more time or would I have to hire somebody to do that depends on how many of them so there's another thing to think about which is all right uh obviously everyone's going to be inconvenienced for doing this um it may be necessary to actually do a very minor Pace to offset the extra cost and uh and a hundred thousand Royal no I don't even think so maybe a ten dollars or something but uh something something ceremonial just to show that hey we're uh and I'm not saying do this for me what I'm saying is maybe on the next term we look into making that part of the compensation for being on the council I've suggested that before and you know and I said not not I'm not speaking for myself I'm just speaking for future and I got shot down so I I would be in support of that we're in a different place now yeah I think I would as well and I would even donate whatever the number is I don't even want it so I would be like Donald Trump well it was going to be 100 Grand generator done okay but I mean I agree I think that would help future you know people might well the other beach towns do they have I mean the other beach towns that yeah most of them do get paid every council member I've met has yeah we're the only city that I've met so far that doesn't work when I when I got on couch so I called and they were saying well what's your income I said not they said what yeah they kept what you go to the league of city meetings are you sure well whenever we say we're not here to make money we're not here to make sure we've got to do that full disclosure to make sure you're not making money okay I got a little general business when you're done okay so um we've definitely have some things that we need to look at and uh obviously if uh if we decide to move forward I maybe we we keep talking about this a little bit every time we have work session uh just for updates and also to uh kind of figure out what direction this Council would like to to go uh because it may be time for some changes for uh uh Bellaire Beach do you want to just add so maybe some of the new council members don't understand what a charter review and and Tails and that it has to go to vote in front of the citizens and they're true yeah it's not something we can just review and change well there's some things we can change we're we have the freedom to actually uh change the uh the pay I believe we can do that without a charter change uh but as far as the number of council members uh the length of terms uh when the elections occur all of that what it has to go up uh to a general election and uh be approved by the citizens hey we have to go into the next cycle to pay I think we actually have the freedom to do it anytime we want to and make it active immediately as far as um I believe my recollection on the statute is the pay would have to apply at the beginning of the next cycle under chapter 112 the ethics actually you can vote on it but it can't be effective immediately it can be effective beginning a specified time as to your Charter amendments any Charter Amendment including the ones you folks have been discussing um there are limitations the charter amendment is approved by your electorate Charter amendment requires ballot language that can be no more than I think it's 74 words or 75 Words which finessing that is always a joy um I have to look at your we haven't had a discussion about any Charter amendments Beyond maybe a review commission absent language in your Charter you folks are free to suggest a charter you don't need a charter review commission to propose a charter Amendment you can top down just say we want our Charter Amendment on the next thing that looks like this if you decide it's important enough for your community under statute again I haven't looked at what your code says if there's any special requirements on you and by way of example in most communities your Charter officer works at your pleasure you determinate me at any time in your code there's a very special process step forward for a future remaining the manager so I need to make sure that when we're talking about and that's just my way of how Charters work differently we all love you Kyle um but that's a way of a by way of example on how things can be different yeah and it because it's not been that long since we did change the charter it would it we would have to work very hard to convince the community that uh of why why this was happening right now there's no Witnesses and no one's unless there's someone watching at home no one knows anything about what we're talking about and uh it's going to be we're going to have to work very hard all of us if we decide to do something like this but I really I think it's gonna have to happen just because just because of what uh our buddies up in Tallahassee are doing to us well and and you know to the extent some of you are frustrated by this my only advice to you because I've had elected officials say what can we do about this what can we do about that is the Democratic process if these if if your buddies are no longer your buddies then make that known of ballot boxes and I'm not advocating any one result I'm saying make your own individual decisions as you go through life it's hard because the discussions that we're having here very much affect you they very much affect your residence but that's not what's going to be covered on Instagram it's not what's gonna be covered on Fox News can be covered on CNN I don't care your source of news there's enough controversy in this world and in the state especially in this session you know concealed carry um you know heartbeat bills or life you know abortion bills whatever you want to call them those are going to get attention Financial form disclosures are very very hard to get people to care about and it doesn't affect them it just affects like seven people in their Old City um in theory uh and so understand that there is a lot going on the session and it's it is hard and I sympathize with your concerns and say how do we reach them about Senate Bill 74 714 on short-term rentals and house and and 170 on attorneys fees and and impact statements that stuff's not going to make it's not going to sell papers or get clicks um and it is hard from a messaging standpoint that doesn't make the charge any less important but I sympathize with your frustrations I think a lot of citizens like to see it you know maybe let's disclose the guides you know well right because the narrative is just like what's wrong with transparency what are you trying to hide Frank yeah I agree with you 100 and I I I don't think it's going to get attraction and go the other way and whenever I I contacted the siegly about that he said it's about transparency and I you know I would like to see a big movement uh of the Sunshine Law yeah if it's if you're talking about transparency well let's be transparent and you do the same thing that we have to do which is you can't meet on the golf course and talk business you know you have to do it in public meetings just like the rest of us and they have us so concerned that we don't socialize we don't you know like it's like you just don't want to be accused of anything so it's it's really a bad yeah okay okay so uh we'll we'll discuss this more I'm gonna uh I'm gonna jot all this down and uh and then I'll send it to Kyle and he can massage it a little bit and send it out to everyone to have something to think about uh you okay with that okay uh Mike Sable yeah I do have one item um this is kind of a personal thing you've noticed my last name starts with a z and what comes with that over 63 years you get a little testy because you're always put last for example up here the next is the powers in the mirror but you start out there and there the farthest away from the power there's a reason why we took Jody Shirley mooter from red seat to the seat next to the mayor now I understand that but I don't understand and frankly I'm kind of really disrespected right out there we have the line of councilman and behind the door is my picture I'm not happy about that take a look you open that door who I fought a hard-fought election you were number one I think you're number two told I mean I was number three I mean accused of everything yet I'm put behind the door firstly I'm just asking if this is you can we do the following just take those same pictures and just move them to the center area over here so nobody's behind a door like I am never even noticed that that's interesting I'm very proud of my name so this one frankly I have liked that because I got the extra chair of my crap but can we just out there just move that over to the center area I'm not going to ask the council to decide on where the pictures need to go but I will ask the city manager to appreciate that and and solve this problem okay and if it's easy just to shift mine do that that's fine no no no you're there I look out you're the only person I see so I like this perfect location right through that anything else anyone would like to add in general business you know Mike killed my uh General Business Center number six with him I was gonna bring all that up okay last time uh I think um Washburn that's just gonna come on come over here we still working on that yes I was going to ask you after the meeting at something Wednesday time Wednesday hopefully make it Wednesday yes okay I sent you the invite okay but Wednesday of this week yes tomorrow like what time um time is excuse me uh I will add also I just received a text from someone that is watching so someone thank you one o'clock so uh anyway um I guess that's it for tonight uh 8 30. I appreciate everyone uh hanging in there and uh and uh being open to a lively discussion I'm depressed now if anybody should find themselves feeling optimistic feel free to call me off the bridge exactly you'll wreck that for us all right do I have a motion to adjourn all right all in favor [Applause] I think you just want to get down here"
