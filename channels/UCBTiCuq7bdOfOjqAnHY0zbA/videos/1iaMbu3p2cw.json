    "transcript": "calling the meeting initial meeting of the audit committee combined with the citizens advisory committee and Leslie guitar open council is joining us and we'll call the meeting the Border President we have Leslie lotaro or Goldman Hansen Jody Shirley and Rob rooster is on the line right you hear us Rob yes uh if you speak up a little bit it'd be easier but I have burnt everything so far okay so um I guess first role of business is to select a chair of the audit committee yeah that has to be selected by herb I have a question about that if you look at the resolution that form citizens advisory committee if you look at it further and then you look at this resolution to form the audit committee it says that the advisory committee is the Audi committee but it also says you have to select the chairman for the audit committee I mean you're going to meet his place that's the admin yeah I mean last night there was some discussion I think I had you know with Patty before the meeting and I said this doesn't really seem to make a whole lot of sense that we have to have a another call it an audit committee when we are the audit committee and then collect another chair and we already have a chair of the committee right but the the ordinance says that so we just have to do it because this committee as it is now really only meet a couple times you guys Leslie won't be part of it this is only for the selection of the audit auditor so that's what it's for okay it's a requirement of the statutes now okay and there's there's going to say that the chairman of the audit committee can't be the chairman of this committee or a chairman of the advisory committee well in my simplistic question hey Rob go ahead speak up yeah to to make a moped secretary and vice chairman of the advisory committee be appointed as the same positions in the audit committee yes you are did you just make that motion I'll second it so moved so seconded all in favor aye aye any opposed okay okay that was made by Robert I have a cheat sheet here for uh yeah a couple of minutes now Petty fixed you up okay all right so I'll continue uh the role as chair of the audit committee and so our next uh business item is to review the written proposals that we received for the rich request of the RFP and so we all got those in advance my proposals were from Wells Houser and schatzel and um and I'll make a motion people through the channel okay gotcha all in favor aye aye any opposed and before we get into the discussion of Ramirez either of the application of the responses I needed a little clarification on how the accounting was being handled for the city and tournament outside of the audit process because I I didn't know if we were still farming that out we saw contractors could stand it does that firm part of the subcontract include the preparation of the documents that we furnish to the Auditors and so then to read it yes and once we have the name of that he's not like we used to have Melanie yeah it's the charter officer so he's a subcontractor serving as Treasurer right and preparing on yeah Heather's the one who's here most of the time excuse me someone's on site constantly uh two days a week the market I noticed in the notes that we use QuickBooks for the city to run the finances on and so I guess they'll provide access to people [Music] okay foreign but in the in the actual RFP that we said we had a proposal requirements and the responses we're supposed to follow in order of the proposal requirements and how they presented it um so I don't know you know I or we just have an open discussion yeah so yeah I look it looked like everybody followed the order um the only thing I noticed on the uh whs is that they were supposed to provide emails to their references and there were no emails of those references it was just the whole number of names it also the proposals were supposed to note quote sealed proposal I saw that the salt marsh node seal proposal and the pricing sheet but maybe it was an image yeah it was both were in the city yeah [Music] so so this this thing was sealed when we got both of them okay there were separate envelope they had these uh in there and then they had separate or separate envelope we had to continue talking about my share on us I I have a question before we get into the sharing our thoughts go ahead did we get any uh feedback from any of the references that either one of these bidders provided us did we directly call them no because the first process really is for the audit committee to rank them and then at the ranking if you want that we'll we'll get some feedback that's not a problem I will tell you just so you're aware certain salt marsh has been our auditor for as long as I can remember uh and their their pricing came in it matched with the last 10 years and the wells housers uh satzel it is an auditor has many other cities also and I mean they're a good firm uh actually they were the auditor where I worked in Oldsmar so uh you know I'm familiar with them but you know yeah as we're saying I noted that they had a lot of piercings you know like ballet boxes yeah okay so we we got their references but we haven't reached out to any of the references I understand thank you the other thing I noticed in our general information we didn't talk about the bond issuance I'm not sure if whs has that information the bond issues for the underground and in County but if they're you know we talked about the storm water recruitment you know fees and things like that actually save it costs them to our normal improvements covered with that fee and it's not so we we kind of misstated some things in our in general people think that maybe leaves us over this additional accounts charges hours yeah this year Oh you mean because of the store mark uh they were aware of the three funds basically the marina fund the stormwater find the general fund so they they were all aware of that because uh there were a few questions I mean I think that's kind of ads well if they would have quote last year's audit I would have assumed that they would have killed at least I mean I know that salt marsh is aware of it I'm just saying I don't know comparing Apples to Apples if they weren't they haven't been intimately involved with what's going on with Feller age they know that you know and does that opens up to more costs because maybe it wasn't divulged in general information it's just a cautious everybody get a chance to see um jobs with comments even though he's an advisor or achievement or ultimate yes okay thank you John Hayes our alternate um formerly worked in public and caring um didn't take a look and provided some things foreign Bittinger Janine Bittinger for years and they have gotten us the the what's the highest rating the kafra yeah you know they've been very successful for these years and I don't believe it I know since I've been around I've never had any issue with anything they have ever done I think they are a Statewide firm yeah whereas the other protesting more locally and they've got a great book of clients in the municipal business space government space where we go to firms throughout the state when it comes to you know it's not in the audits they both responded to our Department very well I don't I mean it really boils down to talk to what I'm looking at this they both have great references I mean maybe we can call them and ask more information but I mean both firms have been around for a while both responded appropriately except for the money yeah that's the only thing I see yeah and when you're doing these types of honors has most wanted you all they all have to follow the aicpa standards and they can meet those standards and prove that they examine everything to those levels so it's not like oh I'm going to look at this very carefully they're obligated to meet those with those scenaries so I think we whoever we award this did devotion just simply rewarded to pass the Eco standards it will be held to those things they both provide a peer-reviews that state that they need their standards and exactly I think that Leslie's Point here that gfoa is certificate of achievement for excellence and financial reporting salt marshes let us there last four years well actually salt marsh just took over two years ago or somebody else Davidson and Christine they bought them out and that that was our auditor but the salt marsh is a much larger company than they bought their business out a lot of their employees went went with them you know I will say we we've never had any issues with the audit and getting it to us on time and you know we have a kind of a timeline that they have to put it they've met it thus far except for the finance numbers it looks like three years ago they were 22-5 a year and then the last 10 years they've dropped it to 17.5 but we promote the reduction of these results I don't remember I'd have to go pull the contract but I don't remember it being 22. I I just saw that in uh I pulled up the budget okay and the 1819 year was 22.5 it lined is for the auditor okay so there could have been something that yeah what was going on yeah because I know the last maybe we expected it to go on yeah well like in the budget that that we've given you because I want to try to schedule another meeting for to look over the budget uh I put twenty five thousand dollars in there because I didn't know but once we get there then I'll adjust it accordingly because that was just as a placeholder the budget versus what we pay yeah they're not necessarily the same thing and in salt marsh you know clearly hasn't laid up because they know us right they know they're familiar with the city they're familiar with our accounting balance right I survive a decision here so is it absolutely necessary based on our conversation that we have to score them based on what we're I think it's a good idea to do it because that's what we said we were going to do okay and you know you've got to I think I see where the the conclusion of this conversation is going to go I mean we have somebody who has been with us for a few years and has gotten us this award so like Jody just said they have kind of a leg up and um Price is Right yeah and they I will say salt marsh being a company you know a more I'll call it State company that's why yeah uh I think that's beneficial because you're going to get more opportunity I I you know Wells and Hauser I know them they're they they're they were good Auditors also for this city of Baltimore and they've been with them for well I know at least 25 years and a lot of times auditors they don't even go back out for an RFP they but the console asked me when the contracts were up to do an RP so you know that's what we did I thought we would get a couple more but we really did wait because you put it up to six didn't you yeah and we didn't we had one other firm that asked a few questions but then they opted not to do anything I think it was called Brian if I remember right based on Mr Handsome hands I've said some eyes here I guess the art of scoring is what we need to do and I was just trying to skip a step well to be fair there's a challenge and I assume that location firms get to look at the results and I guess so what'll happen after you do your scoring we'll collect the sheets so on and then you'll make a motion too I love crying at home okay oh is this what is this what we're filling out here no well okay cheap in the back of the book that's where you will make your rank totals and then we'll take those totals and then whatever the number one rank of our score is then you'll need to make a motion to recommend that is so there's five yeah well that's because there's five of you when I asked her to do that so you only need to put one in there and put your name on it so we add them hey Lynn yes a couple of things so specifically for this scoring system my first question do you want me to give you my scores verbally right now with the phone so somebody can record them or if you are having everybody fill out a sheet and turn it in you just want me to fill this thing out and email it back to you uh if you want to just give me your scores I'll I'll write them down on the sheet I have and then we'll go from there okay good and I'm ready to do that my second question was on the scoring itself just so I understand so just for example in the first category qualifications experience expertise the 45 points so we did award up to 45 points to both of the bidders yes is that right yes we don't split those points no it's not like you can give 35 for one and ten for somebody else no okay good thanks okay Rob are you ready with your numbers okay I'm gonna pick you up off the speakerphone okay go ahead okay okay okay okay okay I've got your number so I'll put you back that's right you there Rob yes okay foreign foreign well it is that for your point about not submitting emails and references [Music] foreign thank you I've been in Orlando Joe you've been in Orlando open [Music] I think so I don't think much I did put a Bush Gardens on Friday the kids out there she's got one of those pull chains what poultry pulls you all the way across okay I drive there back three hours each way in a day okay thank you foreign foreign there's only 30 possible points there I got my tools down there for you but only 30. yep you know cost I think and they've told everybody that's it the original Milwaukee forward from downtown Orlando some of that's already booked yeah you know I have some shopping Altamonte Springs so when I go there like you should go through beautiful yeah I know I drive I do the same things my personal physician is over at uh Florida Hospital downtown my wife worked here she was in um graduate medical education residency programs there because they were teaching hospital and I think the head of the surgical education position I tried the economic twice a year so what I've been doing now for about 12 18 months there is okay I make an appointment with him early enough for the day and the same day I make one with my urologist so that I can keep up with my prostate about getting two appointments yeah I get too old to be doing that stuff to think that I used to do that for a living just for a number of years before I went into the office so I'm a manager so often we don't know the first couple years I was retired from the Navy I tried my hand and it didn't work so well so I went to the state and they said well we got money through the uh the VA for uh machines an hour for 20 plus years experience the total score I happen to be a commercial truck driver because I could not Pitch myself going around and fixing copy machines those are the only two things you can get retrained for so I took the CDL there is no amount of money in the world today Amy I can get behind one of those big rigs with all these pardon my friends idiots on the highway and everything they do and the things I saw then were bad right so we've got uh one's totaled it all up with all of us here tonight so the total we saw Forest is 511 before it's the total for UHS is 457 so looks like we're going to recommend salt marsh is the auditor to make that to make it official I make the motion they want one what would you say salsa numbers were 5 11 5 11 okay Wells 457. thank you all right need a second yeah [Music] Okay so we've completed the choice of auditor that will recommend the city council and then they get to make the final decision and so the next item is General business I've given you draft budget it's still in draft I gave it to the city council last night and I'd like to try they're they're going to have a work session on the 21st and I'd like to try to schedule a meeting with the advisory committee before that if we can if you're available to do that and you know I'll just go through it with you and it's explain everything and I don't think it'll take us it's pretty self-explanatory if you look at it wouldn't you say a work session is the 21st yeah foreign I'd like to spend an hour hour and a half and go through it and let you but I want you to take it home look at it and then if you've got questions that as I go through it then I can answer so I guess what I'm asking is are you available next week I don't need to go to that okay got it and I I don't know where Rob's at I am available uh Monday evening or Tuesday evening next week or Friday so 14th 15th or 18th 2014 okay okay is it Monday yeah Flag Day okay so John may be out of town yeah and go through it you know and if you've got questions just these are copies we'll we'll yeah we'll do what 14 facts yeah six o'clock okay Monday yeah okay and uh I'll have Patty email it to you Rob can I also come by and get a hard copy yeah whenever you're back in town you just come or we can get it to you I'll get it to your house if that's fine yeah I'll be back uh Thursday morning so I can come by okay that's fine okay anything in the budget that the only things that that really will stand out in there uh the sheriff is asking for three 3.63 increase uh next year there is a placeholder in there depending on if the governor signs it because there's a needs and allowance this for storm water that the Senate there's a senate built and we don't actually know what the cost but I put a 30 000 placeholder in there the the House and Senate passed a bill in this state legislature if the governor signs it we're going to be required to do a needs analysis on our storm water and infrastructure for 20 years out so it's going to require an engineering firm and you know it's a it's a it's a big cost that you know I don't think a lot of cities have planned for what the state's going to provide funds no no no no no no it's going to be ours can't Elevate I know but but there's a requirement to give the Department of Economic Opportunity a report by next January 20. I think it's 23. if the city not already have something down that line when during the whole world well we we did but not to the elevation that they're asking what what they're asking is uh they're wanting us to do a needs analysis as far as funding how we're going to pay for it uh what the long-term cost is going to be and so it's more detailed and I'm hoping the governor vetoes it because all it is an additional cost to cities I mean Indian Rocks Beach is an example he's expecting it's going to cost his City a hundred thousand dollars you know so they were pretty far down the road yeah so and you know it's just it's another reach a mandate that legislature is put on all cities so it's a new result when you look at these expenses that are new but then I got to think that with all the new transactions in town There's could increase on Revenue are our ad valorem uh increased 6.03 percent which is about I think it's sixty nine thousand dollars that's the increase if we leave the military as it is uh I will tell you that we're not sure when we're going to get it but we're going to get some funding from this American Rescue plan it's not in the budget because I got estimates but they haven't told us and it's going to funnel through the state which typically the state doesn't get it to us as fast as we'd like but I stand in on a webinar yesterday and supposedly after the state gets the money they only have 30 days to give us our portion and it will be in cash uh so means for infrastructure in particular storm water can be used for uh it can be used for sewer it can be used for Revenue we lost which in our city we we lost rental revenue and we lost some parking Revenue but for the most part we didn't lose much because well investors once the beach is open for a month maybe we lost it for a month so you know you could say you know if you want to go that route but I mean I would suggest to the city council that we use that for storm water if the funding was there yeah and they're going to give uh there's a right now they're saying we have until 2024 to spend the money something unique about the money when we do get it there we can put it in the bank and draw interest on it well not much but but you know that when I saw this when I saw this webinar yesterday when I saw this webinar yesterday and it the slide popped up I was like what you're gonna they're gonna give us this cash where in the past what you had to do you had to spend it and then you get it well this is in reverse and uh Our rough number estimate is like 670 000 but I don't know if that's uh factual yet these are just numbers that were thrown out yeah yeah that would move some a lot of stormwater projects to the head of the West yeah on this the storm water thing you mentioned about expectations is is that all engineering costs pretty much that needs analysis would be an independent 20-year yeah most of the costs yeah yeah it's it's it's an engineering operation yeah so he's going to help out a lot of Engineers if he signs it so uh some other things in the budget we we have uh Gulf Boulevard money for the underground and utilities this year we got 256 000 next year we're going to get 676 000 from the county penny for Pinellas money it can only be used for undergrounding utilities on Gulf Boulevard overall we're going to end up with about 2.9 Million uh there is 1.1 million from Dollar Shore that in the past it's we've used it uh and I'm going to approach them about leaving because that's what the agreement says that Bellard Beach could use it but I don't in the current situation I think I need to ask them yes I declare do you have a proposed strategy for what goes next uh well we pretty much got the west side of it done except for a little uh spectral areas which is about sixty thousand dollars which I'll be bringing to the console this year because we have penny three money that is going to expire in September I've got about 60 000 left so I'm going to use it so whatever I can and then the 256 from this year will just roll over because the initial number I got from duke was 5.5 million and the initial number is on our side to finish the east side yeah and the initial number I got from Spectrum to finish the balance in the city is about 190 000. so but I've gone back to do uh and told them I well I'll tell you what I told them I said is this April fools because they told me on April 1st of this number and I said you need to come back with something else because I want it separated and I explained to them that the uh they were encroaching into some neighborhoods that we're not part of the Gulf Boulevard stuff so they've got to clean that up and they charge me for some Crossings which if you look now there's not much Duke left and hopefully by Spectrum told me today the end of this month or yeah they said a month so I'm thinking the end of the month first week of July from first through 12th you won't see any wires going across Gulf Boulevard and then they're going to start the rest of the city so the only wire that for the most part that's left is the cable wire that's going across Gulf Boulevard and that will be Underground so uh and then was that all cable or is it too it's it's cables uh uh Frontier doesn't have anything above the ground anymore so uh and and I had asked them if they did but they don't they told they had a little bit in Bellevue Island Estates and but and I think they had a little bit when we looked at Harrison there's so much so so hard but the goal is to underground the east side and put those because those are the really the transmission lines that are beating both sides of their room so we can get it in the number and put our own conduit in I there's a possibility we will be fine but we'll have to wait and see what that number comes back because based on what's Spectrum told me about 60 percent of the cost is the boring and I think I can do better with going to somebody like you know to burn out like I didn't like the park corner or something and say Hey I want you to run this project tell me what you can do to shoot these conduits down the street there's funds for that American Rescue plan we should probably put the effects it doesn't benefit it's kind of a well it doesn't doesn't offer that at this point and and we'll get more detail once they really figure out how they're going to do it uh I got an email just before I came in here that I've got to give them some numbers so they can calculate our real number so but in either way I think there's some infrastructure benefit that we can get you know if it's storm water and storm water take advantage of it you know so other than that there's three percent increase for the employees not really any major projects other than stormwater project for next year in the budget every year we save money for you know as an example we put money aside for Paving or we put money aside for the beach accesses this year we got 50 000 from the county to to do the Crossovers so it only cost the city half that we've got some money in there for a dock on 7th street because it's deteriorated but at the same time and there's money in there for sea walls and things of that nature but we've our big sea walls we've taken care of already majorly I mean we took care of Harrison we took care of Ben Lyle so now what we've got is the little pocket park sea walls and you know when we do something like a doc project we'll probably do that Seawall at the same time and my device spend more money and tear up something twice so but we'll go over that and I'll just kind of highlight the things and we'll go go through it if you've got any questions write them down or if you've got a question you want answered before then just call me okay so we'll meet the 14th at six o'clock here to review that with any other questions or businesses if anybody wants to discuss in a motion for a German so much all in favor all right any opposed thanks everybody thanks Rob thanks Rob"
