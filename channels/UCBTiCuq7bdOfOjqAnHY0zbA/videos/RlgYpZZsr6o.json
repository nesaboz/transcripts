i think um kudos to both of you for like staying at the water table the whole time and staying at the the t-shirt table the whole time and i ran around like a chicken and thank you to kyle for do because we couldn't have done it without you like you were like the table you mean you did everything in the background so it was great and your kids went on the decorations oh your kids were great they were awesome they had so much fun and they passed out on the water and it was like perfect for them put the decorations away i was like yeah she was so upset that she didn't get a better picture of your children for the magazine for next month whenever they're gonna post it that's why she was like she's like and they might the one that you forward to me may end up in there just because it was better than the one she took so anyway i didn't even take a single picture from there neither i didn't take a picture of anything so i was like pictures did you yeah i didn't see any of them yeah okay which is for records shorts oh i think yeah i took a video too well two videos of like rotating oh nice yeah okay perfect so it was fun it turned out good it did turn out good weather was great everything like there's no weird hiccups no nothing everything was fine couldn't have been happier hi george george hotel present okay so we were just doing a recap we're on item number four a recap of jazz in the park and we were just congratulating ourselves on a job well done and thank you george for all of your help too and i didn't do much you supervised and that's good we needed supervision but you guys did a great job thank you i thought it was great so like you know of course like the next day i was like oh well what could we have done to make it better or what would have i done differently or what you know what i mean like in general what could we i don't think we could have been better prepared i think that um the only things that i thought of the top of my head was it was awesome that my neighbors came and set up that tent over you not only for the shade but just for the fact that people saw where to go you know so that was great and like kyle and so kyle bought us two tents four yeah because if we have six judges we're going to need two tents over the judges and then um we'll talk about that in a minute but i'm going to get the sound speaker oh okay sure and then so and the other thing that i thought of so that was great that they brought that so i said you know for our next event could we have those here and we would continue to use them so he already went and bought them from amazon the big blue tent over where nora was that my neighbor lent us so now we have two for city hall has two that we can use that was important i think because being out of the sun was absolutely cause you were running around delivering her kids right oh the kids were they were squirrels and she was doing a great job of selling stuff we saw a lot of things over seven hundred dollars nice i saw a ton of people walking back steps yeah yeah it was great it's because like we were able to get it because like we were talking about like if people work until like after four they don't they can't get here yeah but you know what i think a lot of it was somebody went up and bought something and came back and other people said where'd you get that yeah if we had signage pointing in the direction of leaving several sides with arrows leading up to where it was yeah it worked out good because the way it was she was never swamped it was like a person like one or two people would go up at a time and then like it was just a nice steady flow it seemed like they had to pass you for the bathroom too so yeah and they had to pass for the bathroom yeah well that's because we wouldn't let them in the bathroom unless they bought something it's a tactic exactly and then the other thing that i thought of was if i would have had more than two hours of sleep the night before i would have thought to put one of us up when the band was on a break to like announce the halloween just one more time in people's ears and then the christmas thing so like of course the next morning i'm sitting at my table at 5 30 going why didn't i do that it just never crossed my mind even when jules was like well can i announce something about bellar living i don't remember it still didn't pop into my head until the next day and she didn't he did it he did it for her um so that was that was really the only two things that i thought of him and we gave away every single logo koozie um it was a perfect amount too yeah everybody had water i would say there was like 120 people there because there were some people there like no i don't need one or like you know yeah i would say that about 120 is when i got up so almost every day yeah i counted twice i never got that high would you get two i encountered at the peak i kept waiting um i was in the 60s high 60s i don't know i definitely was over a hundred and uh it's a seven thirty i must have counted like 645ish yeah well i was in the spot where you put me and i could see pretty much everybody okay so it's like i don't you didn't give me anything i was looking down oh nice [Music] most people were said i already have one or whatever if they went for another water you know but something people might if i can't remember all right and you didn't need to it was fine but did anything pop into anybody else's head for if we do this again next year which i think we should i think maybe the only thing i would do it is maybe a little bit later like november so it's not so sick and hot in the middle of that it was very hot yeah it was hot i mean it was great the shade but the shade was perfect but yeah we're still on the tail end of you know people not rain whether too and the other thing is like we would have been fine with the light until eight but the mosquitoes were the size of parakeets so i am so glad that we ended when we did yes it was like they swarmed oh it was bad so when we were cleaning up and cleaning up the kids were like oh my goodness they're everywhere and they really were their entire legs you know like that just happened so the time was good i just think if we did a little bit later then there would be less bugs daylight savings time the beginning in november yeah beginning so that would affect it'll be dark instead of 7 30 6 30 or earlier so we would just start earlier and end earlier and that would help with bugs and i think that's a good idea and it's kind of nice too it's been so nice yeah and then everyone can go like if they want to go out for dinner or whatever it's still like their whole evening isn't like um i felt bad for like the whole family that showed up like so like what was it 7 30. we were literally pulling out the whole family showed up at 7 30 five thinking it started at 7 30. that ended at 7 30. like they had a little a newborn baby and like a three-year-old and it was like young couple it was i felt bad were they walkers from they walked oh really got mixed up we were fine with parking too yeah i never walked around to the other side but it seemed like it was a split between walkers and drivers we were totally fine did you so was did it look full or it looked like it was probably only about 50 capacity of cars okay a lot of people walked you could see yeah they're bringing their chairs yeah so that was great okay we'll just kind of keep it in the back of your mind because obviously we have more than a year but like i'm pretty much thinking the music was great and like the italian ice was great and everybody that wanted food could bring it and i i know i heard a lot of people going they stayed for a couple hours and said okay we're going to dinner now so it's like you know if they didn't want to pack a whole thing like i brought ever like i was camping out like i didn't need to yeah everything cleaned up really well too there wasn't like anything yeah you'd never know there was anything there okay well perfect so if you think of anything else though just kind of maybe jot it down and bring it up at one of the meetings and we'll just kind of keep a running tally but it was pretty um simple and low-key and it was what we wanted so it was nice to have no drama or no no incidents okay so for our next event coming up the halloween costume parade and contest so i um i have never done one of these before but i've been to them so i'm just gonna kind of maybe run through like how i picture it and then chime in and go no that won't work and then we can also do the same thing that we did that day we moved the tables 10 times we you know what i mean like that kind of thing like we can adjust at the end um and then i typed up some stuff that i'll pass out in just one minute but um the way i see it is that like we kind of do what we did for the jazz and we come in the friday before like 2 30 it'll be an easier setup because we won't have all the deco and stuff on the walls um which we did that the next day but we won't have any of that we'll just put the tables together we actually need four tables for this event so kyle ordered us a fourth tablecloth which is great because we have six judges um and so we have two tables for them and then they'll be under the two tents and then the way i pictured it is we set it up on the helicopter pad and we do it um where so like the judges are kind of um here like the tables are here and here so like their backs are to the street and they're kind of facing this way and the water would be this way so you have the six judges underneath the two tents and then you do like the community table which will also be like our treat bag table our the table where we hand out the numbers and the safety pins as people come up and we kind of like put them together and then then our other table will be on the other side and then that will be like the water table and like we'll have the dog bowls and all that so we're not handing out koozies or anything like that but we will definitely have water and coolers like we did last time so it'll kind of just be boom boom boom boom and then and that's all on the helicopter page yeah it's on this side of the helicopter pad north side the north side of the helicopter pad yeah and then as far as the the contestants i don't know if this will work but this is just kind of the way i envision it because i don't know how many people that will have because it's a circle so it's like say we have um the kids go first or the pests go first it doesn't matter whoever we have the most of will go first but then we'll line them up so it's like along the outer perimeter we'll have so like so here's number one will be to the left of the whatever table it is and then they kind of go around in a circle so then we have our six judges this is because we didn't do best costume scariest costume most creative costume we're just first second and third so all they're getting voted on is um overall best costume first place second place and third place so and this is kind of like i mean help with more than anything if this will work but the way i envisioned it is um so like no person number one contestant number one whether it be a dog or a kid or whatever so we have you know halloween music playing because i found an awesome playlist and i have a big speaker so whether whatever scary cute music it is we turn it on contestant number one comes from the side and they go up in the center of helicopter pad so they can do a little twist or a little turn or a little bow or whatever they want to do where they can dance or they can just walk through and go like this and turn around and walk right back to their place and so it would be contestant number one two three four whether it be a dog or a kid and then the judges will say okay number one they rate them on a scale from one to ten so they can say contestant number one whatever reminds them so they could say a five-year-old girl because all we're gonna ask is their first name and that's it or you know so we can say okay contestant number one susie will go out parade around so they can write susie is a princess and then we rate her costume a number a six or whatever they want to give her and then at the end of it we add up all six judges and whoever has the highest points gets first second and third place what do you do about thai well it's about to happen bound to happen yeah i have that written down with the question mark so i'm hoping because they they number them from one to ten and it's just not like a one two three there won't be a tie because like if someone gives them a six and someone gives them a seven or someone because the the overall number would be the tiebreaker but no i mean so chances are with six different items being voted on it's bound to happen because people tend to vote relatively on the same scales yeah i don't know i'm just saying we gotta have like maybe something thought up oh the gift card's already could you do an example for me on what might fill up for you should write like bumblebee and they're gonna announce their name right so that's the this is the number the first one who walks so it's going to be like an empty stage there's going to be nobody in the center and then an announcer is going to say we're welcoming george to the stage and george is going to walk up you're going to walk up there and you can do a little monster mash yeah and then walk away and then they'll write george dracula uh i rate him a 10. wow i think he's trying to figure out what the boxes are is that what you're trying to find that's yeah okay so first one is george yeah so contestant number one see the one and he will literally have a number one on him with a safety pin and then the first box is named first boxes name or whatever you need to remember by you can write george dracula and then right here you can put you know you got a nine or ten or whatever it is and then this is really just for the very ending so we're gonna no i'm trying to follow these lines across what you really don't need to follow the lines there's only contested number one costume and a rating yeah i mean i can i can make this right and just yeah i can make three problems for you but you're not judging so i mean it won't be confusing to you at the time there's really only three columns i just kind of put squares on the whole excel thing and i didn't i did it five minutes before i got here so you can still win right well because i just make happen yeah i can always make it i can adjust it whatever we need yeah and i can adjust that that's an easy fix it was enough or one clearing or whatever yeah so i mean that's an easy fix but just as far as like okay so one would be george costume dracula and on scale from one to ten i give george a seven and then number two might be susie she's a princess i give her costume a four and then uh all six judges will do the same exact thing for every single kid so like their columns one and two will look the same the only thing that'll be different is number three and then at the end when we're passing out the treat bags to the dogs and the kids like we'll have kyle go and like add up and then he adds up the points so he takes contestant number one george got a seven a six a four a three a two and so overall he got a 47 and then number two got 15 number three gotta and then we do first second and third place based on just overall number does that make sense and that's why i think like it it's only going to be a tie is if everybody gives george a four and then everybody gives susie a four and then everybody gives tommy a four and then no no i get it um how will how do you normally what are the gifts they give a card to purchase already i think it's a lot of people will do it by like audience applause but i think that's brutal for children yeah and i would advise and i would get a backup card an overtime sheet um like maybe the lesser scale or you are i mean something we get back to the judges to make them re-vote on a different scale to hopefully give a difference for that just that okay i see i didn't even think about applauding i would just applaud for everybody yeah i wouldn't do the whole yeah a lot of people will do okay now i had what do you suggest i mean do you tell people not clapping me i would no not on them i mean like on okay it's between you two oh no that's not how we're gonna break a tie oh my gosh no i don't know for anybody no no no no no no i have cash ready we have first second and third and it's the cash is bigger how much is it a hundred seventy five and fifty for first second and third so there is i'm gonna put on my costume and get the guy get that hey and i i bought for the kids too because they like little whatever i got little first place like ribbon second and third for their costumes and a piece of paper to all the judges and they have to make about yeah how many times six yeah hopefully okay but you know our mc is dave gaddis so he can be the type of breaker yeah there you go his vote if like there you go there you go that's perfect so all he'll have to do is vote on the last like i don't know how do you do that dude i wouldn't even announce it i would just if it becomes between a tie between you two you just bring it up to the dj and say you pick well what about this though say if there's a tie for first place yeah oh so he breaks it up to say who would go to second place and then yeah that's great okay that's probably this way okay and then it's an odd number so that works yeah i think so okay so but this is an okay rating system as far as we just need to fix the columns yeah i think if you make a like a bold column for the numbers that way you know people aren't writing six here you know but i want to make kyle work for it wait now where is it yeah no it's gotta get tight um did laura say should come yeah laura's gonna help wendy gaddis is gonna help um pat she was at the last meeting and she's been to the last few beach cleanups she's gonna help so we do definitely have helpers um and then like kyle also got because we really don't have like a anything out there to help to hear so kyle got us a mr microphone a mr microphone do you want to demonstrate yeah um it's for dave but it's also for the music okay are you still doing parade yeah okay and i actually kind of figured out that i was going to want to buy you guys what we could do if the construction is still there because the construction is making me nervous because it's like the parade route is cut off at this moment does that have bluetooth yep so i can connect my phone to that with the um amazon music halloween yeah but um i don't know what to test it with uh over speaking over with the mc i'll just bring a difference i'll bring a different speaker because we don't want the music to be loud should i sing something no this is good right yeah it's good i tested every input on it like it can actually perfect no so that works that's awesome um oh okay so then like so we go through the whole entire thing like one two three and then we do all the kids and then we do all the dogs or whatever we do which way first and then um and then while he's counting we're going to go right into the parade we're not going to give them their treat bags because we don't want them having stuff to carry we just want them to go so initially like we were going to walk right off the helicopter pad in a line go around in our big circle come cut back through the back and come right back to the helicopter pad but now there's construction so if they don't clean up the construction what i was thinking that we would do is you know how these first two streets right here are just dead ends so what we could like still come out we could go down the first street come back out go down the second street come back out and then come back and go right through the parking lot and hopefully the street will be open but it'll just be a lot shorter if we don't and then we can also do it by time like say if the costume thing takes a lot longer than we thought then um where the construction is they literally have roadblocks and the street is torn out they need to repave it there's rocks there now but it's like barricade bob barricades is up yeah richmond in a couple different places so we'll play the parade by ear if if worse comes to worst we'll literally just do a big loop right around waiting for the parade it would be one thing but i know i was kind of because the causeway is always so busy on a saturday morning that they would see it from you know what i mean like just i'd be nervous with sending kids out too much time on the street yeah see that's the other thing there's no sidewalks on those streets there's only on those dead-end streets but if we if you're walking through this parking lot and down past the tennis courts and down to the end bag if it's too long a lot of them might not want to do it okay it keep it in the parking lot yeah you're gonna have you're gonna have parents with like you know one-year-olds dressed up oh yeah yeah so if they were little i'd assume that the parents would be walking the parade with them the dogs have to be walked in the parade with the parents um how many people do we have last time huh the last one i think we're in like total registration i think about 27 i want to say that's pretty good yeah that's impressive has anybody else called probably i mean with all the adults there i would say it was probably like 50 or 60 people wow that's good what did you say i was what it was no because the sign will be up but he bought signs yeah i mean i don't know what cycle yeah oh the big series 56 we don't know what we get this time this is closer to them so we didn't order a big sign for here because that's right that's like getting more people involved right so well we just went into it's not doing again i don't know we have those i don't know how it's going to play and then we didn't order the big banner i think it's going to be that smaller beyond the flashing time it always says like the neon that's going to be that was the chocolate tree that's why i really like it yeah like two weeks he said like next week they like it it's already at one point yeah they've been out there because that was for the judging yeah so it was like the prayer was by the way before right it was just like okay no it's just long enough okay all right are we good yeah okay so yeah we'll just stay in the parking lot then we don't have to worry about the construction and then um nor just ask about signage so hopefully this new electronic sign in front of city hall that they've been working on for a while will be up and it'll be on there and then kyle ordered six of those yard signs kind of like we did for jazz that'll be kind of put everywhere um that say halloween you know the information on it with pumpkin and a little kid on the top yeah they came out good so can we get those up a little earlier what do you what do you want this to tell me two weeks out maybe two weeks exactly yeah that would be nice so the friday before two weeks so 15 days yeah is that okay yeah okay next week right yeah yeah um we'll do that oh okay so question in regards to that day do we want to wear halloween costumes do we want to ask the judges and the mc to wear halloween costumes do we just want to wear black shorts and a white shirt and have our little name tags with i have a wing sticker on it that i bought like you know i think costumes would be nice just because that's kind of the whole thing i know you're not going to be here but like i wonder she's got to work what do you think george what do you want to be for halloween i'm scared without a costume um i think costumes are fun i think costumes are fun too and i think i've got at least half the judges already like in agreement to wear so i've just gotta charge those costumes yeah i think it would be kind of fun if like the people involved maybe city employees you can do required mandatory do whatever with an outfit change your it could be a simple ticket duos by the way siblings coming up together oh i'm assuming so well they would be number one and two so they can do that family you know well they'll be under one number can't judge them separately what i don't understand um i'm going to be a hold on george and i are going together and we need the poop and he'll be tigger and we're going to go together because we're the theme and we're going to have one number see but winnie the pooh and tigger i could see if like you were a dinosaur and you were the head and you were the tail you know those kind of costumes but if you're terrible at her little brother see a combination costume because it adds more to that one person you can do because where's the limit you have like whole families well then they got to split the price five ways so that's no big deal that actually gives opportunity for more kids to win if we do it like she's talking yeah i mean i don't know it's like you got two people we got two passes because you do family costumes every year it's deep i've never been on combo in my experience you guys do whatever you want i'm easy i'm just letting you know how it's going to come up so i believe if they had combos the last one and they stopped right now see i think i would think they could go up together if they're a theme but they would have separate numbers like it would be they had separate numbers yeah i remember ones that went alike then what if one part of the group gets a 10 and the other one gets a one well that means they didn't work hard enough on their own so you're a cute tigger and you're not very cute yeah yeah you could you could see that all right no like cruella and the dalmatian i mean clearly you're gonna give it to ella but that's sad for the little donation well they can decide to stick together after that yeah yeah they can see it's gonna come up yeah it's gonna come off that's really where it should be on if one or one wins they can slip the mom can decide how the um price gets split no it's a good point and we'll cross that bridge when we get to but i think if they were split last year people expect it and we should or not last year but the year before double all one number yeah so we i think every kid or every dog should have their own day number shall we take a vote i don't think i i'm she can make you an m m costume so all you have to do is wear a t-shirt with a yeah yeah it could be a peanut m m the yellow one i have lots of stuff in my store channel you can really just get away with some ears you know that really scared them you gotta pick your ears okay so costumes it is i mean if you need help george let me know but don't tell me the night before because let me know right now i need my help okay um yeah i i mean we should just all be eminem that'd be so cute to like find them and observe the people that like work the party we could all be having different colors yeah i have a ballerina costume you're really pushing it okay so costumes it is on one skittle oh what one skittle what yeah are you gonna be the skittle oh i thought that's what you're saying my ass all right we'll figure it out so halloween music is easy i literally was going to put together a playlist and then i was like ding ding and they already have one so they have it so we're good with the music we're good with the microphone um he's going to put the signs up is the sign is it still on course to be done so we can get it on the big sign the new sign yeah they're right in the concrete so they got it formed once they get that footer in there it's easy yeah okay double check that music though i think i know what you're talking about are okay and some of them are a little it's got the whole list you should save the monster mash for the for the uh okay yeah that's cute because everyone loves that you know and that's a fun choosing to kind of like get into that i made it oh that's a good one too yeah no there's lots of cute ones that i forgot about because i haven't had i used to have halloween parties for jake all the time when he was little i haven't had one in so long i have so much halloween stuff at our other house i would love but i just don't have anything here i have one little bucket which i have a little haircut okay so and then like just like i was kind of thinking all right we we have the six judges we have the table we really only need like the same person that passes out the water can pass out the treat bags after and then like we just need like somebody to hand out the numbers and the make sure that all the kids have the numbers and the safety pins on them can't we have candy cookies and then i'm i'm doing treat bags from for like for my business wow yeah um yeah um and then anthony might do tree bags so it's like anybody that's on the community table can do something if they want to i mean the city the city treatments all that stuff so like i might even come in earlier that week and if anybody has a little time um otherwise we're going to be doing treat bags that friday afternoon treat bags together earlier because i'm not going to be here for okay okay it is perfect bags are easiest to get a group and you just lay out each item and you just go around the bag you guys we're probably going to do that earlier in the week if she can't be here on friday so like you know we'll just look at the calendar do we have to let patty know when we're coming in to do tree packs that's not like official okay so we'll do treat bags earlier and then on friday we're going to do all the tables but that would be real quick i think um because those are there any decorations or we did good decorations right and we can use the black one we can set them all up so in case there are anything that there's one set of corrections i think it says happy halloween or something and then those circles we could that are black with black and white we can do those along the front um we could open them all up ready to go that wasn't that time consuming well the one table still say the hydration station the other table will still say community table and the only tables we're decorating are the two judges tables um and then i'm for sure we have enough decorations to do that get some pumpkins good and i hate that haystacks get expensive and corn stalks but that fish [Laughter] you just got shushed i'm teasing it okay maybe a pumpkin um so we have the microphone we're gonna have clipboards for the judges um forms treat bags so the halloween refreshments um i don't know kyle if we're gonna get these on friday or if we're going to wait and see saturday how many people we have because apple cider is expensive and like you know it's you can't return it and we want to make sure we have enough but we don't want like 10 gallons of apple cider vinegar in the cider and the jug right yeah that they have it publix and like a milk thing this time of year sometimes we get like two what's that it's a little eight ounces that's like 16 32 um servings and then if we need more just have the hot chocolate thing yeah we can just pour it in that and that way it's all done nobody has to stand up for it and it's a self-serve isn't it i wouldn't let anybody yeah i'm sorry but you could put three gallons in that i'm just saying it's easier than somebody having to do this all the time yeah yeah that's true and you can report you can just take yourself i don't want everyone in their sister touching that knife yeah it would be better for one person with gloves or not even gloves because you're not touching anything just otherwise just kidding i mean like three bucks we can always do apple juice too i'm just gonna if we don't want to do apple cider you could do apple juice and it would be half the price but i'm just saying like am i looking at an extra one and what we think because it's only three dollars yeah instead of running out of getting more yeah for sure i get excited for cider me too i love apple cider and i wouldn't drink apple juice i don't think i've ever tried it oh it's so good and then we'll see what publix has as far as like either halloween cookies or halloween donuts we can get a mix or we could just do with the you know they do the black and orange sprinkles but it'll be halloween whatever they have halloween themed is what kyle will get so those will be our refreshments and we just need napkins and we're going to do about 40 of those i think adults might partake depends on what it is what is it frosting i don't know most adults you're going to get at publix you're going to come across a lot of cupcakes maybe mini cupcakes would be ideal if you're going to go that route but frosting is nobody's friend with costumes yeah cookies is going to be the easiest to manage um don't saw some doughnut doughnuts it's fun i feel like all the everyone would like donuts donuts and cider kind of goes together too i'd go donuts and i would go at least 50 because adults will do that because you know they have the cake ones with the cinnamon they're already eating so much sugar and i get that donuts it's just fried sugar dough but it's still a little substance and it's like bready you know versus cakey and or no more so than the chocolate frosting yeah i did donuts you're getting like the dryers just do glazed donuts regular glazed donuts no but they have the cinnamon ones or the cinnamon apple ones that are so delicious with the apple cider do you have enough yeah we can do it and pre-order it from publix are really good about it we do it every month for the beach cleanup so he's a proud pre-ordering huh is better this time because i said something yeah i didn't need one but they looked better okay we do that cameron cocktail yeah that's good so yeah i think we we talked about donuts initially i think donuts insider is really really cute i think adults would appreciate that more too okay and the frosting's gonna get everywhere it doesn't have beach cleanup no but there's cupcakes can you do cupcakes no we do donuts oh that's what i'm saying oh yeah yeah yeah cupcakes yeah no we are staying there sticky looking yeah we never really talked about cupcakes oh i brought that up sorry no no you can bring it up bring up whatever you want i just i don't think we ever talked about cupcakes just because i was just saying what publix will have yeah i just wouldn't see what they have i would just order it cider and donut and water that's what we talked about initially we'll go on these guidelines and we have to make last minute call we can run right across the bridge and go get it okay and then we have napkins cups with signs we have our id badges so just bring those back we have the safety pins we have the numbers we i'm thinking we only need one garbage can and one recycle right by the water or right by the donut table whatever put out a kid's activity up a couple huh i put out a kid's activity on top of it i don't know like um what is that a corn hole i don't even think we're gonna have enough time to do what we're doing in the two hours unless you want to come and run it we're not doing an activity okay thank you takes a lot to like hurt people around i don't mean like organize an activity you just throw something out like beanbags on a court like yeah i don't think i'm i'm worried we're not gonna have time to do what we're doing in the two hours i just don't think we will especially like i don't think with the parade and then you know handing out the stuff and then like we'll just have it takes a little bit of time how much time are you gonna give um because you didn't put like show up or before the event or apparently any kind of like registration time so what time do you think the actual okay everybody's registered i'm hoping 10 30. so you say you're saying 30 minutes yeah people start showing up maybe a little earlier in 10 but then by 10 30 everybody's accounted for 10 15 10 30 if we have some stragglers because if we say it starts at 10 i would think that you know if it wasn't something before you got people there late yeah so if they're late they just go to the end of the line so even if it's already started they can still you know come up and that's why um or you know we could just do an add-on at the end we'll figure that out because yeah i mean you're not going to turn away a little kid in a costume because they're 20 minutes late we can make it happen yeah do we have anyone pre-registered uh three kids and a dog that i know of cool let me ask you another question i thought of when we were talking to you um are we gonna assign them a number or something like that you can keep track of them they have numbers like runners you know how they all have those numbers and they're safety pinned onto their costumes or their leash yeah we have numbers okay we're going to be in charge of the safety pins yeah that's exactly right that's why i was like maybe you can incorporate that into your costume george you can incorporate that into your costume get your harry potter one but it could be a safety pin okay yeah so it's like there's two sets of numbers so it'll look just like the the form so it's like there's a set of one through 50 for the dogs and they're set of one through 50 for the kids so there'll be a dog that's number one and a kid that's number one but they have different numbers like you know there's different sets of numbers okay so yeah they'll have that so when they come up to say their name and their you know we'll put it you know i'll i have like a master one that i will give to dave so dave will say number one is susie and that's all he knows because i you know on this he just needs number one and the name right and um and yeah they definitely have numbers because then that's all the judges will really know them by their number so it's easier to keep track of that way so they come up and we pin them there'll be a little registration yes so the community table is the registration table but like we there can be a couple of us there at that time like handing out like the numbers because it doesn't matter what number what number they are they just then they have to get in line in that number so they can be passed out in any order yes cool and then we have the same doors open for the bathroom and everything yes yeah do we need signs for the bathroom again those were nice that you had that then people even though the doors were closed they knew that they could go in yeah okay so it's only what two hours two hours okay i think people could use the bathroom before they got here i mean i can't go that long you can't go then no especially if i'm drinking a lot of water don't drink the water don't drink the water okay what if you have a little kid that has to go to the bathroom all right i mean there's no reason to not have the bathroom available it's like no go home and then come back yeah costumes a lot of white costumes i can't remember was it [Music] it wasn't open though because i was out there the whole time when i was someone there's another one a lot yeah yeah i think that's true it's very nice to have the community center bathroom available when we're having a community event i think like it's like i'm just trying to think of a little different options the option to not have a bathroom throw it out there okay so i vote for the bathroom uh okay so are we good with one garbage can and one recycle or should we have one by the water table and one bite recycling water bottles and cups oh yeah we under water bottles okay that's right i was just thinking we should do the donuts and cider at the same table as the water and the the treat bags will be by the numbers i think i'll do like actual recycling bins this time because we didn't want to get that much okay so let's do that okay because they're water bottles a lot of people took them with them i think yeah they did yeah and then i'll probably have a couple of garbage okay and then we'll have our new suggestion box nicole suggested that if we have one bellar beach sticker left this with blue and black writing that should go right on the front of that uh today we sold it like a day after the first one yeah that's okay it's okay okay so is there um i have gone through everything on my list so everyone will be wait just you know it won't be here will you be here for what the halloween thing us okay just checking no i thought you were gonna be here too i'll be here what instead of me you're gonna be yeah i'll be here okay anyway that's kind of what i envisioned does anybody have a different vision or a different idea or no that won't work let's do it this way no we're just gonna make it work if it's a rain day if it is a rain day we said no rain day we talked about this if if it's pouring down rain or lightning we didn't talk about moving it into the building i mean we can but we didn't talk about it if we do i think like if it rain like if it does rain we could just like have it in there and kind of have the same setup we could we just wouldn't have the parade we just want to have prank yeah at least they could still come and like talk to their neighbors and the kids can see each other like it's kind of like a play date for children well the dogs that's the problem that's the thing they didn't want the dogs in the building that's why that's why we weren't moving dang damn it [Music] yeah yeah we didn't call a rain day on the jazz we put rain or shine on the halloween thing we did not because of the dogs yeah yeah well yes i felt we said that we just say no rain day what are we saying we didn't say anything i mean worst case we can just do it sunday all right i'm not out of town i literally leave the second this thing is over oh yeah i mean we can but oh yeah okay every day is sunny it hasn't rained in two months it seems like yeah especially around the morning yeah so one thing i don't know um like i'll i can do like the middle or the beginning um do you can you help with the parade like tim and stanley will be at the end and then one of us needs to be at the beginning and then one needs to be in the middle to kind of someone asked me what happens if someone brings a cat and i was like well if they bring a cat i'm assuming it's gonna be in a box or a stroller a cat who said that no it's a halloween cat okay it says pets it doesn't say dog i'm gonna freak out if someone brings a snake dressed up as like i don't freaking know i'm i'm out like this part of a costume be like sorry britney spears is not allowed that's all it might be like you know it's in a stroller or in a container yeah as long as it's contained and they can hurt it it's it's kind of open we said pets i didn't say dogs yeah you put a costume on a snake i don't know like a little hat like a little sombrero that's what i envisioned okay a dragon costume for her bearded dragon it's got wings see it's a leash i'm sure they make that sounds like a combination for greatness i'm gonna just pray no one brings a snake or anything weird but you never know a chinchilla we do live by the ocean you never know all right okay so we'll deal with that when we get to it but um anything else that anybody thought of that we could do or suggestions or they didn't say and they invited pets all the way through it never said dogs pets and pals and you were thinking like well someone raised a cat no you think they're [Music] said what if someone brings their cat and i said oh well it is pets they just need to probably be in a stroller or uh yeah with a net and a zipper so the dogs can't get to it are they kids or the coyotes exactly i don't think anyone's gonna i think i i think it's just gonna be dogs but we'll just cross i mean and that big thick they're real crafty i mean they always clown at nights they're hiding all day all morning too throughout early morning but they could be calling on their houses i mean i don't know we can go in a are small small groups of wooded areas they burrow down near it you're not going to notice that they're there they're pretty built up so right here i can bring a coyote as a pet put a harness on it and a costume you're golden no you're helping me with the costume so i'll just bring the coyote no then it's going to be a sushi burrito so we need to be here at 9 30 is 30 minutes enough time to set up because we just have to carry out the four tables and sure that's it everything else will be done that's great okay all right are we good with that i guess if anything comes up we can deal with it like the friday before or whatever like that week before cool anyone anything else no okay cool um item agenda um item number six all other business so in our budget just rolled over and um since jazz went so well kyle and i were kind of talking about because like i i s it's a picture and i didn't print it out but it was kind of cute but um like if we did a spring event we need to start thinking about themes or whatever um but just based on the crowd and the demographics of beller beach like a fly me to the moon like rat pack frank sinatra um who else was in rat pack sammy davis jr and tony bennett dean martin dean martin anyway so the band that played for jazz they have a singer that does all frank sinatra and then they can play that music and i thought if we did the italian ice again we could get a pizza truck and then still everybody could bring their own coolers whatever they wanted to drink and it would be more like an italian thing as opposed to a jazz thing for a spring event but that's just throwing out an idea but like after halloween as the year goes on everybody can throw their ideas in in the in the ring and then we can think about maybe doing one spring event because we didn't do anything in the spring last year because of covid but if for 2022 if we did one thing in spring maybe end of april beginning of may kind of after spring break before it gets hot and everybody leaves and then we stick to the same schedule if the halloween thing goes well and the christmas thing goes well because the christmas thing you know we'll see how that goes you know if it's if it doesn't attract any more than the people that just come to the meeting like this last meeting there was hardly anybody there i mean it was very small so how much was the ban the band was 800. i got a quote from a band it was four thousand i said you're a little bit pianos dueling pianos how are we going to get a piano here two of them how are we going to get two pianos they have them i've had a party with people okay and they bring i know a local a guy that's in a band actually he's like one of my financial advisors what kind of band i don't know i mean i really don't i just i love those ideas it's great okay well that's just like i'm just i'm just thinking it isn't why do you think that's so crazy though it's the same thing as setting up like an or piece no i don't think it's so crazy like moving a piano it's not they're not moving baby brands out here oh see that's what i picked because any dueling piano bars that i've ever been at too they have the big like the baby grand it's like yeah it look it's a it's a hollowed shell that they put on over it for a lot of i mean i've been to bars that are doing pianos yeah that sounds fun i don't know how much two was gonna be singles i don't know what's the theme of that what do you mean is there a theme to the event with the dueling pianos because she had like sort of an italian theme oh like trying food to the pianist yeah and like what is the event is it just get piano i don't know it's nothing that we have to decide now and we can like because we probably won't even present it to be voted on by council till like january or something like that um we don't need to do it now but just i thought we should talk about if we wanted first of all if we even want to do a spring event at all which i think we should um because like our budget is essentially the same even though it's 4 000 as opposed to 6 000 the t-shirts and the towels and all that stuff doesn't come out of our budget anymore which was a chunk which is sad because like we um we can't find towels to make new like logoed ones to save ourselves like amazon is completely out of everything unless the price doubles and what we things that are were more expensive were poor quality compared to the ones that we just sold out of so it's kind of a bummer we'll just keep looking though they were a limited time item oh did you contact the seller no i didn't but i was just saying that's kind of what they were yeah it's like they were trying to blow them out and then they were gone but anyway so it's like i'm gonna do an inventory on what we have back there um and then i didn't i'm assuming that we're not setting up a sells table for merchandise that halloween we're only doing it for christmas is that what we talked about when are we doing like the whole christmas thing that's december 6 and it's only for one hour with the christmas carolers before the meeting so then we should definitely have them reach out for there because just in case like a neighbor wants to buy a name or something or whatever but the halloween one i don't know we barely have enough time today it's on a monday it's on the monday yeah it's friday did we have to what time was it again five o'clock yeah the meeting starts at six it was literally we have christmas carolers from five to six we're gonna do christmas cookies and hot chocolate or coffee or whatever i think was hot chocolate chocolate and then do a merchandise table and then that's really it like the christmas tree it's just really a christmas social there's not a whole lot to it other than just so actually we'll have the tree out but it won't be lit until that day cool awesome and it'll definitely be dark by them with the time change um so i know i gotta i know wendy's on board and laura said she would help and pat said she was always have to double check with those two and then i'll contact the judges and dave and let them kind of know to be there 15 minutes early and if they could please wear a costume even if dave would wear a top hand it would be cute or you know whatever just because he's emcee but like to see if i can get them on board with the costume thing um for those of you that weren't at the meeting on monday and you didn't listen to it the mayor mentioned that we might need a liability form for the beach cleanup so the city attorney is looking into that and um we'll see where that goes so that's beach cleanup is really is that an official activity of the city yeah yeah i didn't think it was volunteers it is a bunch of volunteers yes so he wants volunteers to sign waivers because we're responsible for the parking lot we'll see where it goes i mean truly i think everyone that volunteers for the city should sign a waiver saying they won't sue the city if something happens all volunteers should have to sign that it's not a bad idea but everybody has to sign if you volunteer here you should have to sign but we'll see where it goes i'm not sure will it be ready by the sixth i'm just gonna wait and see what happens like they know when it is it's the same time every month so if someone brings me a stack of forms i'll have everyone sign one at the beach if i don't get a stack of forms i'll wait until like you know i hear something i'm not really sure what do you think that sounds right oh yeah yeah we're still going to have it so i can make it that morning yeah we're still going to have it um so okay but i think that's really all that came out of the meeting on monday right there was there was nothing else really new or no no it was like yeah it was just positive feedback really um but if you guys could maybe take a look at the website and if you have any input on that i did ask patti and kyle which was so awesome because they had like a stock picture on the fitness page or the activity page of like people that don't live here but now when you look it's people that live here at our activities so it's like there's a picture on there now from the last beach cleanup and it's like five or six people and they're walking towards the beach and they're turning around facing me like waving and it's a cute picture so and we'll switch that out like once a month so you know we'll leave that one on a month and then maybe put one on for jazz and then we'll switch it out and put so it's like we'll put one on there after the halloween of like all the kids like a group picture or something like that yeah so we can change it out like once a month after things but it's of real events and real people that live here and then [Music] i don't know i think that's it does anybody have anything else that they want to talk about or no so the next get-together for us is going to be 2 30 on friday yeah 2 30 on friday and we might george do you get text messages yes okay because i text you and you never respond i've texted you like three times really i was like well i'll after the meeting i'll check and see if i'm text because i sent out group text for all of us and i've sent you texts just saying hey i've never
