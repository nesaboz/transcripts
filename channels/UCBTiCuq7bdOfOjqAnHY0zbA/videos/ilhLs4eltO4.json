    "transcript": "hello everyone recording in progress there we go hello everyone at 6pm and the june 6th regular council meeting will now come to order please rise and join me in the pledge of of the united allegiance of america to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all council member frank baker president council member leslie ontario here council member lloyd roberts here council member joey shirley here council member by disabled here vice mayor gunn president mayor dave dallas here city manager reeves yeah and city attorney randy warren [Music] thank you maddie our first order of business is the approval of the agenda um i have two items that i would like to change and then i'm going to ask the council if there's anything they would like to change uh the first is the date on item four it should be 2021 not 2019. and then the second item is item 12 and 13 i think that they should be swapped and uh the reason why is uh even though it's it's probably something that we can pass through pretty quickly it's still something that uh someone may want to discuss so i would like 13 to become 12 and 12 to become 13 and then the new 13 policy through the rank or agenda i'll move to approval all in favor aye aye all right the agenda is now amended do i have a motion to approve the committed agenda banker second all seriously favor the amended agenda is approved all right let's move right on to item two which is citizen comments um any citizen would like to address the council a topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand right to be called on we ask that you limit your comments in order for three minutes to speak uh yes ma'am even far right corner second road good evening mayor council members katie cole of the law firm of billboard henderson 600 cleveland street suite 800 clearwater florida um i'm here tonight representing the las caracolis condominium association and you've had a number of other people raise your hands tonight because there are uh several residents and owners of other conventions that are on along the beach and we wanted to speak to you tonight about the proposed ordinance that's been sent to fwc with respect to the swim buoys and the vessel exclusion zone and first off we understand that this has been going on for about a year and unfortunately some of the meeting notices into the general addresses of the condominiums not to specific units or the management companies and so there's been a bit of a game of catch-up for some of these owners to get an understanding of what's happening and why and so we wanted to come tonight knowing that it's not on the agenda but that you all have sent a proposed ordinance to fish and wildlife that is necessary to come into compliance with what the prior program was but the extent of that ordinance and the opinion of many of these residents goes too far the addition of buoys over the number of movies that are out there tonight or today is a concern it's also a concern that if the choice is to have a vessel exclusion zone and swim only area versus what's there today which is simply notice that there might be swimmers in the area and no weight zone candidly the owners along the beaches would prefer to have no buoys there is not an issue today with boat traffic and swimmers and conflicts between the two there's not an issue with a large number of boats anchoring in this area and attempting to swim up to shore and create the situation and the addition of these movies and the change of the status quo is not something that these residents would like to see so i know that we have several here if you all want to raise your hand um some others from some of uh jim robbins with foster pulse is also here wants to say a few words but we wanted to come tonight we appreciate i know mr reeves has been in contact with some of the residents here i've been in contact the past week with mr mora we understand that this is a work in progress with the fwc and i certainly wanted to make our uh our opinion known to you all and then work together with the city on what the right solution is so we appreciate that okay um i'm gonna pause it for one second um i i don't have a problem with anyone that wants to speak on this topic but everyone is here to speak on this particular topic please raise your hand okay so what i would like to do is let's go ahead and take care of these first and uh and let's do it orderly each person take your three minutes come up say your name give your address and then whenever you're finished we'll just take the next one and we'll go right down the line okay and that way we'll expedite the meeting we certainly appreciate that thank you thank you and i'm jim robbins 2523 prospect group tampa florida 33629 but also a property owner at 2450 gulf boulevard las caracolas first i want to say thank you for giving us a little time tonight we have been playing catch up on this and we certainly appreciate the city staff the city attorney getting us up to speed with the information so we now know what's going on just a brief comment um my family and i've been over here for over 25 years now a boater distance swimmer and paddle boarder and as katie said with the choices between i certainly appreciate the buoys that are there the choices uh need to remove those those are no longer compliant we'd be in favor of that but no designated swim zones or boat zones or additional movies out there not seen any problem i think people are very respectful when they're operating motor vessels in that area for a host of reasons but very respectful the swimmers and others in the water so others are going to echo that but our condominium uh 32 units there and other kind of meetings we've been in touch with i think are of a similar view and you may hear that here behind me so thank you very much for your time this evening thank you mr roberts 4601 west san miguel street tampa florida we are owners of a unit at solely zombra 2250 gulf boulevard unit g1 i have been in contact with all 16 owners at soli sombra as well as owners at aldea and sangrisa across the board everyone is against designating a boat zone and a swim zone we feel that it's not necessary there really are very few votes that come that close come up close to the shore and it is not necessary and it will be unsightly and we hope that you will will respect our opposition and that you will help us with this thank you thank you my name is joe gibbons i'm a relationship boater at 2300 northfield boulevard out of america this has come to my attention and my family's attention and the rest of the owner's attention 1973 we are also voters we're very respected of it and to my knowledge there is never been an incident of any conflict between voters and swimmers i run all the way from uh by boat from ahrp down to angelo in no other place else do i ever see this that there's destination zones on those beaches uh there used to be something in delaware beach if it's there i'm not aware of it and that's a different situation than we are that's much more of a public beach then we do have some public access that we've been branded in there again we've never experienced a problem we would like for the city council and make sure that everybody was informed on this but it came down to her being compliance with fwc with no buoys versus having to entertain swim zone and additionally thank you thank you good afternoon my name is karen mills my address is 3006 west euclid avenue in tampa florida but i am also representing my husband who could not be here tonight we are a nursing 245-0 golf boulevard which is los para coldness and i'm going to read something that my husband read into the minutes um there is no confidence's substantial evidence that has been presented as to the need for swim zones if the existing buoys are required to be removed by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission then prior to the city ordinance there should be rescinded and not revised to create swimsuits the ordinance is unnecessary and represents an attempt by the city to tell people where they can and can't swim in the gulf the proposed ordinance has the potential of many unintended consequences such as creating a boating zone whereby boats can gather wrapped up raft up or even anchor along the beach if this pose states that these excluded areas shall be free from restriction so if the ordinance was adopted how would these areas be controlled or governed and then finally the language of the proposed ordinance is written incorrectly as the swim zones are shown on the map are descripted as areas excluded from swim zones but the bottom line is um in our five years of owning a place out there we've seen very little boat traffic and i just don't understand for long distance swimmers open water swimmers how they would be swimming along and then have to stop and get out and go to the next area where the swim zone started that just doesn't make sense to me so i very much appreciate you hearing our concerns about this and hope that you will consider them when this ordinance does come up for review thank you thank you very much anyone else on this topic okay thank you very we'll move on much other comments that anyone else would like to speak please come out and state your name in your address hello my name my address is 106.13 bellar beach i'm a relatively new resident i want to welcome you all i received the magazine telling me all about the new council and the mayor and also and i was glad to read that got some of you in here so that you were interested in what the residents felt and had to say so being that relatively new resident here it's been about a year now and when i was buying the property the relator was telling me all about that i was riding across the street from the beach and how wonderful it was and all the things and my daughter is a new resident here in miller beach as well down off the 22nd street and so i said okay great sounds great and we came and got settled and i finally went across the street to go see the beach and i was greeted by this massive sign that told me all the things that i couldn't do and i was quite surprised to say the least and so anyway it's taken us a while to get settled and with the new council when i started talking to different residents and they were introducing themselves to me i heard so many stories my head was going to explode i heard that you know the council was not well and the lights were not good i heard that there was negotiations going on about rescinding the shape code that went through because that was probably the one that threw me the most that you couldn't have any shade at all and then i heard that the prior mayor initiated a lawsuit and i've heard so many things that i'm so perplexed now that i don't know where the city is on that issue but i am very sad because i moved here 10 of us moved here the whole tribe came all of us and you know i have a granddaughter who has a great grandson now i have my daughter who resides here in bel air now clueless having a grandson and when we plan to go to the beach we plan to go to the beach to enjoy not just walk the shoreline not just go in the water and then leave and so i guess i'm here today to try to find out where this issue stands and was it correctly passed this code by the bel air shores um health council and what are we doing in bella beach about this issue thank you very much how will i even know will someone give me i'm not sure how this works generally during other comments we do not respond okay uh i will say that this is an ongoing court case that we're not involved in and there are i may be considering progress is happening but this is something that we really need to okay well i would appreciate that and i would appreciate you taking into consideration that there are families that would love to go to the beach and spend three or four hours as a family at the beach and be able to be protected i can't take these children to the beach and come and expose for that long period of time without shade it's just not appropriate and not healthy so i thank you for hearing me today thank you anyone else [Music] um all right we're on item three which is the law enforcement report from the global company community council the biggest highlights of the city's crunch statistics of the month of april there's going to be there were a total of 15 arrests however none of them included any of the residents of the city as you know with the beach the causeway and people coming from clearwater beach when our dedications are out doing traffic enforcement we tend to catch people coming from all different directions and the stops just happen to happen in your city so they get intact being within the city um of the 15 arrests six of them were all traffic related whether it be dui's driving unsuspecting license things of that nature there were a couple of drug possession arrests which again came from traffic stops there was a domestic battery which was from someone who was staying at a lodging facility here on vacation who was not a resident of the city deputies doing traffic enforcement issued a total of 171 warnings or citations within the city there are also 36 parking warnings four citations issued at the beach accesses and those are pretty much the highlights outside of the normal house checks neighborhood checks traffic control getting out and monitoring the beach access and just being highly versatile for first of all best chief to hear me okay back there beach i've been on the beach obviously out there swimming looking around but uh it's considerably eroding we have no injury nourishment in sight right now and we've seen incidents with deputies patrolling in an suv on on the beach i mean maybe 30 foot of sand i'm asking this council member can you use the atv that you have stored in the house back here instead of using the suv on the beach i mean we're just trying to conserve our sand as possible that that is definitely an option that we have um the deputies that you see on the beach those suvs are actually four wheel drive that's why they're able to go out there because a normal on one of our normal tacos would not be able to make it through that soft sugar sand to get to the hard pack sand but the polaris side-by-side that we have in the garage back there it is much smaller and i can get with captain liner and give him your suggestion and you're concerned about the beach erosion and being able to use that vehicle versus right that's kind of you just kind of pointed it out you said you got a four-wheel drive issue in the sand so that's that's what we're trying to get to you've got to say what stands for yeah because they're not making any more um second of all it's not a mystery that the gulf causeway two-way turn has had a lot of community comments um can you point to i have had an increase in vehicle accidents and citations specifically about the tooling term since it's been put in place i know that it's been questions that we've had asked numerous times and people who are familiar with this area they navigate it well now that it's been there for quite some time and unfortunately enough if someone is in the outer lane and they're going to make a turn for indian rocks that people who are in the left lane are nice enough to allow them to merge in without there being any kind of issue so as far as any real uptick in any kind of crashes or any violations that are any kind of red flags we have not seen that much please thank you yes sir council members okay yeah i just saw on um first page here that there was a uh a sex offense and three of those sex events did you elaborate on that correct in in the way that our system tracks our report our reporting system tracks things is that if someone makes an allegation the allegation that they make unless you can say that it did not occur that's how the report gets filed that particular that particular incident that you're referring to is a incident that occurred where someone ended up at a local facility as far as a lodging facility that had been in clearwater in tampa i believe out partying they woke up at the lodging facility and they felt as though something occurred during the course of the evening but they weren't sure where it heard so we documented what they could remember and because they could not recall exactly where it took place it happens to be that since they were staying at that facility again like when we do traffic stops if somebody's coming from clear water and they happen to you know come down boulevard and we stopped it here because we stopped in here or the call originates from the city limits it gets tagged here okay so it may not be something that actually occurred here but because it's where it originated that's where our reporting system places it okay yes sir mr megan how often do you guys uh schedule these controls as councilmember was talking about uh there is uh we tried to do one at least once per shift and even we usually try to do them during sunset that way we can get address any of the ordinance issues that plus check the parking lots make sure people have the proper permits and whatnot but usually in the mornings about sun sunrise you know when we get most of your foot traffic you have people that are out exercising and walking the beaches and usually sunset are the two times that we try to deputies could come out more frequently depending upon what the parking lots look like the parking lots look full and obviously there's a lot of people out on the beach they would give it another another pass to make sure everything is good that there's no violations or you know sometimes people just like to come up and talk to us and ask us questions yeah i was getting more or less beach control so i you guys are great for everything but uh i see you alive in the park lives but seems like this past year i haven't seen much of the beaches i i can definitely check the numbers and see what we've done but i know that there is a standing order for at least one during the day and one during the respect is that the contractor yes yes that is that is the order that from my understanding captain liner has spoken with uh council in the past and that has been established and it is within the city responsibilities for the deputies that are out here um just curious whenever you pull into one of those parking lots and you see somebody doesn't have a permit or a sticker what what's the what's the normal routine for you well education is a wonderful thing um there are some people who want to push the envelope because they know that these parking lots are so close to the beach so there are a handful of people who we've come into contact you know education the first time the second time then you get a parking pilot um but since it is private property outside of issuing violations there's not much more we can do with that you know once the party violation is issued then it's whether or not they pay it or this council we had a conversation on increasing patrolling and uh and then trying to figure out we've already started conversations about what to do about the parking lot the accesses and how to handle that uh i appreciate your time thank you very much for the report absolutely and in regards to the beach patrol i will get with captain liner in regards to these side by side versus the top section thank you any other questions yes john hanson 22nd street our questions for the uh court rule um when he gives the statistics it's blended where it's um warnings and citations we don't often hear how many warnings how many citations and the last point that was made was parking and i was listening and he said the first thing is education okay um i'm not a well in my mind the education is quite clear and simple when you go to the entrance of these beach access parking areas the education is clear and simple permit required it's not open for arbitration and we've heard stories in the past about deputies going up and down the beach looking for people that have parked illegally so my thing is and as you just mentioned mr mayor we need to be looking at this we don't need to educate anymore the education is right there at the entrance to the parking lot of washington right simple thank you thank you jewels chairman 3207 hibiscus drive west beach regarding the any violations or accidents that we had or didn't have on that left turn signal i as well as most everyone here that's on the north side of the bridge would be turning left sometimes you're in the right left terminal sometimes from the left left leg and people are not always kind of letting you in people are always trying to not always most of the time it it just seems like it's to me it seems like it's not working and the residents that i'm speaking with are saying that it's not working um it was i think it was initiated to um ease up traffic but now the way it is now you cannot turn left on the yellow flashing light whereas before you stop and if there was no oncoming traffic you could turn left you cannot do that anymore so traffic is backed up the same amount that it was backed up before but unfortunately if the sheriff's well if the sheriff's car is there you know people are going to be paying attention to the traffic kind enough to let somebody come in not necessarily honking or getting the finger for somebody that is cutting them off um that being said so it's it's not really apples to apples i think i just think that it's something that we should look at again i don't i don't believe that it's working [Music] thank you thank you any other comments all right now we move to the open enforcement report uh black guy is not here tonight and uh city manager raised believers yes erin console uh you've got a copy of the code enforcement report we have 52 incidents that happen over the month most of them are checking permits we had 11 items that weren't there was no violation even though we got a call to check something there was they thought it was a parking violation or what have you we did start a process with trying to encourage the rental registration that a couple of the condos were it was lacking we did start a program there one of the deputies uh going to check to see and i will say it became fruitful because we had about 12 people that took the rental registration fee that was so that was a fruitful situation we had 11 permit checks three parking issues and four landscaping other violations are just things that we follow up on but for the most part it was a relatively quiet month thank you very much council any questions i do have one mr griefs um as i drive around at bella beach i noticed that there are a few addresses that have trees drugs stages that are sticking beyond a clear violation they're literally hanging out over the streets they are blocking neighbor's views trying to exit their driveways and there they don't seem to be i don't think we're enforcing that properly uh or maybe i'm missing something and maybe but definitely something that i'd like to have a deeper conversation with and find out what can we do about this is it just a directive at this point yeah it's a code enforcement officer uh we've had a few i will tell you in the last last week in fact if you haven't set up the letters now about those situations typically they're occurring the same person's doing it again they tell them to cut it and then they cut it and two months later it's back in the same situation so um they're they're the ordinance does say you can't go out feeling the current life and things of that future so uh okay thank you very much any other questions all right let's move on to item four which is consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial reward for the fiscal year before we before we do this a patty what happened to uh vice president he's there he is i'm sorry you were not a member of the great bus for for a few seconds all right great uh so anyway uh back time for consideration of accepting the annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ending september 30th 2021 okay do we have a representative from salt marsh uh cleveland and guns right there let's see um what's here my name is chuck landers with salt marsh cleveland and gun i'm fortunate opportunity to serve as the honest shareholder for the city of bellaire beach we should greatly appreciate the opportunity to serve as your auditors in the past you've seen janine bettinger and richard christine they have since retired i do believe they still may be doing some consulting work around them but they're no longer with salt marsh and i again i have the privilege of serving as the auto shareholder i believe you have the draft financial segments in your package to go through it not in a lot of detail but the most important thing is that it is an unmodified opinion so that that's the cleanest opinion how much detail would you like to go into well if you have a reader's digest summary you'd like to give us that would be a great start all right readers digest we're going to just talk about a few numbers then something that i i wouldn't say are worth discussing on page 17 this is the statement of that position at the bottom of page 17 there's a section called that position i'll point out that the net investment in capital assets is 10.5 almost 10.6 million and then the unrestricted net position is 5.3 million for total net position that the city has of 15.894 million dollars 15.9 million that that is an indication that the assets of the city far exceed the liabilities of the city by approximately 15.9 million that's an important number that i'll point out i would then turn to page 23. this is the fund balance budget and actual for the general fund the seed that's in the middle of the page is the final budget for the general fund uh halfway down total revenues were budgeted at 2 377 000 actual came in at 2 708 000 for a favorable favorable variance of 331 000. i would then jump to the bottom almost at the bottom of that page for the net change in fund balance the third column over actual increase of 192 200 which is a favorable variance of almost 185 budget tremendous i would turn the page then to page 24 and the only item i'll point out here is that in 2021 the city created the stormwater fund and you'll see that this is the statement of that position that includes the stormwater fund and the marina fund and then a combination of those two funds combined i won't they just point out that page because the stormwater fund is new in 2021 i would then draw your attention to page 44. this is note 5 the change in capital assets and this is a reconciliation that takes you from the capital assets at the beginning of the year the additions the dispositions and the transfers to the end of the year municipality that is an important amount of information to understand what is what the city has what's being added what's being disposed of so it just wants you to point that out to you we'll continue with further good news on page 85. municipal audits have to be done in accordance with governmental auditing standards this report is the independent auditor's report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with government auditing standards there are two important the two most important sentences in this two-page report the first one is the next last sentence on the first page given these limitations during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses that's the sentence you're looking for on that page if you turn the page to page 86 into paragraph compliance and other matters the last sentence of that paragraph the results of our tests disclose no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under government auditing standards that's what you want to hear in those reports absolutely and the last bit is the very last page on page 89. this is the independent officer's report on compliance with section 218.415 before statutes regarding the investment of public funds during the year and our opinion is in our opinion the city of bel air beach complied with all material respects with the aforementioned requirements for the year ended in september 30th 2021. so all in all you have four positive opinions to this report thank you very much council mr dunn i would say that the one thing i didn't see this has seen past reports for this trends and forecasts and i don't know if that's something that you just don't know anymore who's interested to read that stuff and draw their own conclusions the different years again forecast that would be information that is outside of the basic financial statements there is a statistical section which shows historically information and you can come to your own conclusions on trends from that but that i believe what you're referring to will be outside of the basic financial statements it could be included there's nothing to say that additional information cannot be there so if the city council would like to have city staff include additional non-required supplemental information we can do that what was the statistical immigration the statistical information starts if we turn the thoughts did you mind it [Music] and i would i would encourage everyone to read the management discussion and analysis as well that's kind of a plain english version of all the numbers and notes that this any other questions all right uh in that case uh uh it comes to a vote to uh accept the annual comprehensive financial fiscal year in september 30th 2019. promotion oh you're right it's 20 minutes there too okay uh we already have a motion uh all in favor aye aye aye opposed so all right we accept the report thank you thank you all right now we are on to item 5 which is the city attorney thank you mr mayor uh pleasure being here at my first official meeting though we've had the opportunities thus far to sit in on a workshop and meeting the cac last month we are off to a good start i met with the manager reeves for a few hours on friday to talk about a series of action items begun preparing and transmitting research on some of the pending issues beginning to review ordinances that have been prepared and are in the hopper to try and advance those and make sure they've done my own independent review with that i'm happy to answer any questions you have or concerns to this point council vice made or none no i i do have one uh of your evaluation and planning uh does any of that have to do with these sign movements i'm not specifically though i have that as an action based on the research or rather the interview process that we went through i've not yet reached that issue as there were some that were more time sensitive namely the fwc lewis issues and and others that have been percolating i also you were all sent a memorandum that i prepared concerning text messages as public records and digital media's public records that was not i don't know i sent it without a lot of context i was not prepared as a result of anything specifically in this community i've been doing that research on behalf of a handful of communities based on litigation i've been involved in and thought i thought i've asked that all of our elected officials be aware of that that's been said both it's been said here and in the other communities that i serve and back to your question about the sign code as you know tonight we're talking about the insurance manager as that interior manager establishes the priorities and needs will certainly address where they feel that fits in based on the existing needs and need to catch up on that issue okay thank you very much anyone else all right moving on to item six which is the city manager's report take it away mr reeves aaron console uh the report is in the uh in your agenda packet from some of our discussions over the last couple of weeks the greatest project evaluation will start started looking at doing some hammering both boulevard underground we're still waiting for duke energy to come forward with their bid and finally design 7th street program renovation along with the 16th we've given a notice of award and the contract has been executed and the company is in the process of giving you some timelines for materials city seawall project that's our whole funding at some point the city council needs to determine if they want to replace the playground in baseline park a small kids playground and tonight we're working on we're doing second reading 94 which has been a long time coming i did get information today that's not on this report the sheriff's increase is going to be 5.28 um you were given uh the budget that you received tonight the updated motion with the current property evaluation and we have a budget work session on the 20th of june and we still are waiting on waste management that's really the only other thing that's outstanding that we don't have a final cost because they are going to ask first an additional increase here all right thank you very much mrs bruce now we're on to the city clerk's report ms gentry the main thing is the city manager search process on doing spreadsheets for all of the scoring for each applicant and then that's complete the committee will meet again and review those so that they can get it to council and then for the future projects these are just things that are in the archive room that need to be on an ongoing basis they need to be done so scheduling future destruction and reorganizing uh you know big condominium cabinet is full of the flaps and the um blueprints so straighten that up that's it any questions for us henry uh remember this if we had a system is yes oh there you go mr hansen please john hanson 103 22nd street um question really is for the city manager i've been following this the gulf war [Music] underground do we have any explanation as to why duke energy is dragging its anchor and do they not have a drop dead date to give us a binding cost well they they gave us a mining cost and then uh when we asked for them to update the positive whatever 30 so we went back to them and uh and asked them to relook at it and i've had some discussion with them about there's some credits that we got on the w states underground so i've asked them about that and i have been in contact with them i recall that conversation from last month's report so just worried about things going through the roof you know we went through this last week with the front the bedroom on the stormwater thank you just for the future just to let everyone know it's generally not a back-and-forth conversation with the city manager the city attorney or the city clerk that's why i did not call on anyone and i i went had a council member call on you but generally i'm not doing that so that's not the way that this council runs and we'll reserve our comments for the beginning of the meeting or during agenda items and uh this is not part of your regular achievement so i apologize if there's any confusion but i just wanted to make that clear all right let's move on to yes sir mr mr gunn is still talking about the state clerk report i guess i had a question of talking about the state manager hiring process we were pretty diligent in establishing the timeline and some of the uh the processes and some durations and stuff i'm just looking at are we taking down that timeline when we kind of outline or we're sticking and also what what are we looking at for the conclusion before the city manager hiring process whether we see that being complete yes i think we're doing very well on the timeline um and then as far as completed i really don't can you help me with that as yeah i don't unfortunately i don't have the calendar in front of me but there was a calendar that was sent out to all the council members uh i know she's working on the sport sheets to get the we got everything in and she's working on putting story sheets together for a spreadsheet to get to the citizens advisory council to have a meeting to confirm who their live candidates are and then after they have their confirmation that will be given to us now let me uh be clarified you are not uh you're not scoring the candidates right you're just you're you're compiling this four seats we went through that schedule twice we had the changes from city manager i submitted those back but i still haven't seen those back for you that day one our original discussion was it could if it's you one way or the other right that was our general guideline yes sir uh vice mayor yeah and and to that mind i guess i would just like to see is that outline with checkered parts and dates completed or whatever is coming kind of marked around what is being gained or losing track i mean i just i guess i'm looking for a little more definitive progress and foreign [Music] yes we are doing that and so right now what i'm doing is doing the final one to get all the numbers in then we can set the date for the next meeting which was the 7 30 that was on the timeline that was sent out i mean i can send it out again if the vice president doesn't have it but we did send it out revised and then like let's say it's kind of in flux because as each part comes due then that determines the date for the next one but i feel like you're spitting pretty close to the original timeline yeah i i think they're very close um we might be slipping a day or two on the scoring because i think we were a little aggressive with it but right and patty was uh and and the prisoner of the code of the issue would be behind a little bit but she's working on them uh she can probably tell you how far she is along with 28 applicants and then she's going to do a a one sheet that basically says this is what every person is for okay i think what vice mayor done i'm sorry don't disagree would you just maybe update us on an email [Music] any other questions all right let's move on to ordinance number 2201 this is the second reading mr mora would you please read the ordinance number 22-01 an ordinance of the city council of the city of bellaire beach florida providing for amendments sections

with and providing an effective date this has been a second and final reading ordinance number 22-0 by title thank you very much uh before i open discussions on your motion do i have a second second what was the nature of the motion sorry that it was just i need a motion and then it was a motion this is a consideration of ordinance 22 dash rule one this is the second reading no i understand that i guess my finer point is the more appropriate parliamentary approaches to say a move to approve or move to pass oh it's another motion i understand and it's the same motion doesn't indicate what that motion is would you like to do is that yes thank you man sorry for the introduction so worried i said i'm sorry and who made the second wasn't very sure mr banker do you have this lord thank you mr mayor this uh was thoroughly discussed over a couple of work sessions and again at the last council meeting i believe the first reading was passed unanswered back to you [Music] thank you um other council members all right let's take it to the citizens we have maybe said some comments back to the council mr baker you have the last order all right before we do patty has this ordinance been noticed in publication yes sir thank you all right okay uh let's do a road call club council member baker yay i'm sorry yes thank you councilwoman ontario yes councilmember roberts yes council member shirley i'm council members able yes vice mayor gunn yes so it passes unanimously 7-0 uh thank you to everyone who worked on this and know what to do all right we are on to the consent agenda and uh we changed a couple of things but i think we'll get this right uh we're going to be discussing we're not discussing the passing items 9 10 11 and what used to be 13 that is now 12. so this is for approval of the may 2nd 2022 city council meeting minutes approval of may 5th 2022 special city council meeting minutes approval of may 16 2022 special city council meeting events and a proclamation designating june 15 2022 as world elder abuse awareness day do aye aye aye any opposed all right the consent agenda passes and we move on to item number 13. all right this is this is to authorize the city manager to execute assignment of the engineering services agreement and associates required by sepi incorporated the staff recommends continuation of the agreement before we do that driving motion by the way [Music] second [Music] this is a associates has been purchased uh by sepi engineering and we did the same thing and i did for when davis and christine was purchased by saltwater so uh i did send this to the city attorney uh previously and he said as long as the current agreement is what you do is we have a current contract that we can assign this so they're just asking for pretty much the same thing we did with songwriting just a execution of assignment any other comments for the council uh i had one of this tomorrow just curious if you've been able to look this over at all i i looked it over in as much as part of the agenda materials that have been circulated in advance of the meeting as a general operation in legal parliament say the acquisition of an entity by another entity in the sciences rights is very customary i spoke with the manager on friday concerning the agenda generally legal concerns one was not raised relative to thank this very much uh let's go to the citizens he says in comments back to the council all right let's take a look all in favor all right any opposed all right mr ruiz now we are on to item 14. this is consideration of appointment of the member to the planning and zoning board his name is our heart mcintyre and uh this is to fill the vacancy of one person on a five-member board there are currently only four board members and this board does not have alternates to begin with do i have a motion are you surely do i have a second all right uh it is my understanding that mr mcintyre was unable to attend tonight but just in case is he here oh all right well in that case uh email before we i don't have much to say i just we haven't heard anything it's probably it's probably been well over six months the last of the chair i uh i got to know mr uh max recently and i think it will be a great the lord and that he will encourage the members other than that let's go to the submitted comments all right let's go back to the council any comments okay uh seeing that there is only one candidate yeah yes ma'am oh vice mayor i'm sorry about that i'm still getting used to this little box over here now i guess my question goes to the protocol how i'm going to legitimize this process i guess i was informed with city clerk that there was some question about how you want to do this and because there was only one person the question arose whether there was going to be a vote for this or whether that person was just going to be like moving to the position so i guess i've given it some fun my my question is because people on boards and communities serve have a pleasure in council it [Music] because i think there are some future there may be some future possibility where one person is available to fill a vacancy and that person may not be the person with the qualifications or the temperament to fill that role so in order to avoid any future problems i think it's necessary of course to establish in precedence in this thing and say hey even if it's only one person we need to legitimize the process say yes that's the let me uh let me share my thoughts on that i did put some thought into it today and um i think it will have us covered with the method of voting that we're about to do which was i've been calling paddy for a roll call vote and that's where you have the option to say yes or no and we all know that it takes at least four people to uh to pass a vote so uh i think the system works i wasn't going to ask for them all in favor it was did you see something out of the ordinary or is it just because you're remote no i guess not just because i just want to make sure that the process was there you were going to have accountability to legitimize the process of everybody a majority appointee that's a landing okay and i will add that there was one uh that the next vote will go differently than the first vote the first vote is an easy one the second one is not so easy so uh but we'll go from there any of the other comments for the council if i may have to just address this procedurally the council member guns instincts are correct and your anticipated process is correct an applicant's submission for consideration absent any other contender doesn't entitle them to the seat this body is well within its right to to allow a vacancy to remain i'm not suggesting you should here but if it was your prerogative to say you'd rather have the vacancy than whoever has submitted um you need not necessarily establish precedent by your decision tonight but just doing so is perfectly appropriate the board members are appointed by this body and this body is not bound in its discretion thank [Music] you mr mr mcintyre has uh appointed what is our process to allowing him to let him know his disappointing and just call him and tell him so or is there a and you know and it's kind of an agreement that they understand that they could be religious your code is the contract that's really binding here if there's a contract to be having to characterize it that way but it's the binding governing document separately while i'm new to this position and many of my other communities as we get members all elected and appointed bodies as well i try to make an effort to set a time to meet with them to sensitize them to the ways their life has changed by becoming a public or semi-public official in the ways of the sunshine law and above the records law because a lot of your volunteers are accustomed to serving involuntary bodies in your community at large whether that's rotary or the chamber and they're used to doing things that are just per se not permissible we wouldn't want a new member to start creating problems inadvertently just by the deal by saying well i want to meet with the chair to talk about this new application next month and things like that so i i will it's my intention subject to staff's permission and use of resources in that regard to reach out to them and at least if not have a full-on meeting with them at least providing the materials for their review and consideration as they accommodate the position maybe you can reference their section i send them probably not a bad idea to uh maybe hand that literature off to everyone that serves on our boards so that they all understand and have already given the same information okay uh so uh let's do a roll call oh you mentioned earlier that you did mr mcintyre yes so you don't mind if you wanted to give you this application very thoroughly you can answer that any information that you may have or another council member or another person um a citizen that would that might help us a little bit did i miss uh why he's in here tonight you know what i've spoken with him whenever i was running for office and uh got to know him a little bit on both and seemed like a nice guy very knowledgeable very professional and i think that he would be a great asset as far as his qualifications uh i really didn't see anything in particular to our city but i did see the same new leadership let's see he has a very extensive uh 40 years in [Music] his professional life um i was impressed by the last section why would you like to be considered as a candidate for service on the planning and zoning group it was a trip to the piece of tranquility isolation through commercial infringement to protect and preserve the attractive qualities of our patient i think that's [Music] absolutely any other [Music] yes roberts yes yes yes thank you councilman shirley yes council members able yes vice mayor gun yes so that's seven to nothing and um to the planning and zoning board and uh we look forward to getting development better right now we are on to number 15 which is consideration of appointment of park and ranch recreation board member and an alternate board member we have two candidates uh um calling them out in the word that their application was received firstly is uh carolyn cormly and the second one is patty roberts all right this is to fill the vacancy of one person on a five-member board and one of the two vacancies for alternates there are currently only four board members and this board does not i'm sorry i'll put something off there all right so uh before we get started go out of motion what we're going to do is we're going to knock out both at the same time okay and i'll explain that but uh we can go ahead whenever i say consideration i may go both and so uh who made the first motion that was judy thank you uh any other clarification okay great so um uh miss uh you are here so if you'd like to speak please come on good evening mayor i'm city council i'm caroline cornelli i live at 2204 bayshore drive between 22nd and 23rd i've been serving on the board of adjustments for the last five years i've lived in the area now for six years and i really enjoyed getting to know some of the community members through my board activities and just being supportive of this great community i feel so honored to live here um the reason for me wanting to move into the parks and recreation board is i thought that was a much better fit for my skill set my background i've been in finance for over 20 years um and i've great planning skills so i'd like to lend my planning skills to the board and help manage the financial aspects so i really hope to be able to contribute in that capacity thank you first off let me apologize for this one second do we have any questions besides the finance i mean what are your thoughts for increasing community participation i think one of what stood out to me is for one of the last events that i live in the community i'm pretty active here i'm always running and i didn't even know about the event for the so i think we have to do um you know look at power advertising our events and to get your word out there are some signs and we're really helping our community outreach and how we get in touch with our community members so that we have greater participation and really understand what are the type of events that our community members would enjoy so by just looking at what we have good attendance on you know what are people giving us having communities to have any suggestion because of what they would like to see in the community or we are just getting the word finding out from our community members what what activities they would enjoy would help to increase participation [Music] any other questions let's go to the public record any questions all right back to the council okay uh i have one uh miss uh uh cornelli if you are not selected as a board member or are you willing to serve as an alternate yes thank you what is the differentiation does the ultimate still participate in all the meetings i believe any alternate uh has the option of participating but they would not be considered a voting member but if it's uh if the board or maybe is that right [Music] okay uh next up is miss roberts would you like to come up and speak while she's on her way you know i didn't know her a little bit she's been babysitting her grandchildren seven three and one all day today i did notice when i was tracking her she did stop off at a little club place so it was for medicinal purposes only so she's not speaking yes we can okay so now that he's introduced me [Music] so i'm happy robert i do have a connection with one of the board members i don't know if that makes a difference it should it will not to me i do want to serve on this because i'm an active person physically active i do not have the financial skills of this lovely lady that i met last week at the meeting but i am a very active person and i love recreation and outdoor activities so that's what my skill sets will be i'll plant flowers and big holes and he can tell you i'm the laborer at our house he's friends so um that's why i signed up for this committee because i really want to be involved i don't want him to be the only one involved in the family so um that's why i'm here thank you do we have any questions for the council yes um if uh put on the uh what would you like to see or what would your plans be well some of the things that i've already discussed with tammy and just people is i like christmas decorations and so i would like to beautify the place in that type of productivity the medians i would like to see more plants either flowers or other variegated plants in the medians and then on 22nd stream um anything to beautify there is and like i said i'm a get your hands dirty kind of person so i would be willing to volunteer to do any of those activities i'm not the beach between i didn't go this week because i was sick in bed so thank you any other chemical questions um okay so back to the council questions all right so uh thank you very much oh wait i did have one question for you i need to ask you the same thing if you are not selected as a board member are you willing to serve as long thank you mr roberts okay uh so uh uh patty has prepared balance um we're gonna do this a little different because uh vice mayor gunn is not here uh so we currently have clouds with with two columns and there's two names line one has uh miss cornell and line two has miss roberts first column is regular number second is alternate member uh whenever we take the vote uh you're going to put a y in whichever candidate or neither that you would like to vote for or the regular member and then you will do the same for the alternate number remember you are not required to check yes on either box but it does require a minimum of four votes for each candidate for them to be elected onto this board so in vice mayor gunn's case what you will have to do is just hold up your balance does that work for you yeah great great all right so uh does everyone have a ballot and so let's go ahead and vote so uh um [Music] [Music] you have to open [Music] sir okay it looks like one for miss cornelli on the regular regular member and um thank you [Music] councilmember baker miss cornelli for the alternate miss roberts for the regular council member otero miss cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the alternate councilmember roberts this cornelli for the alternate miss roberts for the regular mayor goddess ms cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the alternate council member shirley ms cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the algernon and council members abel ms cornelli for the regular miss roberts for the ultimate okay we have uh five to two on the regular uh for uh cornell and we have five to two uh for roberts on the uh alternate so uh cornell is the rainbow uh member and roberts is the ultimate congratulations to both and thank you so much for volunteering [Applause] all right we're on to item number 16 which is consideration of appointment an interim city manager here in the city manager search process first off do i have a motion and please clarify it's a move that doesn't work i moved to consider the appointment um the interim city manager do i have a second second all right boyd roberts knew that before the city manager has provided us with a recommendation which i think is wonderful the only question i had um then had to do with when does it actually begin how does it go into effect would we approve it tonight when does his additional pay again i'm planning on hitting the road on wednesday but and so i would think it would take effect then and then uh i am planning to come back for the budget workshop to put that out which i told you so but his increase would still stay in place yes it starts yeah and i'll just be as needed from that point okay get through the budget workshop any changes you're gonna get that we'll make sure that they're all updated and whatever then i'll be uh as needed i will be on vacation that that's i'm taking what you call a terminal vacation i would like to make a recommendation from one minor change and i spoke to mr reeves a little bit earlier tonight about this so currently listed as two thousand dollars per month i would like to um alter that slightly to say one thousand dollars per pay period every two weeks just to make it more rounded rather than have to multiply the two thousand dollars by twelve and divided by twenty six it would come up with some number you [Music] to do a wednesday well this is i mean we could do it effective today and that would be the start of the paper but i was like i said i'm leaving much more expense so today is the start of a day period yeah as a function of procedure sorry bringing more time turning i just want to make clear what the folks are doing pursuant to your charter in section 3.01 the city council by the majority vote appoints the manager of the town of the city once you appoint mr uh whomever you appoint whoever you're going and they become the city manager the they are the person vested with all the authority of that office and so while mr reeves has kindly offered donated however it's working out to be available returned to facilitate meetings and things that could see projects through upon his return that office doesn't change unless this body somehow changes it whoever assumes that office will have that office until you hire your next manager or otherwise remove that person from office and so just to be clear since there's this element of mr reason she doesn't ride back into the sunset i'm sheriff in it um you have your you have your manager and that's a fixed individual and that's so that there's predictability in operation thank you very much before before you took uh your position it was just the reason why the advisory council more than sid badger was you know mr john so he's coming back to help his rising advice and you and you folks and just again now getting back to procedurally where we were in the meeting i remember roberts had made motion uh member baker uh had suggested that a proposed amendment that motion does not get seconded um and so procedurally parliamentary procedure i don't know if you wish to clean that up before you or if you are amenable to that motion express then propose what i would like to do is i would like to hold off i know everyone wants to make motions but what i would like to prefer to do is hold off until we hear from mr parker and but let's uh kyle reefler the assistant city manager for the city of bellar beach i'm looking forward to having this opportunity if you guys see fit i'm excited to work with this wonderful city uh been working with mr reeves past two months getting familiar with everything i was not already familiar with and um during the time as a as an interim city manager i am confident that i can uh prove to you that i'm capable of uh for your consideration for the full-time position any questions i think we're blessed to have i mean you've been doing you've been doing the assistant for a year now right approximately approximately mr roberts angry gun i think uh to see interrogation concerned about this just want to make sure we know what we're doing because with my background there is just acting he has in the absence of the city manager but it kind of clears up this concern over the senior church but i'm going to look for him i think very appropriately the lower the same manager of assassins [Music] that correct all right and then i know we have to go with that one first so do i have a second on that motion second that was my table yes all right we have to take it to the citizens so any citizens like to comment on this [Music] any opposed okay so you just gotta raise and you're not even hired okay so uh there was a second notion she started at this period [Music] so we can uh do we have to put the start date on there or do we go ahead and go through this procedure uh generally speaking when entering and doing an employment agreement with the manager it's customary to have an effective date so you know again who has the authority at any given time and so you may wish you can and you can um you can set that for today it's a little complicated that you can do that just by the fact okay would you please make a motion and and list the date that you would like my motion is the effective date of this pay increase will be right now since the council voted next week so the first the first motion was to amend the current the current consideration for a point so what we're doing is we're adding some stipulations to that so now right now the motion is approved to do one thousand dollars per day period and now you're going to amend it as as soon as the council knows he goes effectively today all right so let's see if i got this right uh my advice would be that if you take effect immediately upon the conclusion of this meeting that's actually even better thank you because it's starting to get a little nicer and do we have a second home eurovision that's from leslie so now we have consideration of appointing an interim city manager during the city manager search process with an effective pay rate of one thousand dollars per pay period beginning or effective immediately following this vote can we change yet for lunch it's an increase it's not total it's an increase in 1 000 per year correct then i have to have some help writing this out so the motion on the floor mayor is as you stated to increase the compensation by a thousand dollars per pay period taking effect on the conclusion of this meeting is what i believe you have if i'm capturing properly your communication that's what i'm understanding the motion before it be it's already been a thousand eight years and setting this specific time is mr banker's motion on the floor that's been seconded correct okay do we have a second on that question yeah okay uh well first let's start with uh the comments from the council concerning the motion any this is actually consideration of appointing an interim city manager during the city of manchester's missing from this consideration is due correct we're not at that stage right structuring the agreement yeah vice mayor john do you have any comments i guess i'm not clear or when he leans that's the effective date of kyle what's getting out there and city manager so i guess i'm not quite sure why we're born here the guy poor guy hasn't even been in the office already gave them considerations because i i guess i'm not i'm not quite sure i think that's my own proof yeah which means he's out of the chair and the new city manager is for the interim so the good so the question is is is it going to be in manager effectively when we take this vote yes that's that's the motion on the floor people the motion one word to proceed to an individual emotional source or to operate in that function to the extent i'm pausing and i'm a little i'm not trying to reconcile because i'm learning a little bit on the fly and where you are my your your added concern here is um mr reeves is still an employee with vacation league that he intends to take and his employment title is man city manager if you unseat him from that position effective tonight um as the interim with an interim and no clear successor he is and are you you're not your aim is not to it's my understanding that it is not your aim to terminate mr reeves tenure um before he exhausts his leave and whatever else and so that's the and that was part of why i previewed you know you're putting something new in the seat um i don't i'm not presently aware of those exists i'm not aware of an agreement an independent agreement with mr reeves i would start today that would happen as an employee with always a contracted employee i don't know if this you know i don't know if he has an employment contract um my apologies i didn't i wasn't clear where this was going and what the anticipated procedure was but the challenge is and mr governments have been known if he's acting manager he has that authority however you have that you have somebody in the seat for example if in another one in another community i surveyed is established by resolution that if the manager is incapacitated for a period of time so and so is the person with all the authority but the moment they're back on scene and capable they still hold they never cease to hold that title and so the tension that we're trying to reconcile here is you have a manager who will still be on your payroll taking their entitled vacation leave as they generally downshift and off and off board but you do need somebody who will serve that function day-to-day while they're on that lead and that is customarily referred to as an acting manager um and acting is not it's not emphasis on acting like they're pretending and they don't know what they're doing it's they have the authority on sight they're at they're actively serving in that world and so that is i think the vice mayor was picking up on what i was afraid was going to have because it feels like this is in the case all the pieces are not there and is that does that sound correct to you is that is that kind of what you're picking up on is that the pieces can be there i i don't know that we've reached that point yet um and ultimately that's under the charter you are the body with the authority to appoint a manager and dictate how that position is filled or who is serving in it at any given time so you have the capacity to put those in however these issues should be reconciled so that you don't have confusion as to um you know where mr reef sits in his tenure relative to whomever you have serving in that role while he's traveling beginning wednesday and thereafter and the the timeliness has not actually given us the opportunity to hash these things this is a time-sensitive issue yes ma'am [Music] i didn't give you what i did i gave you your 60 days notice and i told the council that it's probably sometime in july [Music] i'll say third week of july which is what we were asking for and that's probably where there's some gray area because now we have we would have a standing interim and a standing city manager at the same time you can't do that your charter out contemplates one person holding that office and only one person and so that it is customary in municipal operation generally that in some communities it's mandated that there be a resolution on file who states who would be the manager in the absence of the manager but i'm not aware of a policy here in that regard but what i would say is at the very least in your business this evening i would suggest that you determine for any amount of time that manager reeves is absent from jurisdiction or otherwise incapable of fulfilling discharging duties who will be the person to serve that role whether that be for his three weeks of leave or if god forbid somebody gets it by a bus tomorrow you know what happens next and so in this case you can have an acting manager that would probably be your best course of action at this stage to have an acting manager while still allowing mr reeve to fulfill whatever benefit you would either at that stage have your interrupt or if it i know that you were also expressing some concern about timelines on improvement but if somebody's recruited before the end of july that's something else then you won't need an interim but if you don't conclude that phase then you would need an intro to get you from the end of july to whenever in august or september that you finally reach your final candidate so that that individual for example let's because the discussion is centered around this director and i don't mean to talk about youth like you're not the root um he could be acting through to use the parlance to do so far the end of july become interim at the end of july and then you hire somebody thereafter to be your manager without publication and there would be no conflict with our charter if we had an acting statement no it would actually i mean you should always know who the person is it's sort of a more succession player it is customary to have a who is who has all the authority of the office by decree of the council and mr reeves absence because if god forbid putting aside his anticipated retirement if mr reeves were to fall into a coma tomorrow you would want to know well who is who is going to i i know it's it's it's terrible but but it's it's it's important to know who operate and i will tell you i'm speaking from a place of experience in another jurisdiction that i represent in this in this county they went from a manager retiring to an interim manager that interim manager in turn resigned and then it was this and we had to keep saying that 11 59 on tuesday they cease to be the manager and the next manager will be constantly establishing and we went through about five in a year um you know in terms of succession and shifts and and and then even once we reach that final one it was okay if anything happens to you who makes the call or if you're stuck in mexico on vacation and without communication who makes that who who has the authority to say you're terminated because you've done something terrible in this town or yes sign that contract it's just succession planning much as we have for president vice president you know speaker et cetera and in our federal government and i know this has gone far afield of where you intended to be my apologies but i want to make sure you're you're executing precisely we're going to be more prudent we go back to the original plan and just change into gary's title to an advisor we need the memorandum except for the word changing for a thousand dollars fulfill is city manager duties the assistant city manager becomes the acting city manager so i mean if you want to all it would take would be a resolution doesn't name his assistant as the acting city manager in the absence of the greatest or a city manager sorry even at the point where then it means resignation becomes effective you still haven't had the same manager and at the end of the hiring process you get this name for the same managers and up until all you designated buddhistic and press kyle is the acting city manager with all the authority of the ingredients [Music] absolutely i appreciate that mr baker your point is well taken uh but however that's complicated by the fact that your sitting manager mr reeves has an employment agreement tonight and as i sit here now to reconcile that with a proposed course of action removing him from office and what would he be entitled to on the spot and it gets very very convoluted um and i'm not trying to remove the laws of trying to do a title change i i understand that but his employment agreement contemplates him serving with a specific type um and so that's that's the challenge i understand you're not trying to terminate them but it's what what recourse could we have etc my job is to consider those eventualities i would say your best bet is as a council you can informally vote to designate mr whoever mr reiffler sorry which one is that reflection mr riefler mr riefler as the acting city manager in the absence of mr reeves and that would be the simplest way in line with what council member governor suggested it's it's just you buy your vote you could establish who would be the acting manager it would be mr riefler and if you wish to set terms for that we can we can also take an agreement and retroactively apply it approved at a subsequent hearing as to what that compensation would be for added service in that role etc we can look at that but as far as most narrowly what you're trying to achieve tonight is ensuring that when mr reeves leaves on wednesday for what he's described as his terminal leave you know who's in charge and this body has the ability to do that by taking motion second and vote um and say and that would that would be that would i think effectuate the goal that you're trying to achieve here okay so would you be kind enough to give us give us the correct motion that incorporates everything that we're trying to accomplish tonight so that someone here can actually make that motion and we can move forward i also think it's a good idea to name the candidate in this in this motion particularly at this stage of the proceedings i agree with you mayor that's that's appropriate uh remember shelley for surely it sounded like there was something to say i work at your pleasure so you tell me how you like it seems pretty simple i mean i just would like to make a motion to appoint um kyle riefler as the actor and senior manager and the absence of mr lynn and also well i was discussing payoffs i was going to say and then also um in consideration for the end of dues a pay increase of a thousand dollars so emotion and the only question i would have when you sort of talked about it earlier so when mr reeves comes back into town he can't be bouncing back and forth like this that doesn't make any sense so he comes back to the town we're saying okay now mr reece is in charge that's going to be a very confusing denial he said in his acid so when he comes back into town he's not absent anymore right so who's the city manager in that instance most desirable approaches somebody ends on this day somebody ends on that day your complication here is really a complication as a result of an embarrassment of bridges and you have you have a manager who's who's retiring and willing to make themselves available on an ongoing basis while they reach their retirement date rather than say full stop don't call me lose my number after this day and so that we're trying to navigate that while balancing the needs excuse me of your form of government and so i agree with you that the complication there to me is not so much in who's in charge because it's very clear whenever he's whenever the man's in the building the man's manager uh but the the complication there is in as much as you start adding compensation to it and his compensation is based on when he's serving in that role and you know he's playing peek-a-boo with the role that kind of compact does complicate how do we establish what his compensation is so my strong recommendation to you at this stage would be to establish who is going to be in the role beginning which date and it can be acting the motion that you made is very close to what i would have said um and it would have been to to establish that mr riefler be appointed as the acting city manager in the absence of mr reeves until such time as mr reeves vacates the office or you otherwise hire somebody else that's basically what you're trying to achieve compensation and otherwise i think that there's still time with all due respect to mr riefler i don't i don't know what plans you've made in your life around this potential compensation but the that element may i don't know when this body is next to convene it sounds like we'll be convening sooner than later based on your manager recruitment processes anyhow and that can be addressed in a matter of a few weeks when you meet and backdated to hey he's been assuming this if we can find a way to clean that up and reconcile it with the informed knowledge of mr ruiz contract the empty manager agreement this is the responsibilities and duties so my [Music] the concise statement is take the motion mr ms shirley had made go with that um right up until there was a compensation element resolve compensation benefits and otherwise at a later date if need be but really for continuity of government which is my core concern for you as a community would be to handle that tonight and that only and deal with how people will be compensated and then that may give you time to also reevaluate what your current configuration is i'm not the chair so i don't know is there a way to word it so that um the effective date that we choose for kyle he becomes the um not the interim city manager but the acting and and he is in that role from that point forward so is there a way to work it in such a way that mr reeves from that point forward i'm sorry will never be considered the city manager for a couple reasons because i know from a council standpoint we would like the opportunity i know to and i know he's going to excel to evaluate kyle in this role full-time so while we're going through this process each one of the candidates obviously their short answer yes is there a way to do that yes it's basically the first half of our discussion right up until what's this complication the challenge the complication here is you have an employee who by all accounts you wish to to steward towards retirement and allow them the benefit of all of their group benefits and otherwise and that takes time and what you don't have in this moment is time and so my challenge for you is how are you going to reconcile the interests of this is not a situation where you're terminating a manager because you're done with them you're through with them and we need to irreconcilable differences usually in those scenarios it's very clean after this meeting you mean right in the middle of the meeting you leave you you come up and you sit here that's not what you're trying to do you're you know and that's and i'm not i don't suggest you are but if you make it such that mr riefler is the manager effective tomorrow at 1201 am then to the extent mr reeves has an employment contract that entitles him to compensation benefits leave approval etc how do you reconcile that with the fact that he doesn't actually have an office in your city anymore all right and so i'm trying to balance those interests by saying the best way to do this is your functional placeholder making him acting and if that gives us time to reevaluate maybe we enter into a separate agreement with mr reeves to reconcile that that will make this cleaner down the road and my my duty is as much as i respect and enjoy working with mr reeves my duty is to use the body if this body feels to realize like you know what i didn't quite appreciate that this worked that way we can talk about a different voluntary separation agreement or anything else but in the here and now and again i'm not suggesting mr reeves easily i'm trying to balance all your interests and present you the of options before you the the here and now option that is most viable is the emotion on the floor that does not have a second which is that mr riefler served as the acting city manager for the city of bellar beach upon the absence of mr reeves from the jurisdiction or basically that's the question basically in his absence mr riesler serves and when he returns then mr reeves is vested without authority until such time as the other was departing him or the city council takes some action that is not consistent with him retaining the time is it is it smart to list mr reeds exclusively or is it an absence of city management and that way we actually do have a backup city manager in the event that someone else is hired for that position big picture i would ordinarily say yes but given your current landscape not really and it's my understanding that mr riefler music may well be one of the candidates for that office yeah and so in the in the event he were to ascend to that and there's no presumption that he would um you've not really achieved anything and so i would say that your better bet is to just address the here and now and not try we can put it in and trust me after the conversation we've had i'm not going to forget this you know getting getting a procedure in place for that going forward once we get to a permanent manager it may well be a resolution that we do right after we approve the contract for that individual um and then deciding who those people or persons would be in order um but in the here and now i think your your motion member shirley's motion on the floor is the most appropriate motion for you to consider absent any reference to compensation all right make sure would you please uh repeat your motions yes my motion is to appoint kyle riefler as the acting city manager in the absence of mr lynn reeves comments well mr roberts brings out a good point about it is he in the chair or not in the chair and i think the two of them weren't mr agrees actually i'll appear i don't think there's only any conflict but i like what mr robert said about you want to evaluate this man so how are you really evaluating if well i don't think that it hasn't been an issue to this point i know lynn's um agreed to help us through budgeting i think that's a good opportunity for kyle to learn from lynn what the budgeting process is so i think that uh i think you guys are reading too deep into this kyle has the authority unless glenn is in the building and you know but i don't see lynn coming in and going kyle sit down and shut up i'm taking help i i agree with you maturely uh and specifically what you just stated that we're going to evaluate here that's unfair to all the other candidates we can't be doing that well the only the only question and i have to agree with mr banker that it plainly says in absence so he's no longer the acting city manager in the absence of city manager reads so he walks in the door you're you're no longer the acting city manager that's my problem vice mayor i was just like saying it's i don't i think this thing and this acting really clears it up a lot and i don't see lynn coming to make decisions on the spot right now because i'm i'm fully employed taking care of the budget you know he can do that just about anytime stella need his responsibilities outside i think we're we're concerned about too much here and i think this is the most robust solution we're going to develop and i'm all employed in support of my council member service motion okay no i've not found the specific language of a delegation as standard practice if you wish to clean it up yet further the motion could be in the absence or declared unavailability of manager of liberties in that way if mr reeve's presence alone is the location you could say i'm here but i'm considerably unavailable that's the only other thing i can offer to you as a and i'm not trying to be the dancing about this i'm trying to respond to your feedback and quell your concerns um so your other option could be to be in the absence or to clear out availability of the manager then that would address the hey yeah i'm in the building but like i'm not here to answer questions i'm not here to do stuff i came to pick up a pen i left i'm not trying to make official decisions um that would be the closest i think we could get to reconciling each party's concerns tonight with an understanding that i i do think this matter may likely need to be revisited in the near term would you call it declared available declared unavailability and then that way that gives explicitly the it's in the absence of clear unavailability you got a motion in a second so um they would have to express the desire to amend their emotions but um if if you go that route that leaves no doubt that lin has the authority to the ability to seek that and his your presence while his mere presence may trigger it he can also then functionally decline would you like to retract your second lashing for extra motion yes that's fine or i'll move to the middle okay with the emotion and my motion is to appoint kyle griefer at rietler as an acting city manager in the absence for declared unavailability of mr lynn reeves do i have a second yes why would we not want to go in and put the conversation in there now that we kind of addressed that compensation wasn't it the reason that i'd offer that i'd suggested that it complicates matters is to the extent mr reeves can have his election and presence assume the office are you then not compensate today where we i don't have an employment agreement i don't have all these other documents that i want and i don't know how your payroll works are you going to then prorate mr riefler's compensation by minus 24 hours of that one week and minus 36 hours i don't think so but you you could do it but then they're not really being compensated for the services you could do it it's your prerogative it's just i could see just as easily as you say as far as i'm attorney should have it for as long as he's available to serve that office and you could certainly do that um i was trying to not eat the elephant one bite at a time right let's determine who's going to be in there and what they're and then if you wish to resolve that you can but my complication was then if one person says well i'm not comfortable using those funds during that time to compensate down he's not really holding the title and so i'm trying to balance based on the feedback and comments i'm hearing trying to reconcile that and say the first fight is who's going to occupy the office and when let's figure out who and when and we can retroactively resolve for what for what compensation um if we still desire if you wish to i would say my advice to you would be do that first and if you wish to talk about conversation compensation you can have that conversation next but at least decide who's going to be assuming the office the moment mr reeves starts driving away from the jurisdiction any other comments before i go to the citizens no citizens yes sir john hansen 103 22nd street i lost track of the number of times she beat this poor ocean death i really am the motion as it's made right now makes sense the one thing that is totally complicated your decision process you don't have an actual date that the current city manager is retiring he's given you a 60-day notice he's given you an agreement which you've agreed to make available for assistance down the road with the budget and so forth now there are two of us physically in this room and one remotely with military experience and i'm going to give you an example terminal leave prior to discharge or retirement you have so many days on the books you know when your last day is the question to you is and to us the citizens when is this last day if you had that information decision process much simpler much quicker and a whole lot less complicated thank you very much anyone else yes i certainly appreciate all the time you've taken tonight to discuss this and make sure it all desired out so it's correct um another idea might be for then to go ahead and leave on the aid and you guys give him a severance package to pay him for all of this vacation time that he has come and that way kyle could go ahead and take over as the interim and that would resolve all of that but it's an idea to go ahead and give people a service package that's always there thank you thank you many other citizens back to the council is that last comment workable uh that you i'm sure you're staying on health benefits with the city utility and and the other economy from the citizens about we should have a hard day well i can do that with a calendar but so if we gave you a severance package and we've already approved your travel expenses coming back and everything like that would that not clean everything up here the short answer is yes severance package is being described i would call it a severance agreement would clean that up and that's sort of what i've very vaguely been referencing throughout this is you may wish to revisit you you as a council may wish to revisit if this arrangement this sort of semi-formal arrangement works best for you however if you decided and mr reeves was amenable to it you could talk terms and see if an agreement can be mended out that that memorializes a specific end date compensation how his leave and benefits would be handled that's not something that you're going to have at this days this evening at least on my advice i would not advise you do so until such time as again your legal counsel has the benefit of seeing what is he entitled to in his current employment agreement what does your insurance provider provide about coverage for somebody depending on what what his status is and those sorts of those those factors all go into a efficient and effective severance agreement so that we don't leave anything undone and unresolved because if we try to do it on the fly invariably it will be something we missed that will one subject you do heightened criticism for this process and also to not fully memorialize what what you would have done with the ability to prepare and so there may be there may be value in reconvening this month or or early in the next month to address that but in the here and now tonight i think your motion on the floor is adequate and you and you folks can rule over whether or not that needs to be addressed in the next day [Music] as long as you need and if everyone's ready we can take the vote of they raise this absence or declare synapses then then kyle wrinkler is acting sick manner very clean and uh we deal with the uh bonuses later i agree okay all right if everybody's satisfied with this motion we will move forward and take a vote this is for appointing kyle riefler as acting city manager in absence of city manager rays or declared unavailability councilman roberts yes council member shirley i'm councilmember yes councilmember baker yes councilwoman otero yes vice mayor gunn [Music] and we now have an acting city manager [Applause] all right next do we need to uh address the compensation uh and uh if so would someone like to mention motion to address the compensation and i have more specifics i'd like to make a motion with acne the new acting city manager to address his compensation to increase it one thousand dollars uh i believe since council voted to give him the responsibilities of this great city and acting city managers and t-series conversation roberts i would like to further define a thousand dollars per pay period there's 10 days in a pay period right 14 but we don't get paid if we divide it up in 10 working days that equates to 100 per day very simple number but we made it 100 per day and on particular times mr reeves returned that would be a simple mathematical equation so let's say in any particular week you're back one day that was four hundred dollars for that week something like that but it could if somebody's concerned about that fact that mr reeves comes back into town and he's now the city manager it's a very simple round number unless we're confident that we're never going to have that scenario where you're going to be now the city manager again you're always going to relinquish that option as long as we're good on that then we just leave it a thousand dollars a day period or something so can i propose something um i think this is going to take a little more thought that we can we can do sitting at this document i think we need to review enter into an agreement contract with kyle we uh this one again often gets paid i don't think this is something that can be done we agreed to as long as he's acting city manager this is his compensation period it doesn't matter whether lynn's in town or not in town that shouldn't matter um so there's and that's a good reason why we need to kind of put some thought into this and maybe have the attorney present us a employment contract plus we need to look at lynn's employment at the same time so i would i would propose that we have a meeting we talk about setting up another meeting right now uh all right let's take a look this is a motion to table the motion to increase uh acting city managers pay uh one thousand dollar per page detailed further discussion uh patty could you please call councilwoman ontario um councilmember baker no council members abel hi councilmember shirley i'm at the member robert yes yes yes my spear gun hi here guys so the motion of the table passage we will address this soon uh i anticipated a work session and some sort of an emergency um to approve this compensation okay we got that out of the way item 17 this is to authorize the city manager to execute an extension of the code enforcement special master memorandum of understanding extend the mou for an additional two years at 175 per hour do i have a motion joey surely do i have a second president um [Music] any other discussion let's go to the citizens oh let's mention back to the council uh briefly how many hours have been paid for uh she's she's on my uh code here basis uh actually i think we did a check for her today it was like 450 dollars so it's sporadic as an example if we have a uh let's see what was the most recent quarter quote hearing it was a short term and i think it costs yeah because i was concerned about the 25 or an hour increase but it's not 40 hours a week oh no no no no i i mean i could send you an email with what she was compensating last year the original time she started as our co-administrators i any opposed all right 7-0 disagrees you're all prosperous chief extension all right let's see now we go to unfinished business does anyone have any on advanced business well okay um the only thing that i have right but mr gunn did you have anything i'm sorry the only thing that i have right now is the total weight zones we discussed total weight zones and and i spoke to randy about that and he did send us some information uh the total weight zone issue really lies with feller shoulder because that's the area we're talking about and randy can give us in the broadest sense as we talk about toway zones the issue that comes from whose property my understanding of the beach accesses that were of concern the beach access is the property is owned by another shore at least in the areas that were particularly concerned whether the city or town has the ability so it depends on the actual owner record of the contemplative parking areas additionally there may be they'll need to be appropriate signage police vehicle owners will notice that they are in a towing zone how to reach the company that moves other vehicle given that both communities rely on ps and pcso my advice was also to inquire with pcso if they have any sop standard operating procedures or legal considerations associated with towing for public property we would likely be directing that but your code enforcement is handled by pcso and pcso says oh we don't like doing that we're not willing to do that that creates an i'm not suggesting they look but there come times where municipalities want the sheriff's office to do something and they say we're not comfortable proceeding in that fashion so no and so we need to make sure that that i doubt that would be the case that we should have that dialogue as well and finally the communities need to consider their respective purchasing guidelines concerning the procurement of the contractor to handle towing if it is decided that they want to go in that direction so if it is in fact dollar stores property that's the only place we're coming from fellow short hasn't closed about that if they have procurement guidelines that require them for a contract of xml to go out to bid or do invitation events or something like that just doing that and keeping those procedures as well i think it would be more of a mutual understanding i understand what you're saying it's their property so they would have to do the contract with the company and make sure that law enforcement agreed with the procedure we certainly we have our own we have our own laws also and going back to the conversation with bel air store that the last conversation that i had with them was we were trying to to come to some type of terms that would benefit both communities so that we need to work together and make life easier for us and make life easier for them they agree that they want to be neighborly with us and they also understand that there are some abuses that are going on their property so one of the things that i opened up and discussed with them was what can we do to help and their two biggest complaints weren't really obviously because there's no umbrellas right now the two biggest complaints that they had was people abusing their property trespassing and just pretty much neglecting their their the bellar shore beach so the conversation that i had with him was well what can we do and i think usually we agree that we should increase the up and down the beach i did mention that we had an erosion problem and that the putting the big cruisers on the beach was probably not the best idea uh so that was one uh one avenue he uh went down and the other one was parking parking access and who actually goes there well uh if the sheriff's department is patrolling once a shift and they have to not go by during sunset or uh after sunset until maybe just before they're probably missing the the peak opportunity to get the most traffic also we hear the education i also heard that at the bellar shore meeting but i think both communities as a whole i think that if we agree that people are just ducking in there they don't have a sticker they don't have permission they have nothing to do with anybody in either one of our municipalities um they're trespassing and so i think that they're on board with um with contracting with a towing company and trust me a token company has an opportunity to make money so they would swoop in there and every time they saw a car and they would throw them away and that would be the end of that um these are these are all things that we're starting to discuss so at this time i haven't really haven't had a huge discussion with the council now that's more of a fact-finding mission to see what could be done and you got the answer for me and so in the next work session that's what we'll be addressing is how do we how do we do this if we want to move forward i can assure you that our store will go along with this look whatever it is that we need and it's their understanding all they need is some signs that say it's totally zoned and somebody shows up and doesn't belong there totally i'm going to turn them all over and take the car away they'll only do it one time and so that's that's where we're at right now as far as as far as the the uh topic that you brought over the umbrellas uh unfortunately right now we're still in spelling and it has to do with um with a lawsuit and two very strong entities and it's that i don't think that there's really anything that our community community can do except we're continuing to extend that without that branch and see if we can break them down and i think that we're making progress i see your names do you have any comments yeah i i think the conversation the mayor and i had was a good conversation i will tell you that i did contact the sheriff's office and ask them to do more directed patrols on the beach so hopefully they're doing that if they're not and we'll check into that a little further but i i think it's a positive step a couple other things we talked about electronic gaits we're going to do some research on that actually we started one company i think it was in prayer or something like that that we were talking to so the towing was brought up to review the problem is is now you have to legally provide every resident in lrb with something to get them in the gate and now it becomes cost prohibitive because let's just say that you know every remote is 75 per household and you want two or three of them because you have two or three thoughts and you won't want to walk around with it so you can get in a small gate all of a sudden the costco's weighed up for the town of delaware short it's not that much because they don't have that many residents but for the city of delray beach it was a huge expense and so that's why i kind of shied away from the the access gates because it just it doesn't seem practical but that would certainly solve most problems so just just today and talking to a couple of people that are supposed to talk with commander they're concerned about the uber drop pulse uh just today two electric bikes came on at 6th street another you know and i can't think of all we have is a clear word club or whatever they haven't gained access there it's a punch game which can't be that expensive um well the problem with that is that whenever you have a population the size of lrbs that's a lot of shared access you're absolutely right but it i think it would drop i think we minimize some of it it's not going to it's it's cheaper is what i'm saying and now that through the gates or whatever what i'm saying is if you're going to build that relationship um i think the parking is minimal yeah i think it's uh it just starts with baby steps something like that that both municipalities can agree upon and then you grow relationship and uh and work together and little by little i think that we'll get over this but yes it's taking some time and uh it's it's uh very unfortunate but there were there was a uh unfortunate chain of events that occurred on the onset of coca and uh suddenly tampa is down here deploying our beaches and destroying things and our furniture and swimming in people's pools and partying on our sea walls and it wasn't just fair it was up here some too uh so it's just going to take some time to repair the damage and that's the best answer any other unfinished business nope council member or advice without mayor john no all right so uh now we have council comments since uh since i tried the last time to leave him out this month we're going alphabetically and i'll council member thank you uh the only comment i have is 78 years ago today thank all those who download any other comments uh council member all right uh council member roberts yes the uh somebody mentioned about the left-hand turn issue that we have up here right down the street at our last workshop um i asked the council if i could kind of take the lead on that which i'm going to do they all approved it i do have a copy of the traffic study that was done by pinellas county they actually outsourced it mr reeves gave me a copy of that it's about 12 inches thick which is wonderful but i do have some experience and knowledge in that area so i am going to pursue that i strongly believe that there are better options and my lead question to the county is going to be tell me what we can do in order to have the left turn signal returned i already know what some of their answers are going to be but that's going to be my objective to get that left turn and say go yellow turn signal back well we have the option because we've all lived through that we've come up to that light and now we have a red light and there's no traffic on the other side and we're sitting there before which seems like a day i'm sure it's only 60 seconds but it's still very very frustrating so that's going to be my goal to get to get that fixed and it was one of those things yeah i'm all in favor of the parking tickets for the 6th 12th and 19th street parking area i appreciate the officer who's talking about education i think the best education is give them a ticket have them pay the fine and then they'll be much smarter than next time so very quickly this is a big issue for me um this council recently approved the 12th and 13th street um stormwater project i went home that night and i actually had difficulty sleeping because i know i was elected as all of us were to represent all the citizens of this county actually this did a family who's sitting back there now when i left that meeting to vent so i could somehow get rid of that and went home i laid in bed until one o'clock in the morning i got the remote control i turned on the television and watched top gun for the first time for two additional hours the problem is the following this council dropped the ball we are sitting in a position where we could potentially waste 250 000 conservatively of our taxpayer dollars i'm sorry that's the only way to say it and the reason is let me tell you there's only like three or four different things that are happening with these alcohol pipes you have a high tide and no rain historically the city has witnessed problems where the salt water back flowed through the pipe and onto the streets kudos to the city city manager and team have alleviated a lot of those problems by putting check valves on the end of those alcohol pipes beautiful we also have the scenario still where there's a high tide and a new drain event that water cannot get out of the streets because the check valves are going to close and even if there won't check valves there because of the head pressures involved that water could not get out good news is the water that's going to be sitting in your streets is fresh water not salt water that's all good you're also going to have a low tide with a big rain event that's when there's no issue at all the water goes down the drains into the pipe without the outfall no problem so that's not a problem a quick timeline on may the 2nd we had a council meeting where this was brought up for the first time and we decided to table it because there were so many questions asked about it that was followed up by a workshop on may the 16th we spent a lot of time discussing the 12th and 13th street project and the decision was made at that time i just listened to the audio again today to move forward to reject the project then i had a special council meeting on 6 1 which was last wednesday walked into the meeting all of a sudden it wasn't rejected people had changed their vote and it wasn't rejected so it was actually voted at that point to move forward with the contract and that project again i will say we're missing the opportunity to review this the biggest question was what is the condition of the current reinforced concrete pipe that's under the ground we have not done our job by building those those pipes to determine what condition they're in i just read about a city i think it was in wisconsin where they decided they had 85 year old pipe they decided to remove it when they removed it they were like wow this pipe is in excellent condition is what they determine so they kept that light that they took out of the ground they're going to reuse it potentially on projects down the street the army corps of engineers has articles talking about reinforced concrete prime can be good for over a hundred years yet we're choosing to take it out it doesn't make any sense because at the end of the day as i ask the engineer on this job will that improve these other scenarios i described and the answer is no it's not going to happen we're going to see the same problems which begs the question why would we spend that additional money in order to see the same issues and i'm still unbelieving as to how the votes change from the workshop to the last special meeting and that's what we are and it we're taking taxpayers dollars and not spending it properly that's the part that makes me uncomfortable that's our job our job is to determine the best way to spend the money we have we have a finite amount of money and we need to spend it correctly period thank you council member shirley just a couple of comments there are a lot of people here wanted to address the buoys i'm not sure that they're aware of a letter that was sent and they draft as as i'm told again this was during the work session so that might change but this was a letter that had to be sent to fwc so that we were now brought into compliance that we have a plan in place it doesn't mean that we have to proceed with the plan council has not voted on again this was just a holding a cardholder basically that received so they would not find us so that's to those that look like everyone left that was asking those questions but to address that and then secondly my second point is back to the drainage issue that mr roberts just discussed i unfortunately was not here for that special meeting that was called but when we left the work session we all agreed that we were going to have uh cameras run into the pipe so we can get a complete picture of what we were dealing with on this drainage project and the fact that we voted on something that we didn't do our diligence on is really disgusting to me because the council would move forward with a vote that we all agreed we would do some homework on and see what needs to be done the fact that it passed it's just uh shameful that our council agreed to pass that and that's all i'm going to say i hope in the future that we don't uh act so quickly to move forward with something we're getting hit with huge increases and we should have taken a closer look at it council members are able i would uh basically add to that if you're complaining about that you should be here for the vote but otherwise thank you uh casper member baker for remembering our media veterans thank you that's all i have vice mayor god two things one is this remote access from my perspective is working wonderful i can hear you guys i'm seeing so focused up on the audio vision secondly why is it that the two engineers in his collegial body is having problems sleeping in this 12th and 13th street priority i am in total agreement with everything that boils down and especially joey sherman [Music] if you go back to the minute council member robert suggested to table the item for review to ensure that the benefit of the project is given to the cost we we all pretty much rolled in on that when we came back and then the next thing that happened to my expectations were that we were going to do some due diligence we were going to chamber the pipes we were going to go overnight and look at the cost benefit of this project the explanation and prices to consider the budget internet with respect to a comment that was made and to avoid analysis from analysis there was no analysis between the time that we tabled that in the time that we had a special need there was no discussion there was no further analysis of this thing whatsoever i was as surprised as anybody when i saw nothing getting done i just sat down full report so people could at least see what the basis of the initial importance and it was all simulation it was all based on outdated design or system but there was no objective analysis of the condition of the pipes or their old problem and said hey is it not being designed problems small alcohols [Music] nothing [Music] there was no analysis no perfect discussion that just happened and i'm sad by that process if nothing else happens we need to monitor this project because as we start getting up little cars we should be we should be uh archiving the status of those pipes and then condition and structural genuineness products so then further down in the room you don't make the same mistake [Music] we spent time talking about uh detail let's pour it out and talk about uh christmas preparation we're talking about a 35 increase in employment two hundred thousand dollars and we when we okayed this even before we got into the budget remove process you know [Music] horse cars or something that happens here we haven't even talked about the strategic plan what are the relevant issues what what were the priorities what we obtained a [Music] thank 200.000 thank you vice mayor um let's see i've been made aware that the tourism development council may be able to help the san diego beach nourishment uh project uh i also spoke with mayor jim welch at the mayor's council uh he actually serves on that council and uh told him that we were in dire straits and uh we're one of the lucky ones and we still have a beach but there are many communities south from here that they have little of nothing left their beaches are eroded we've lost according to mysteries we've lost half of our beach already so i made a point to pull him off to the side and get his attention on this and plan on sending him a letter along with other mayors holding the burst strings about 300 million dollars this could be resolved and it would still require easements to do the nourishment project however it would not require a perpetual reason it would only take a one or two year impeachment that i'm certain that most of the people that are unwilling to sign these easements they would sign it on a two-year plan knowing that they would get their property back at the end of the project so i'm working on that to see what can be done and if the county is willing to work with us if we can get the tourism development council on board i believe that they will have no problem persuading the county commission to approve this but we have to keep working and we'll see what happens uh let's see here again i'd like to thank everyone for coming out tonight i also like to thank kyle um vice mayor guns already brought it up the new audio system is incredible uh for patty uh she told me that we were at least up to 2019. no i'm just kidding great job great job and uh do i have a motion to return questions floyd roberts all right all in favor all right i have any opposed good night everyone recording stuff"
