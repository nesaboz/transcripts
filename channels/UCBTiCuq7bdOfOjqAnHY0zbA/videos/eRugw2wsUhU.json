    "transcript": "good evening everyone it's now 5 pm and the june 20th special council meeting will now come to order please rise and join me in the pledge of this is the allegiancy for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all penny would you please call enrollment council member frank banker council member leslie otero here councilmember lloyd roberts councilman jody shirley councilmember mike sable here vice mayor glenn gunn here mayor dave gattis city manager lynn reeves and city attorney randy mora president thank you patty we have four very important items on the agenda this evening let's get started with item one this is a proposed voluntary separation agreement for land reads first off do i have a motion to accept the proposed separation agreement motion made by leslie notorio do i have a second sec second by frank baker leslie you have the floor um i've read this over i was you know randy obviously has written this thing and i'm assuming that glenn has reviewed it and i see nothing i see it like it covers everything and if i may remember remember doterra just to give you all folks a little bit of a reminder and the genesis of how we got here and how this document came to be earlier this month on the i believe it was the sixth we had a meeting during that meeting there was some discussion of appointing mr riefler as the acting versus interim manager during which there was extensive discussion one of the the resident points through that discussion have been that while member pardon me manager reeves had provided for a leave date with terminal leave and there had been an addendum executed to his employment agreement just before i joined that contemplated him serving as a consultant thereafter the precise time period was amorphous and that was creating some confusion on when would kyle be the manager without any potential switch kyle has been the acting manager since the wednesday after that meeting but as evidenced by this big numbers mr reeves is here he is the manager president so while the terminal leave um approach was was generally agreed upon the the resident i wouldn't say consensus but there was at least a thematic discussion in the room that we needed definitive dates and definitive approaches and so as a proactive approach as your town attorney your city attorney i drafted this document before i drafted it i confirmed with mr reese say we have a few options based on how the discussion at this meeting went are you interested in exploring any of these that included whether that would be a voluntary separation agreement creating a position an employee position within the org chart which the manager would have the authority to do um and then and so long as there were allocated funds or some other permutation thereof he was open to this approach and said you know he's really just trying to receive the benefit of the bargain that he made with the city in terms of his compensation while also agreeing to continue on and there's a separate agreement that we'll discuss in that regard and speak after i learned this manager reeves was open to that exploration of a proposal and that's what you have before you this is a proposal this is not a foregone conclusion you are the council this has to do with the manager this is expressly within your authority i did have a discussion with the mayor the next day after that after that same hearing in part because i'm newer to this position to say what went right what went wrong in ways of our dynamic as we learned to work with each other and because there was an extensive discussion asked if he was interested in exploring any potential or having me do any work in that regard he was open to it and so i prepared this document this document is based on templates i've used in other communities not not chapter and verse because you have to make everything align with the particular facts i want to be very clear there were no back door negotiations or additional negotiations i had circulated this to manager reeves last week to say before i circulate to the council are you generally amenable to this um so that i don't circulate to them that's something that's a non-starter pursuant to section 2-52 of your code of ordinance is the manager is authorized to call a special meeting and so upon or the mayor is authorized to call a special meeting upon reviewing the proposals we discussed and the ideas of for this council to consider the mayor was comfortable and interested in calling this meeting and that's how we got here so there has been no the mayor was not negotiating with lynn i there was no this is for you to consider this is a proposal so i want to be very clear about that i know there's been some concern in this community in the past on the origin or genesis of proposals that the council considers so i want to address that that said what this separation agreement intends to do is to functionally put manager reeves in the same position he would have been under the approach that had been discussed with terminal leave going into the end of july when i asked manager reese to calculate the time he had he said it would take him through somewhere between july 29 and august 1. july 2009 is the final friday in july and so i counted at the end of a pay week and so i calculated everything and working with your financial consultant is heather guadagnoli with us and associates and provide and provided the numbers so the as far as the compensation goes um when you're you really want to be looking at section two uh sub a is to pay him pursuant to the personnel manual what leave he's entitled to that would be a hundred percent of any vacation they've accrued 25 percent of any sick leave with which there's roughly um 12 days of 11 or 12 and that would turn out to might be about three days items um items c and d kind of go into the timeline for that payment item c goes into the timeline for that payment the next item on there is item b um as additional consideration and in particular for granting the employee um mr means would get three a three thousand dollar payment that is not a windfall payment it serves multiple purposes um in the law for any agreement or contract to be binding between parties there has to be what's referred to as consideration you have to offer an acceptance with something bargained foreign exchange in this case manager reeves is giving the city a complete waiver and release of any claims he may presently have against the city i'm not representing to you that he intends to litigate or has expressed the desire to litigate it's a think of it as insurance and certainty it's giving certainty through this process further remember reeves is not our manager reeves i'm sorry i just keep seeing a member of everyone manager reeves does not receive his health insurance through the city he receives a stipend of approximately 600 a month for this this would allow him to continue in that regard briefly and also he had planned some other medical appointments uh for which he is provided dental vision etc and this would make provisions so if there are out-of-pocket costs it gives him some some reasonable expectation to address those as he had planned to do during his terminal leave process so it is not a windfall payment it is it is to put him in a position similar to that which he would be in the final provision is provision e in that compensation which contemplates contributions to mr reeve's retirement account and uh a one thousand dollar payment to his 401 a in the 500 to his 457 those numbers were based on had he served through the end of july as he had fully intended and committed to do that's the amount of the contribution the city would have otherwise made so to use common parlance this is akin to a buyout agreement with an added kicker of a exchange of a release and that's really all this puts mr reeves in the same financial position he would have been had he stayed on for july and allows and the terminal date on this would be this friday at 5 pm and then as a separate agenda item we'd be discussing who would be appointed as the interim manager as a 501 pm and at that point there will be no question who is the manager should something happen that person would be appointed until such time as you otherwise removed them or appointed someone else and there would be no acting dynamic which was another concern that the body had so that's the genesis of this i know this was a little long-winded but given that it was a special meeting called i wanted to make sure there was and i hadn't had a chance to speak with each of you wish to make sure you had a complete understanding and i'm happy to answer any questions you may have on how this occurs thank you mr moore any questions or comments from the council yes vice mayor just a question this scenario is cost neutral to an acting situation all the numbers that you provide if he went the acting route where kyle assumes his duties is active which is provided for the new job description number 12. yes sir and or you say hey he terminates friday at 5 pm and these are the numbers we compensated it's cost neutral it is i i can't tell you to be sent that it is cost neutral it is i i use the term functionally cost neutral that nominal payment of three thousand dollars does account for uh what would probably be there's a little bit more than that i couldn't tell you to the dollar and cent but it is functionally cost neutral i would say there's a nominal payment in exchange for the waiver that was specifically contemplated all other terms beyond that three thousand dollar payment are cost neutral yes sir because i understand what you're trying to accomplish here many people aren't as secure as the ex-military guys are because the military always has a guy in charge you always know who's an authority who who has the full weight and authority of the commanding officer terminally people are coming and going all the time so it's not a it's not something new to us so i understand if everybody's more comfortable going that way that's fine but if it's cost neutral that's that's my question do you even have either what you want thank you mr gun another council member mr banker does mr e have a contract with us yes he does when does that expire so it doesn't as written it doesn't it is evergreen and then it has an addendum on it that had him giving a retirement notice with terminal leave during which time he would continue to accrue benefits as as paid here and the calculus in speaking with mr reeves as the manager was his terminal leave would take him through the end of july but it does not have a absent disagreement he would cease to be an employee of the city around july 29th august 1st is it on the evergreen does the evergreen have a renewal date or does it just have i don't remember that off hand because it was superseded by the addendum executed you already have to get a notice of discharge under the addendum there is 10 days notice to either party to to terminate him as a contractor at 60 an hour otherwise he has voluntarily announced that he intends to separate at the end of july because this is an at will employment service absolutely so he looks i don't want to take a dime from you you deserve everything you get i gave you six thousand instead of three now but what i'm saying is i'm a guy who does collective partying all my life if god bless you if you get a contract i'll vote for any other council members let's go to the uh before we go to the citizens mr reeds are you satisfied with and willing to accept this agreement yes thank you let's go to the citizens for comments so let's go back to the council with uh council member of the toro having the final word nothing else all right in that case let's take a vote if the council accepts agreement and waiver this is bringing away where it will be effective on friday june the 24th at 5 00 pm all in favor any opposed okay the motion is approved mr reeves thank you for your many years of service now let's move on to item number two which is appointment of interim manager upon separation of lynn reeves currently kyle reever is the acting city manager when city manager reads is unavailable i would like to propose that we appoint kyle riepler to become the interim city manager effective june 24th at 501 pm until a new city manager is hired i'll second that do i have a motion question motion by frank banker all second second by mike disable all right mr banker do you have the floor i believe kyle is the perfect choice for interim consumer managers as expressed in march i had to contact him yesterday unfortunately on father's day i appreciate it bang right out there to help the citizens i don't think we could ask for a better guy other council members no let's take it to the citizens would anyone like to speak all right let's go back first let's go to uh mr ripler would you like to address the council sir okay you okay all right well let's go back to the council and uh frank banker you have the final word i think uh we should go deal with mr marriott all right i'm good with that um because this is a charter appointment we're going to have to take this in a roll call vote penny so if you don't mind please uh take roll council member banker yes council member notaro yes councilmember roberts yes councilmember shirley aye councilmember zable yes vice mayor gunn aye mayor gattis aye so it passes seven to zero and congratulations mr riegler and thank you for stepping up to the plate now we are on to item three which is compensation terms for the appointed interim city manager originally mr reeves proposed compensating mr riefler an additional two thousand dollars per month later council member roberts suggested increasing mr ripler's additional compensation to one thousand dollars per pay period it was also suggested that this additional compensation would be retroactive from the date of june the sixth when mr rievler was appointed as the acting city manager i believe everyone agreed to this that i'm going to need a motion to continue motion made by frank banker do i have a second second second by lloyd roberts mr banker do you have the floor um i believe this is well overdue by uh what 14 days now he's been doing the job for since d-day and uh he deserves the conversation my colleague mr roberts wants to do it one thousand dollars for the main period i'm fine with that too thank you mr banker other council members vice mayor gunn what's the difference in pay between the recommended by the current ex-city manager than reeves 2001 and your recommendation of thousands were very very yeah it's just a little bit more and i think from a payroll standpoint it makes it easier since they get paid every two weeks rather than go through the significant arithmetic divided so if you multiply 2 000 times 12 and then divide that by 26 you know that comes out to be the two week pay credit so what is the difference 2 twenty seven cents i'm not sure exactly i think it's two thousand even annual well it's two thousand times twelve if it's monthly and so that would be twenty four thousand but if you do it bi-weekly that's 26 it's a mute item because we've got to put a new city manager in a couple weeks anyway so right that's what i'm saying nice amazing theoretically yeah i think mr roberts is playing this pattern i mean it's quick it's easy mr mayor of one second mr roberts i just had a question about the retroactive i mean i'm for that is that is that not an issue it's not it's not an issue it is permissible given that he has been fulfilling the role to that date if you if you make it retroactive to him assuming the role and it's commensurate with the services he's provided it is not a windfall bonus or anything of the sort based on efforts extended in service of the city council members say yeah that was my question because it appeared at first bw i mean we already had a city manager in place and then we put that in for i believe the precise state and i would defer to administration as this is not my most specifically but my understanding of the way it functioned was that mr uh reefer assumed that job on the wednesday when mr reeves had begun his vacation so it wasn't to the monday of the meeting but the wednesday of june 8th immediately following that meeting so that would not be a double building it was the moment mr mr riefler ascended to the position back to manager he would be compensated in conduct yeah i just want to make sure that he has i mean we're watching our budget here and just want to make sure that we're not you know excessively grinding anybody or any future employee that type ultimately that is the decision just behind us as the appropriations yes sir so what was the agreed upon pay range i don't have that in front of me 95-100 was initially 90 to 150. i know the word i know there were two different i know vice mayor john submitted an email that had two numbers and then i had submitted two numbers as well they were very very close but i don't know if we ever made a final decision so i mean i remember lloyd i think it was 85 to 110 voids and i guess what mr gunn is asking is what does that make on a yearly basis what would that mean mr reaper is paying i think that's our employees essentially you've got a new city manager where does he fall in their perspective you need to take his current salary and do that a thousand dollars a week because that's effectively what we're doing what's the bottom line what do you think he should be making right do you brought him along what we're talking about right now is just for the interim status well this interim status is moving to 96 000 a year but he kept kept him in one with the thousand dollars which is currently making now twenty six thousand dollars okay [Music] okay what is he making now that 63 or 10 26. now we make 65 plus 30 six plus that's based on his auto compensation too we're not extending this out for a year this is just for the period well it's in mystic mr based on excerpt well he also he has an annual salary plus the monthly part of us well you can't include the monthly carbon to the salary okay let's get this conversation under control um are you finished okay thank you any other council members comments and then i'll come back no okay well you can't he can't i mean he uses his car for i mean this man used his truck for all over the city so i'm sure he's using his car or his truck whatever all over the city so he can't lock that into a salary i have no problem with someone making an amendment to this motion but as it stands right now the motion is for it's a thousand or a thousand dollars per pay period and why don't we stick with that when we find our new city manager we discuss the whole okay i had a question on the effective day for some reason i was under the assumption that the effective date was that day that day that we we uh voted to make him the acting uh city manager whether he was actually filling in or not otherwise it would be flipping the switch off and on it's the way that the approved motion of that meeting was structured was that mr riefler would be the acting city manager upon the unavailability or declared unavailability of mr reeves the absence of mr reese from the jurisdiction declared unavailability mr reeves on that monday had communicated that on wednesday he intended to travel outside of the region beginning his period of absentia and he would return for this meeting but um over the budget meeting not the special needs that was not contemplated at the time but the idea on the floor to avoid any confusion during the course of meeting on who would be sitting to buy immediate left as it were was that upon um manager reeves uh departure and declaring the availability thereafter which has been declared to be wednesday okay so during the time that mr reeves is now back and is the city manager on site is mr riddler actually eligible for this pay or is he ineligible you could prorate it that way you could make the determination that he is still providing it's within this it's within this body's determination ultimately how you're going to allocate these funds and this was part of why i had suggested that these matters be bifurcated between first appointing and two advocating and also why it was not handled that night there's been any question why did we do it that night i'd hoped in that time that we had been some reflection or thought on that but that is precisely and this is also why we were seeking why the separation agreement was contemplated is because you do have situations even if they're sparing or mr reeves is here he's the manager as in this moment so ultimately it's this body's determination how it wishes to allocate any wage increase if any to misery so i am open to the sixth which is was the monday where we or i'm sorry that was tuesday the following day uh was the day that mr uh reeves left town and so that would be the seventh i'm fine with the sixth or the center it's entirely up to this council if someone wants to amend the motion to make it seven i'm okay with that if not then i propose that we move forward just this one clarification in my own head so it was a thousand dollars every two weeks correct correct any other comments from the council before i go to these citizens hello citizens any comments nope back to the council with uh mr baker are you having the last word i believe i'm sorry so this is compensation for the appointment of the manager which we just appointed yes because we wanted to give him compensation on the beginning june the 6th but then we realized that there was a conflict where you couldn't have two city managers the following day mr reeves went out of town took a vacation and the only only alternative was to have an appointed acting city manager and and the council i believe the council agreed that there was no difference it was just that we had to have someone here uh standing guard so my point is in his job description [Music] his his job description says he is correct so he was just doing his job as community services and assistants yes so he's been compensated are we retroactive giving the thousand dollars per pay period effective june 7 percent right now the motion is beginning june the 6th or actually i guess that would be end of day june the 6th does that mean mr mark can you help us out the motion on the floor presently stands at june the 6th 1000 per pay period um and that that is the motion on the floor if a member of this body wishes to change that motion that may be done if the member who ultimately who initially moved wishes to withdraw their motion that is also an auction procedurally they can either a motion can be proposed to amended in which case the motion maker would have to accept the amendment as friendly if they don't the initial motion maker can withdraw or alternatively the motion would stand and fail a standard fail on its own i think uh to expedite this that the correct the correct way to do this would be to start nato june the 7th because we voted from june the 6th and he actually didn't do anything until the following day so i need someone to make a motion to amend if you agree with that mr mr mayor why nichola dying the guy out of the day's pay i mean this is like a seinfeld episode more work more responsibility not much more money i mean i think he deserves high compensation from june 6. this mayor yes sir i don't believe his name uh he didn't start i mean this whole situation were very driven by starbate's actual duties he was not until the following morning because we were you know meeting at night the actual start of the election most jobs that's for clarity for clarity in the record just because the way the discussion is going and my apologies for interrupting the council members and it's not my inclination to do that remember manager reeves left the jurisdiction on the 8th on the 7th manager reeves was here for the full day the 8th was the first full day in the event that is informing your decision making wednesday the 8th is the first full day during which mr reefer was in that position member baker made the motion uh for the thousand dollars per pay period beginning the monday member banker has i believe communicated no desire to withdraw the motion i believe was a member zabel who had seconded members abel had seconded it if the member's able withdraws his support the motion would need a second otherwise a proposed amendment can be considered and these are the those are the procedural approaches to if if the body desires to change its current course just just my apologies i'll retain my support no just for the record mr richard who's been attending workshops council meetings before his uh determination so he's been doing all the responsibilities he wasn't doing them a year ago on my own special needs he would then so again you're nickel and diming this guy okay he's taking on the responsibility as the mayor said i agree with you one thousand percent thank you for stepping up so what are you gonna do scorching for a day or two thank you mr banker i'd like to hear from other council members before we take this to the public mr roberts if i recall my memory is not always great i think we decided on the sixth only because that was a monday and it was the first day of pay period so my only question to you andy is is that a problem that we have an overlap of that hundred dollars per day even though the city manager is here i mean is that a problem we just say i i've not done the analysis on whether those 200 would present a tremendous legal issue for this community i will tell you that the word to become an issue the remuneration could be sought from the employee separately [Music] i'm trying to remember where the the other part of that was your recollection i want to clarify the record the motion that was approved ultimately was that assistant manager reflert would become the acting city manager effective upon mr reeves absence from the jurisdiction were declared unavailability which the understanding at the time was and the facts revealed themselves to be would begin on wednesday the 8th there was no change of the guard or authority until wednesday if that informs your decision so now we're the motion stands at june the 6th you're more than welcome to make a motion to amend to the 7th or the 8th or we can cancel this motion out and start over with a brand new motion and if i cancel it out there i would say that it would be too absent withdrawal or amendment it would need to be voted on standard failure either way we're taking another vote before we actually if it isn't the hand game correct i would move to amend the motion to make it effective june days remember natero is proposing an amendment to the standing motion the main motion on the floor was made by member banker number bankrupt are you amenable to the proposed amendment the motion maker is not amenable to the amendment being made mayor procedural leaders proceed on its own the emotion would perceive on its independent so there's no amendment no way to abandon this absent approval of the individual motion maker from a from a rules of procedure standpoint that is how that is ordinarily involves mr mayor interesting [Music] or is it just because because i don't think we've had a second on this motion i i think from my experience though it does have to be approved by the person who made the original emotion under robert's rules that's how it that's how it functions i'm trying to pull up your rules and procedures they were sent to me um candidly i did not anticipate needing to be fluent in this particular aspect of it it's quite all right historically that's what we've done in the past we had a motion made then we had a second then it went up for debate and if it was determined that someone on the council did not like the motion they could propose to amend it and make a motion to do that we would vote on that motion and if it was approved then now that became the motion to vote on so the word amend is used twice your code can as it relates to your rules procedure rules of debate said amendments to in section 2-62 rules of debate sub i a motion made by a member of the city council shall be germaine to the item before the city council for discussion and debate which has happened amendments to a main motion shall be voted upon in reverse order of being made only one main motion shall be moved and placed before the city council at any given time amendments to a name motion shall be voted upon in reverse order of being made there's no reference by these rules to the amendment being received as hostile or amenable by that end i would say that the motion would be voted on independently as you've done in the past okay thank you very much my apologies for the confusion no worries i understand other communities do it differently and we sort of loosely on robert's rules uh so we have a motion table right now made by council member nataro to amend this motion to a start date of june the 8th 2022 do i have a second second second by lloyd roberts uh council member nataro you have the floor i think we've talked about it that was the day that lyndon left town and kyle officially became thank you very much do we have any other council members that like it uh yes chris i have no problem with the pay structure what [Music] it seems it may be cleaner up until he just voted him in as a university manager he was active that's in his job description his current job straight so if you clean this up and say hey he was acting he was doing his job he just already come in his interrupt interview city manager start the clock so you're going to get some resistance and push back remaining i got no problem with the pay just i see he's doing his job acting city manager and that's how you clean it up you know he's in your manager start the clock okay so do we have a second right now we we do lloyd okay so now we need to uh is there anyone else that would like to make a comment on this before i go to the citizens well in his job description i don't have it in front of me but i'm sure at the bottom like most job description says and and all necessary functions required okay so you can tell him to sweep the floor too but he's been doing the job okay lynn's been taking a lot of vacation and he deserves it and i think he's just nickel and dime i don't think we're showing the respect he deserves why not thank you very much do we have any citizens that would like to comment on this nope all right back to the council with leslie nataro all right let's take a vote on amending the original motion to where the start date is june the 8th 2022 all in favor say aye hi okay now that we've got that oh sorry i was just so there's i i'm opposed you are opposed all right noting frank banker opposes all right now we move on to the original well now the amended motion and that is to let's get back here so if i say this correctly let's see here now we are council member robert suggested increasing mr riefler's additional compensation one thousand dollars per pay period and now it's retroactive from the date beginning june the 8th and if all is good with that we're back to the council again for comments and then we'll go to the citizens no citizens nope all right back to the council all right let's take a vote on this one and we are going to have to um we don't have to do a rule called vogue lesson so all in favor and say hi hi any opposed when done opposes all right so it passes six to one congratulations mr riepler now we are up to item four which is the proposed continuing contractual relationship with lynn race first off do i have a motion agreement on professional municipal executive services leslie torreira do i have a second second second by lloyd roberts this is the tarot you have before i i think we've we've talked about this before and i think it makes perfect sense to keep living on a contractual [Music] any other council members uh yeah yes my spare gun who has in this in other words who's the point of contact for consulting manager city manager spelled out in the terms of the agreement to give the necessary context on may 2nd 2022 the the town of the city agreed to an addendum to the employment contract that reads in full the city of bellar beach desires to continue the services of lindy reeves in a consulting capacity after the effective date of his resignation and completion of terminal leave a city manager during terminal leave the city will reimburse the cost of actual travel expenses the party's desire to compensate then de-reuse in the following manner 60 per hour plus the cost of any actual travel expenses that was all of it and so what this agreement seeks to do is delineate exactly those kinds of concerns the scope of services here contemplates mr reeves will facilitate the adoption of the city's budget facilitate transition of leadership to his successor the city manager provide insight on previous management decisions analysis and goals and provide such other insight advice and skills as may be required by any person occupying the office of acting interim or contracted city manager for the term of the agreement the agreement has a one year term payment is again at the 60 per hour but it specifically contemplates that on the first of each month or soon thereafter is practical reefs will submit to the city manager an invoice itemizing his time spent tax performed and any correlating charges or expenses for performance and cert see the agreement if that manager disputes the charge they will submit it in writing to mr to any of those charges submit them in writing to mr reeves to resolve just as you would if you said hey randy it says here you build for this and oh that's the wrong city by mistake i'll fix that entry um and so those sorts of things i did before at in the drafting process i conferred with mr reeves and asked him if he's amenable and aware of how that obligation would work he said he's prepared to do that and so that would not create an unnecessary or undue administrative burden everything after um the third third paragraph is the agreement term which is one year unless sooner terminated by either party thereafter can only be renewed by written agreement of the parties and everything after that is really what most people tend to call legalese boilerplate necessary contents that will protect both parties involved and also memorialize terms required by statute with contractors like public records so that's how this would have that's how the something else the interim the acting the whoever shall serve as highlander whoever is your city manager is the gatekeeper of this process and it is it is contemplated to be ea as they use the medical profession prn or on an as needed basis there's not a need for lin's insight um then then lynn will enjoy his the comfort of his family and his time but if if that insight is needed and available he'll provide it he is an independent contractor not an employee in this arrangement so that's how that would be and i believe it it's uh perfectly acceptable for this council to ask for a monthly report of the expenses generated by these police and whoever the city manager is like a reasonable contract to me and it leaves travel in there with reservations so he's not taking a limousine from there you know here and back and so i think this is a good agreement and and i believe it will also benefit from utilizing mr reeves knowledge extensive knowledge of this city and its history do we have any other council members that like us would like to make comments two parts is one are we protected from any future claims against the city in this contract there is not an indemnification provision if that's specifically what you're asking i did contemplate that provision given that mr reeves would be an independent contractor functionally in retirement i if this body wishes to negotiate that i thought that might be a likely being on starter giving the parties to spare positions you do have your whatever insurance coverage would ordinarily operate for any contractor just as myself or anything else um operating in service of the city um you're also afforded of course on protections as a software under your liability statutes but no this does not create any um added duty or a burden of liability upon mr reeves or insulation to the city i just want to make sure because the event of travel obviously things can't happen accidents therefore i just want to make sure that we're identified from that there is not an indemnity division in this uh the second one was is there a minimum charge for him to come out we have travel included you just can't bring somebody out of bed for a half hour piece of work usually in some contract service contracts there's a set minimum you know if we call him up there must be four hours charged for example is there anything in this contract such as that there is not a set minimum in this contract and that is in part to defer to the one discretion of your whomever is your manager in that regard and also in recognition of the modern working landscape i believe that travel would be the exception and not the rule mr ruiz would be available via phone or any other telecommunication platform and travel would be were it absolutely necessary or they were real i might and perhaps i'm presuming too much to say so but since we're dealing in taxpayer dollars that that would not be used for frivolities like hey i just wanted to check and see how things are doing and if this filing cabinet looks okay but more there is real value added to mr reeves physical presence okay so there's no additional charge in the city for and it sounds turbulent times but phones uh setting up telecommunications you know a network combined network contract just for the purposes of being a manager assistant sister because this wasn't i will tell you this was not just as the last agreement this was not the product of some extensive negotiation or workshopping process this was put to you as a proposal i was navigating the tension between over lawyering the document from what had been half paragraph to try and add those protections to try and capture the essence of that agreement so the way it reads now is the city further beyond the 60 per hour city further agrees to compensate briefs for any reasonable travel expenses directly related to or resulting from this agreement so the only remunerations are the 60 dollars an hour and travel there is no provision in here to reimburse a portion of his cell phone bill electricity in his home right or any other potential to minimize charge that is associated with this and if there is an effort to do that that would be a charge that would likely be submitted disputed and resolved in a manner that would be reasonable to the parties that that reasonable qualification did not exist or directly related to non-existent prior draft so there is something that i that i'm still questioning here uh and you brought this line actually this conversation has is how do we control billing so a five minute phone call is that an hour is that five minutes to be contributing towards an hour this is the one thing that i think is missing is because uh effectively kyle can call him three times in the day and if every phone call is an hour now we're into some big bucks uh so understanding that if you wish to amend this um my my understanding that that terminology doesn't exist in here to the extent i discussed it at all with member reeves or mr reeves i um i had explained it that it would be just akin to how i built right i built in minimum certain increments um so if you wish to say minimum 10 minutes 15 minute whatever interval we can amend the agreement accordingly um again this is a proposal for your body for this body to consider if you wish to make provision for a minimum increment that can be added to this agreement um as provided mr reeves doesn't object to the term the parties agree on that term then you're allowed to as parties define the terms of your agreement i would be okay with 15-minute agreements is that is that pretty standard for what you do [Music] the law tends to do six-minute increments it's because it evenly divides an hour and tenths and every six minutes is a point one so when you get an attorney who reads your email and takes them seven minutes it's a point two whether it's seven or eleven it's a point two i mean most your your prior attorney didn't build in those increments um uh mr uh once said frederick was last name but yeah mr reilly did not build those increments so i would say that it varies by party and by contractor across industries 15 minutes is not unreasonable it divides an hour evenly in four increments so what would the council like to do can we go ahead and approve this with stipulation that the increments are available by 15 minutes if you make a motion to that effect and it's approved by the body i would suggest you make sure that you see if mr reeves hasn't even put on the matter but yes you can remember reasons uh energy said he's fine a voice not quite as obnoxious is that emotional 15 minute increments correct that's a motion to amend that we need building 15 minute currents do i have a second second second by glenn gunn uh you've made your comments would you like to say anything else yes sir any other council members on the 15-minute amendment back to the citizens yes sir 22nd street the monthly report i'm listening to what all got to be done the monthly financial for the consulting let me interrupt you where right now we're debating on the adding the 15 minutes so whenever we get back to the main motion i'm sorry you're welcome to maintain anyone else all right back to the council all right let's take a voice vote on amending the contract to 15-minute increments all in favor right great so now we are back to the main motion with our the main amended motion for this contract with a 15-minute amendment onto the contract we have any more council comments before we take it to the citizens this is an entire agreement there's no work that's included in this he's told he sold a dependent contract correct the only that would be the only change to the agreement before you he is an independent contractor whether how an independent contractor could make that claim as a separate thing to say if he's hurt traveling i can't give you blanket statements based on how things operate in the wall let's take this to the citizens right quick miss transit did you have would you like to make a comment i need to ask a question john hansen 22nd street in this monthly financial report that's going to be required for these consultations and financials are you going to require receipts for authorized travel when needed to be here to do business i hadn't heard that in any of the conversation i just wanted to know it's a general requirement in terms of if you're going to provide remuneration it's the reasonable you're agreeing to compensate for any reasonable travel expenses directly regulated too there would have to be some some proof of that report itself members would also be a public record as with those receipts i would expect the same thank you very much mr anthony thank you anyone else in the uh citizens yes all right back to the council anyone have a comment they'd like to make oh if that's the case let's take it to the final vote to approve this contract all in favor any opposed okay so the contract passes and that being said um i think it's time to conclude this this uh this special counsel meeting because we have six minutes to prepare for the taxes do i have a motion to adjourn before before you go to adjourn i do have one piece of business i do we very very quickly want to address with you just because of how the law operates on a particular issue the city received correspondence about a month ago from a party disputing the city the validity of the city's ordinance requiring the registration for short-term rentals of condominium units we've i've reviewed it with mr riefler mr reeves and i've uh i have a draft response that will go out tomorrow it's been sent to each of you um it was sent about two hours before this meeting that was the timeline which was completed uh we i will i'm happy to discuss it with each of you individually but i needed to make it clear in a public meeting that that was pending and i will contact you each individually afterwards thank you very much yes sir sorry look at the sensitivity to the protocol of how this was done i think that the protocol is you have a work session discussion debate providing guidance to what you want and direction instead of something coming forth with a special meeting throw it down it's done here the numbers let's take a quick vote of this there's a there's a sensitivity to a perceived pressure okay let's just get this done it's one of those things that you need to make haste slowly on because it's a binding decision that hey we're responsible for the residents and doing the right thing i'm sensitive to it because of the last couple of years how things were done and things were done in the shadows or whatever and then all of a sudden something was thrown down in front of us and i didn't like it his body is here because business is done in the sun right here we discuss it we debate it and then we provide direction and guidance for how we're going to do this thing there was no backup material in the website for this stuff so we navigated some of our duties for getting this information out to the residents it's a slippery slope and i'm i'm concerned about it and just consider that in for future actions that's all i have thank you very much i was aware that there was an issue unfortunately the agenda went out a day early and then the supplemental information followed and that was sent by the city attorney and uh it was improper and i meant to bring something up about it but the agenda was accomplished [Music] and that's that was the mistake was uh we were under the wire to get a special meeting in on top of the existing meeting and timing being the essence we have a city manager who was in and out in and out and he's ready to go so i'm not going to buy the time is of the essence because this meeting goes back to several weeks we could have had a work session in between and just like other things we've done lately it's just thrown down in front of us i didn't i actually didn't feel that way because we had everything in front of us as far as the contracts we've had them long enough to read through them and decipher them and ask the city attorney questions and as far as the mr ripler being moved over and getting a pay increase we all knew it was coming so again i need to we need to adjourn this meeting and do i have a motion here i have a motion frank banker and who made a second i'll say basically to tara all in favor to end this meeting [Music]"
