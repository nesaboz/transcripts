up to the podium introduce yourself and uh and uh let's hear about your services thank you very much members of the council my name is randy mora i'm a partner at the tras danio law firm i'm joined this evening by my partner tom trask our real estate associate megan hamisevich and our other litigation associate municipal associate jeremy simon my partner jay daniel sends his regrets of not being able to attend it is his birthday and i think his cons other constituent base was very concerned with his presence at that home uh and also my partner eric agello had a family commitment some months ago that had been scheduled but um as i said my name is randy mora i'm a partner at the trastino law firm our firm specializes almost exclusively in the representation of local governments i've been with the firm for a little more than eight years now i'm a partner i'm board certified in city county and local government i've been the town attorney for the town of kenneth city since august of 2014 and the city attorney in indian rocks beach for roughly seven years just a little less than i've been in uh kenneth city you recently as you well know uh went to the market seeking attorney services and we responded and that brings us here this evening and i say it that way because i want to emphasize what it is you said you were looking for you said you were looking for an attorney who can provide you exceptional communication exceptional understanding of the council manager form of government in innovative and creative solutions with and the capacity to work with a variety of diverse groups while maintaining civility order and independent legal advice i'd submit to you i think i'm unequivocally the best candidate for that based on those qualifications i have a demonstrated uh pardon me i have a demonstrated record in history serving local governments in this community going further back than that i am as i joke a tremendous dork i met my wife doing ymca youth and government some 20 years ago almost this is my life's passion i feel very passionately about the service to local government and the protection and preservation of the public trust our system is founded on people like you making those sacrifices and i i want to begin by thanking you for the time you spend here even if i'm not selected it's important to know that this is a critical part of the process of our governance um i believe in this so passionately that in addition to serving as the town attorney in kenneth city and also an indian rock speech i also traveled the state working with the florida league of cities and florida municipal insurance trust to educate elected officials across the state i was in south florida last week speaking on ransomware and local government technological and innovative issues i've been working with the institute of elected municipal officials i regularly speak on sunshine law public records ethics and their intersection with technology i've also been i've traveled as far as daytona to provide education on parliamentary procedure and how a body can become a more cohesive and effective body in doing its business and based on that have been asked by other communities to do the same in addition to those educational services my partners and i are also panel counsel with the florida municipal insurance trust the florida league of cities insurance agency and through that we've had the pleasure of representing this community and some of its officials uh historically we represent communities as far south as bonita springs in that and as far now north as yankee town towards the panhandle or at least that pivot and so through that i've gained a comprehensive understanding of the needs of local governments across the state not just in this community but most especially in pinellas county with that travel experience and variety of experiences i've also come to understand what the emerging issues are to assist local governments in getting ahead of problems and being proactive in their solutions and not purely reactive i do not consider myself a in your community eighth commissioner i have no interest in being a policy maker i have an interest in helping you shape policy helping you to make effective policy offering you guidance on what may be lawful what is prudent and ultimately allowing you to make that decision right or wrong i am a husband and a parent i give advice all the time that's ignored uh that's part of the job but we make sure you have the advice that you go in with informed knowledge through your process and that's really where i think i am the best fit based on that flexibility i've dealt with issues of first impression in the law and local municipal government even in my first 10 years of a career that i i know peers who've been doing this 30 and 40 years and have never confronted and i think i've handled those situations with poise trying to understand the interests of the shareholders the council members or commissioners at the time and recognizing while their interests may not align there may be a path forward to find that compromise that works for a community in addition to that i am not the only attorney you would be hiring if you hired me you would be hiring our firm we believe in a firm oriented practice it's why i'm joined by my colleagues this evening you get the depth of that bench if you will we have collectively just among the partnership i think we're now over nearly 70 years of collective experience over the partnership uh that is each with our own specializations my partner tom trast has extensive experience in code enforcement liens collections and things of that nature my colleague jay daniel has a tremendous experience in 1983 cases and and the litigate in the and the litigation needs of a community especially appellate needs my colleague erica argello has extensive experience especially for an attorney on issues of the florida building code and the like i as i've said i've established some of what my specializations are and that's not to say those are the only things we know about those are just some of the issues that were we have depth and we also have a real estate practice and we keep that within our practice not because it necessarily serves public uh public entities on a day-to-day basis but there will come needs where we will have to vacate an easement look at a right-of-way and it's helpful to have that kind of depth in your bench and those kinds of resources and bring them to bear for the communities we represent i love the sound of my own voice i could keep going i'm an attorney but i would rather make sure that you get the information from me that you came here for you have my resume and and my and my statements and how we and our ethos on how we intend to deliver services and so if you have questions about that i'd rather spend the balance of my time addressing your inquiries thank you very much um the way that i'm going to handle this is i'm going to call on each one of you and so what i'm going to do is start with frank banker move this direction and as soon as it gets to me then we'll go down to mike's able and come back this way uh then the vice mayor and then myself and we'll just keep repeating that cycle until we're completely exhausted you okay with that i'm committed to it let's do it all right uh mr banker do you uh have any questions um just one uh you're proposing a three thousand dollar retainer fee um and looking at that what it covers what doesn't it cover i guess um it's an excellent question the question uh for the benefit of everybody was we're proposing a three thousand dollar retainer so what is not covered by that retainer that retainer is considerably comprehensive and it's intended to be we've we've we represent presently a dozen communities between manatee and pinellas county and we've i think fine-tuned that process the the retainers intended to capture everything except functionally litigation services uh it's though though the topics are enumerated in in the response it's really where things get to be either a special project let's say we're going to be doing we're doing something unorthodox or we're going to be we're going to we are going to craft the first short-term rental ordinance that does x in the state and we're going to be going into new issues of the law that's going to require extensive research i may come to you or your manager at the time and say help me or not help me but i believe this is going to require special attention and usually when i do that i'm talking about something that's going to take about 15 hours or more um outside of the retainer and then at that point i say hey we've got a special project on our hands other than special projects it's litigation uh code enforcement we consider to be litigation uh if we if we prosecute those for you i know you're represented by pcso and pcso handles that but when it gets to the whether you use a magistrate or a courthouse and you need somebody there to preserve either the process or actually prosecute it we do that outside of the retainer because that's hard to to control as a it's going to always be this way but generally speaking virtually every serve all of my attendants at your meetings unless again we're doing special meetings and i'll give you an example i have a retainer in the town of kenneth city last year their manager clerk and two people in town hall all resigned within about a month of each other and i was the last person standing if you will the last charter official there and i facilitated that transition while being an advisor and never occupying that role but i told them this transition this is special this is different from business as usual and i will make the distinction between i'm just interpreting your ordinances or writing a new ordinance that's still retainer even if we're in this weird transition now if i'm doing this other thing that's outside the retainer it was a special project so it'd really be those like litigation and special projects and things out of the ordinary i want to also touch on the fact and i meant to state this i i know that you're in transition as your esteemed manager who i've had the opportunity of working with in the past is retiring because of that circumstance i'm very familiar with with the process of helping a council and a manager navigate a transition and i'm also prepared to facilitate in as much as the role of the attorney is relevant to that process thank you leslie matoro i have no questions thank you lloyd roberts yes randy so currently um one of your um occupations are the the assistant town attorney for the town of bel air so what is the role of the assistant town tourney is that was uh uh we we recently became our firm recently became legal counsel in bel air as recently as december of 2021 uh the way they were the way we structured that was with a principal attorney my colleague jay daniel is their city attorney i'm the assistant city attorney uh the way we've crafted that has been very specific to that community it's partly it's if jay is unavailable i'm there they they have a second person they can call i've covered meetings where there's been conflicts or conflicts in terms of scheduling not legal issues um or said differently you know hey we have we have two special projects going on let's divide the labor to make sure the client's needs are met in a timely fashion rather than say jay can only take them one thing at a time we're deploying two attorneys on that issue both of whom are recognized and familiar with the council or commission so that they're best poised to work with us and and and we're familiar faces for them so it's really there's nothing special to it except to say that i'm not the designated charter official they go to first i'm the backup and just a quick follow-up to that then so for the town of kenneth city and indian rock speech when do they meet do they meet monthly and you meet with them once a month and what day of the month uh yes it's my understanding your meetings are presently on mondays uh this city of indian rock speech meets on tuesdays it's ordinarily the second tuesday of the month they meet once a month uh they do also have subordinate boards that i or some of my colleagues like jeremy attend uh for them but those do not those don't meet on mondays uh town of kenneth city ordinarily meets on the uh second wednesday of the month occasionally on the fourth wednesday for a workshop or something of the sort i'll tell you that their manager recently provided notice and they're meeting a little more frequently than they might ordinarily do but that is that's the meeting schedule perfect thank you mike zable yeah if you uh drove to the meeting tonight passing over causeway you looked at a large expanse of water probably a few sailboats out here um can you walk me through the process that you would follow in basically evicting these type of boats that have been ward for months i appreciate the question i'll tell you that's a nuanced area of the law it is there have been some more recent changes on what authority cities have to go through that process i don't feel comfortable giving you the step-by-step legal process just because i haven't had occasion to revisit that in the last four years as an actual process we had that inquiry come up in indian rock speech and i did research it for them but the boat happened to be x amount of feet beyond their coastal boundary such that you know that the person knew where they were mooring but that is i will tell you that as a problem that is up and down coastal florida that is an issue in our coastal communities but we have navigated that in our office more recently in some of our other communities working with pcso because part of it is what is the community willing to do but then also what is your enforcement body willing to do and and do our legal positions on those issues align i would tell you that my first step would be to collaborate with your manager and pcso to say what has been done historically what what enforcement mechanisms have succeeded failed and reviewing the current state of the law to determine if we can as your rfp materials say find a newer innovative solution with a fresh perspective or if we just need to continue a process that may have been abandoned or sidelined because of other priorities at the time jody shirley [Music] so most of my questions have been answered but i do have one specific to your firm is representing um bellar beach and several council members and citizens through the league of cities on an active lawsuit does that um cause any conflicts in my estimation no it does not uh that is not unprecedented we represent other communities like the city of tarpon springs where their officials or their or the city itself has been sued and we principally serve as their city attorney in the litigation council that is a separate arrangement through the insurance through the insurance trust and those would be separate and distinct and where where it presents an issue we would determine that we we have where there is conflict we get conflict counsel we are not shy about that uh but that is our determination to make and then advise you on but as far as the current engagement i don't i'm not inclined to comment on the substantive elements of the of the active litigation i'll let the documents in the court record speak for themselves but i would just say that i don't foresee that being any impediment to our ability to provide you legal services in a prompt and responsible manner okay that was it for me glenn gunn hi randy good to see you and thank you for your time i actually have three questions for you the first one is have you read through the existing city attorney contract with with mr salzman or mr riley's previous contract the previous contract i have not reviewed mr riley's contract or mr salzman's contract we would propose we have one that we tend to use and i would i would stand on the merits of our agreement with you and if there's things aft if we are selected and you wish to negotiate with us and you find there's elements in your current attorney's contract that you would like to see in ours and we can we can resolve that then we will i know that um because our firm did apply back in i believe it was 2019 when you last went out to bid i do know that mr riley had a habit or a billing practice of billing in a particular increment different than the general industry standard of six minutes we do the 0.1.2 in six minute increments to divide an hour so that's one thing that i know is distinct from how mr riley approached billing but other than that i can't independently comment on his contract or or the town's previous contracts if there's something you wish for me to address i'm happy to do so okay so uh you know i'm familiar with your work with the iemo and florida league cities and come to know your expertise a little bit one of the things that we've tried to change in our recent contracts is to try to engender more of a consensus direction to the city attorney in other words direction to the city attorney comes from only one of two places either the city manager or the councilor itself and so while i understand that while individuals may call you for information or clarification on on legal issues my my question is is do you understand that when it comes to taking direction for assisting us with legal work or resolutions or ordinances drafts that sort of thing that you take that direction from the city manager or council do you have any concerns or see any conflicts there i have no concerns i would say if that's a concern of yours that it's better addressed in your code as a or your rules of procedure as opposed to a contract but i would tell you that to me that's not a novel concept and your council manager form of government under our florida bar ethical rules and otherwise our client is a body it's a collective i work for the seven of you and there may be three of you that want something done and four of you who do not and that may inform what work product ends up happening and that happens all the time but i work for all of you if one of you comes to me with an idea and says randy i would really like to explore i'll pick something off the wall we want to take our logo and make it an nft for digital sale in the you know bitcoin metaverse or something like that you know please move forward and then you say all those words and they sound like mumbo jumbo to your peers and they say why are we wasting time on this i'm not going to keep going just because one of you is very passionate that this presents an economic opportunity for your organization with you know new legal innovative solutions i work for the body and and i will tell you that at times that's created tension not tension but you know an issue between me and my clients and explaining to them i i'm not against your proposed solution just get your peers to tell me that that's what they want and i'll do it and so that's that is how that relationship should ordinarily work is is with all of you as as the client and trying to harmonize that where possible okay thank you for that explanation an item lasts and and this really uh defers to your experience with the florida league of cities and the iemo is explain to me a little bit in your background and experience what distinguishes an elected official from a citizen are there certain things that an elected official has to keep in mind in dealings with the public or how he relates to the public answers questions or that sort of thing vice just as a resident stepping up to the podium it was my understanding i only had 20 minutes your question thank you i think i have three hours now so i appreciate that um no i jokes aside there are some very real distinctions the moment you become i i joke in my presentations that the high point the best day of your public service is the moment that those election results are read and finalized and you won it's kind of downhill from there i joke because you're here in service of the warm fuzzy feeling of of trying to help the people around you and achieve the goals of making your community better but in doing that you're going to face criticism you're going to face ridicule that's part of the job and that's a difference i was having this conversation with the family member there are things i have to tolerate sitting at the dais that i would not tolerate from a private individual in my life i would cut that person out you know so that that's part of it um the other thing is what separates them is the voters the voters separate them your constituents picked you you know in the case of the most recent election each of you by nearly a quarter of the of the populace of the populists that voted at least picked you you have a backing you have a in some cases a mandate or a directive from your constituency base that you're acting upon individual residents don't have that same level of accountability they get to be an individual resident the day after and before an election and it and it doesn't change that can change for you that's that's a very real tangible difference the other tangible difference is amount are are abounding you become an agency under the public records law you have public records duty that private officials don't you have sunshine law obligations you have ethical restrictions criminal restrictions all of these things that extend you it fundamentally changes your life to become a public official it's why anytime i speak before you i thank you because you you agree to fundamentally change things about your life overnight in service of the greater good it's sort of a an absurd notion to some and so i think yes there are very real very tangible differences both in the law and as a matter of practicality that change that and then separately i work for you there will be times where your residents come to me as the city attorney and say hey i have a question now if i'm sitting here at the days they say i have a question about tonight i heard this this this is that what they're going to do last night at the meeting somebody said is there going to be public comment we're in a workshop and i explained to them the difference between a workshop and a meeting and they don't have to legally do it that doesn't mean as a matter of policy the presiding officer won't do it i explain all that but if a resident contacts me and says randy i'd like us to research how to get unmore boats out that's not my client i don't take that direction that's another difference i mean they are in my estimation somewhat countless but there are very tangible and real differences between the role of the resident and what you you are still residents of this community you don't cease to be residents but you have elevated duties responsibilities liabilities by being by by taking this mansion so so the follow-up to that question is is it is there an appropriateness to or or difference between as an elected officials giving an opinion as a elected official vice saying i'm taking off my elected official head and i'm putting on my citizens head and i'm going to speak as a citizen now from the dais is there i'm not sure i fully understand the contours of the question i will tell you that the law recognizes immunities for what is said from the deus so that there is not a chilling effect in our democratic process so that you recognize from up here i can say a lot more than i might even be will it be able to say the moment i leave this room even though i'm wearing the same hat but those distinctions will have to be made the wonderful lawyer answer to your question is it depends i would have to take those circumstances as they come because if you say oh i'm taking off my my officials have but it's my opinion that all the elected officials should be given free things everywhere they go and i'm i'm i'm gonna be the agent of change in this community you know that's not great no you can't do that uh but i i i don't you are not stripped of your ability to opine on the events in your community and you can choose to say whether it's on the record or off the record or as it's as a as the vice mayor or as a resident but you also have to recognize the public is going to choose to perceive it and and process it and characterize its own way and you can't always control that well put thank you all right um currently we have an uh a policy or a uh an ordinance for signs that is not being enforced in this community um it has been found that it is unconstitutional uh could you briefly give me an overview of how what what you would do to correct that problem and give us a an enforceable sign ordinance that um that would not it wouldn't be worth the time to challenge it absolutely and in as much as i can i want to assure you that this is not a problem unique to your community you guys are clearly in really great shape i mean fmit was here two weeks ago or in two meetings ago commending you for being a leader in establishing best practices in risk management you are commended for your financial practices you guys are moving in a very positive direction the fact that there are unresolved issues that there will always be more the where that comes from is around 2015 the supreme court decided a case called reed v gilbert out of the st out of the state of arizona where they functionally upended municipal regulation of signs by saying non-commercial speech has to be regulated especially for temporary signage has to be regulated in what they characterize as a content neutral manner which is what we all know you can't say it's a yay for this position no for that position but the practical effect of that is all temporary signage whether it is come to the boy scouts meeting coming for the cure 5k vote dave gaddis mayor have to be treated the same or come to this real estate open house and trying to reconcile those despair where we have ordinarily said well real estate signs are regulated this way and political signs are regulated this way and temporary events are regulated this other way there we have to now find a uniform system for regulating all of those and that is the challenge that that you're facing are we have personnel in our city who have drafted codes in fact one of my colleagues who couldn't join us tonight robert eschenfelder drafted a sign code for the city of lake hamilton we are not engaged there otherwise he was specifically retained because we have drafted sign codes specifically he has drafted sign codes for other cities like the city of dunedin and oldsmar and other cities and so we would bring to bear that resource that template bring it to you say here's what we ordinarily do let's make sure it fits the needs of your community go through the appropriate channels likely your land planning agency or planning and zoning board then an ordinance that you would see on first and second reading and that's how we would go through that but you know the first steps of that and i'm presently doing that in indian rock speech right now uh for for various reasons in a lot of communities it was harder to move forward and then just as many communities got traction and an understanding of how that jurisprudence had changed things then you know life happened in 2020 and it sort of derailed people's legislative priorities but be that as it may we're prepared to address that issue and it's and i would just wish to you know offer you some comfort that a lot of communities are still playing catch-up there was a decision issued just in the last two months by the supreme court on that line of jurisprudence and what's permissible in terms of temporary signage and what you can and can't do and so we continue to monitor that on a real-time basis thank you back to frank banker um real quick question how many pages is the sign orange that you drafted in the other city it varies city to city but i will tell you because you're talking about changing your code in response to a supreme court decision they tend to be lengthy in the first anywhere from five to ten pages with whereas clauses and findings that's not ordinarily how we draft things but we recognize that that area of the law is susceptible to legal challenge and we try to provide you all of the material you need to establish that you considered that you were aware of and that you harmonized into making that and making that adoption you tried to harmonize it with all those legal pronouncements so the ordinance can be and again it's community by community some strip out a lot of stuff but they're anywhere from i want to say 20 to 40 pages but that that that can be stripped down with with an understanding of the risks you take in trying to just make it quick and easy because because our ordinance right now i think is about six pages and it went from and fred riley did an excellent job i'm not putting any fault to them but it grew to about 26 pages and i don't think most of any of our council could stomach that big of an ordinance we we work at your pleasure but we will give you advice on what is legally what what attorney riley did is commensurate with what has been done in community across community in the state of florida for a while after that opinion there were only two law firms in the state who were drafting templates most wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because of the risks and out of that has grown the templates plural that other communities have used but very rarely based on how nuanced that case law is and all the things that you're trying to address and now we have the added specter of recent case law like senate bill 620 that may create potential claims uh for businesses if they feel that they've suffered business damages by virtue of a uh legislative change that you're trying to harmonize all of those and mitigate all those interests and it's very hard to reconcile those disparate interests and do so in five to seven pages thank you leslie natorio no questions all right lloyd roberts no further questions mike sable uh yeah specifically um have you and a firm dealt with uh negotiation mediation fact funding or arbitration and specifically have you ever done this between uh neighboring municipalities short answer yes there were a few things in there we regularly deal with mediation mediation is almost an immediate element of litigation no matter who the parties involved are whether they be private litigants we are presently representing a community in a county south of here who is going through it what we would call an intergovernmental dispute and navigating that there's a very specific statutory process and a series of meetings you have to have with specific attendees when you're mediating to avoid litigation with another governmental entity whether that be a community development district a municipality or the like so yes we have experience on it i've personally researched researched it my colleague jay daniel is handling that particular suit that i've referenced and they went through all those steps and still unfortunately based on the party's positions it involved garbage trucks on roadways and who's responsible for what repairs and damages but that is ongoing litigation but yes we are familiar with that jody shirley i have no more questions glenn gunn one last question how do you factor in risk management into your recommendations or advice to the city council in other words if we're dealing with an issue and there is a 20 chance that this will end up in litigation do you factor that in in your recommendation advice if maybe you know this is my expert opinion there's a 20 chance and because it's so remote i would recommend that you move forward with it understanding that there is a risk there but or do you just say nope there's a chance of litigation i recommend we not deal with it i've never once advised a client that the simple prospect of litigation is the reason enough unless they are just actively doing something that is clearly unlawful you know we're going to make sure that nobody can ever speak at a meeting again okay you can't do that i'm not going to go down that route but the prospect of you know i i tell i tell my public officials all the time there's three core rules to doing what you do one don't mess up two you're human you're gonna mess up don't hide it or avoid it and three critical to your question just because someone says you messed up doesn't mean you did the reality is that somebody can sue for any reason and that doesn't necessarily make that suit meritorious i will tell you how likely i think that is based on our knowledge of the litigation landscape and i've done that in for example indian rock speeches we worked through their short-term rental ordinance i advise them hey there were a few council members that said i would like to see a restriction that looks like x i said well that's we can do that there's nothing that says we clearly can't i will tell you we've represented another community that has faced 25 million dollars in litigation claims based on that restriction and we're actively litigating it i don't know how the court will resolve it and i don't know that may get appealed and i don't know what an appellate court will do if you have the insurance coverage stomach for litigation you can take that risk but you need to know it exists i try to shy away from i know it people want objective numbers is it 20 40 i try to shy away from that because it that's just so hard to gauge uh to to really tell you what the what the what the viability of litigation is and sometimes that can vary by communities communities with for lack of a better term more resources or residents that have more resources and more time tend to be more litigious uh because those residents can afford to engage in that process and so it's hard to definitively predict when you'll face that but yes i try to make sure you're aware my goal is not to make a decision my goal is to give you the information you need to make an informed decision and to make sure that a year later two years later you don't say well randy never told me had i known i wouldn't have you may disavow having been told that's a whole different thing but i will make sure it is my goal i'm human and myself capable of error but it is always my goal to make sure that you have as much information as practical to make an informed decision from the legal side there may be administrative concerns and i'll turn to your manager whomever is in that seat going forward and work with them in my ethos i will tell you from a from a work product standpoint when we're talking about new policy i consider your manager clerk and attorney sort of like your team avengers they are going to need to swoop in and work together to get you something because each of us deals with a different facet of how that's going to work out for you and we need to make sure that's harmonized i do no good if i help you draft a policy that your manager is either unwilling or incapable of enforcing and so we try to harmonize those things early in the process rather than just creating problems saying that's future randy's problem i'll let him deal with it thank you okay i have no other questions at this time does anyone else have other questions i do you do mike sable okay um briefly uh what would your first steps be upon assuming responsibility in this position and what would you hope to accomplish in this first year and this is my last question it's your mic you can have as many as you wish uh as far as what my first steps would be one making sure we have a contract that it memorializes our term lawyer thing two from a practical standpoint working with your existing interim attorney and mr salzman and i are very familiar i joke sometimes that i'm doing his career a few years later because he's been in kennedy and indian rock speech too um but we we have a very collegial relationship i would work with him to say what are the action items that are what is the work in progress what are the things that are midterm or for near term that you've been that have been identified for you and start establishing the workflow for that our firm is fully cloud-based in terms of our operations and i am a millennial so i tend to operate digitally which allows me to in at some times expedite that transition if those files exist that way because i can access them anywhere and and start indexing them and and creating a workflow based on that uh in addition to that part of the transition i would meet with your manager ask not only what do they need from the law legal transition but get an understanding of where the community is going in your manager transition process that's going to be a critical part of going forward and making sure if there's an expectation or potential need for legal advice through that process or just an independent guide i i've served that capacity very diligently i feel um and i'm very familiar with that so those would be my my two biggest things given that where you are presently understanding the workflow and then ultimately meeting with each of you individually if you're open to it and have the availability both so we can establish a rapport and so can i i can get a better understanding i mean i didn't come here sight unseen i know what some of you your platforms were whether it was you know public safety environmental control but i want to get an understanding of what is it that you wish to accomplish in your tenure and see if there's a way to to make that a possibility with you and among your peers uh that's that's a really key part of this right you're you came here with goals you're here in service of something or someone and it's i do you no service if i don't know what that something or someone is so i that would be another part of my process i'm coming in thank you very much anyone else all right to answer the question that hasn't been asked i am ready a as soon as possible for you i'm not forecasting a 45-90 day transition as soon as this community is ready to proceed i am ready to proceed thank you very much i think that's all we have for now now do we have uh thank you very much thank you thank you uh someone uh mr salzman is he here so hello mr salzman mayor you are with eunice salzman jensen pa and uh you're you are here to give us a presentation on your firm and what you have to offer belair beach so you have roughly 20 minutes and then we will ask questions thank you mayor mayor i want to thank you and the council for the opportunity to assist the city for the last couple months i've enjoyed and it's been a pleasure working with lynn and patty and the council on moving forward i think that the council has at least seen from the time that we've been working together of some of the things that i'm capable of doing i have provided a seminar for you all on sunshine law ethics and public records i have drafted some contracts and reviewed some i've dealt with the employment issues that unfortunately we're dealing with lynn leaving i'm familiar with dealing with all those issues i have been practicing for 36 years in pinellas county and so i would tell you that of that time i started as a prosecutor as did one of my partners tr eunice since that time i have worked in local government for approximately 30 years i currently represent the city of gulfport a city attorney four independent fire districts as their general counsel and a dependent district uh that is dealing with recreation and library for pinellas county my firm is uh involved in a lot of insurance defense litigation including that of involving governments um i have worked with tom trask over the years on numerous occasions currently working with him now uh so it's somewhat uh symbiotic relationship since you do uh general counsel work and you end up representing some of the insurance defense you work together uh and and i enjoy working with tom and have all the respect in the world for his firm i believe that i can continue and help the city with what we have started i think you have some changes that are coming um before you and i think the main issues at least the way i see them are the employment matters involving the replacement of lynn changes in the zoning which you have started to deal with and we're dealing with some additional aspects of that and also i think code enforcement is a paramount issue that we're dealing with i have handled all aspects of code enforcement i've advised the clearwater code enforcement board as their attorney for over 25 years i prosecuted cases for code enforcement in front of magistrates and in front of the courts i recently had one for a couple hours in pinellas county in which we were successful so all those areas of the law i'm familiar with there's probably no area that you're going to deal with that i haven't dealt with i've drafted ordinances i've drafted crafted referendums i've drafted contracts i mean there's no different than really um the trask firm we all deal with the same issues we all end up dealing with it the one thing i would tell you is probably a little different between me and them is that you'll be dealing with me um there's rare occasions when i will not be here if there's a conflict that i'm on vacation that's about it i attend all your meetings uh i handle all the matters with the city manager my firm is available to do additional work but almost all the time you'll be dealing directly with me i have the experience doing it and i believe that i can give the advice necessary to uh continue on and and help the city of bel air beach and appear mayor they answer any questions i would tell you one thing on my proposal uh i tend to charge people hourly if the city wants to have a retainer agreement i'm happy to do that normally what i do is i uh use whatever hours that i'm representing you under the retainer so it's whatever we work out uh as you could tell my hourly rate was 175 an hour on the retainer that i proposed it would have come out to about 160 an hour um as a discount but i also like to remind council there are times when you may not need me that many hours during a given month so it's up to council whether or not you want to do that there are months during the summer where you may not be meeting as often or there might be issues that are going on and i don't think it's necessary for you to pay me for time i'm not here um so for the most part hourly works out but whatever council wants to do is fine with me mayor i'm here to answer any questions all right oh so we're going to start from the opposite end this time with mike sable okay same question is have you dealt with the negotiation mediation fact-finding or arbitration between neighboring communities i'm doing one right now for a community development district in pasco county been handling it for a while it's dealing with some issues between actually driving and access between one community development and the other so i'm i'm handling that right now i have no questions jody shirley no no uh glenn gunn not at this time not at this time all right frank banker um you were saying about building us by the hour rather than a retainer you've been with us a couple months now how many hours do you feel you've been putting in per month do you oh wait i should know this because we get the bills but we haven't been putting in a lot of time i think um what we've tried to do is is make sure some of the things that fred had done what we could move through as you're well aware um we're dealing a few things with the zoning ordinance that we just passed uh dealing with some things with lynn and uh and making sure that we had an agreement going forward um for him uh but for the most part i i think we've i thought that maybe we've kind of been waiting until we get this position set and how council wants to move forward of course with a new council i mean you're we had a pretty uh good workshop in which you all went through a lot of the things and things that we're following up on so um i think council will determine how much time is spent thank you toro i have no questions no questions uh lloyd roberts i know i know you have been working with us for a couple of months so and you've been to our council meetings and also our workshops do you think there would be any workload challenges based on the cities and or fire departments you're working with now if you took on this opportunity full time no i do not believe so okay okay and i'm going to ask the same question about our sign ordinance what would be the pathway to correcting the problems we have right now well based on and and frankly i'll be honest mayor i could hear some of the comments out there um i think that we would have to do an extensive look at your sign ordinance um and make the changes that i that randy mentioned to make sure that they're legally permissible i have drafted amendments to sign ordinances and i've defended sign ordinances so i'm pretty familiar with the aspects of it but we would sit down and workshop uh we would probably have a proposal for you to look at and then we would go through some of the questions that council would have uh there are as uh as pointed out there are some nuances that we have to look at um and and ironically it's a tiny bit similar to what i was mentioning monday night um what recently came down with the supreme court on the flag uh laws so we have to be very careful on free speech and we have to make sure that things are content neutral that's the first part about it and the rest of it is then determined uh based on size and those issues but uh it's something that we can put together i'm i'm not going to tell you how to do it in in one or two meetings because we want to make sure it's done correctly in your opinion would it be more economically sound and safer to outsource that particular job i i don't think so okay i don't think it's necessary all right thank you very much uh back to mike zable okay um we'd be assuming this is gonna be a fresh start because you're filling in for an existing attorney but what would your first steps be upon assuming responsibility in the position and what do you hope to accomplish in the first year well the first steps obviously are dealing with the getting a new city manager making sure that process runs smoothly for council making sure we have an employment agreement in place the council is happy with so we can move through that transition relatively quickly uh the second part at least from what i've talked to you all about is we we really have to get a hold of some of the code enforcement that you want handled there are many different avenues of handling code enforcement obviously you have the sheriff that can come out and handle some of it some that we can take to a civil court if you so decide some that we can pursue uh in a quasi-what we call quasi-criminal matter is that by taking the citations or bringing forth some type of action that would take us into the criminal courts complex um so that's really going to turn on how council feels about that i think additionally as mayor pointed out that we have the sign issue and that sounds like one that we need to just jump on currently what we've been doing is somewhat maintaining status quo during this time period as i said to make sure that we took care of some of the things that fred had uh out there and and uh at this point it would be as you said starting new and seeing what council wanted us to move forward my job is to take care of what you need you're the legislative body and i'm part of the team that moves it forward i strongly believe in the team approach i strongly believe in working with patty and lynn and lynn's replacement on bringing things forward to uh council so that you can deal with it accordingly so that that's an approach that i would meet with them what i do currently in gulfport is before the thursday before our council meetings i i come to the city and we sit down and we go through everything so that we make sure that you have everything that you need for your council meetings and upcoming upcoming council meetings to make sure that uh we've looked at everything and if there's something in addition that i need to do that i'm prepared at your meeting jody shirley i have no questions uh glenn gunn the city manager very astutely crunched some of these numbers with respect to the billable hours in the last couple of months so during the interim period we went back and looked at the building and basically it averages about 17 hours a month and when we went back and looked at fred riley's billing towards the tail in there when we got over some of the issues with direct who was directing it and uh unilateral uh direction for resolutions and ordinances and that sort of thing it was 17 hours or less so the only difference is the way i see it is the difference in the retainer fees that's that's the difference right now is what i see and uh so i guess the question is is what do we get for the difference in that retainer because there is a difference in the retainer fees you know vice mayor and i think i mentioned it i'm not a big fan of the retainer and i just put it down there in case you needed it or some cities like it and some cities like to budget accordingly if you want to move it down i'm fine with that i'm fine not having one i do i do not want to be in a position where you're looking at it and saying well you know we only andy only builds 12 hours this month and we're paying him a retainer because then in essence i'm i'm taking your money i don't want to do that uh i would include um any litigation that i'm doing on there but again i i prefer to just do it hourly because you're controlling the situation and uh you know one month if we're spending a lot of time doing something you may determine that the next month you don't want to it's how you set your budget i mean of course obviously i'll be part of attending those meetings when you set your budget and i'm cognizant of what it is for the city attorney but i don't need a retainer i'm happy to bill howardly frank banker um that said uh your fee is 175 per hour yes how long will you lock that fee in for us well i'm i'm laughing because i actually have a couple clients that have said to me you really need to raise your rates you haven't raised them in about a decade after you lock it in um so right so um one of the things i did recently is put in a cost of living increase on an annual basis which is probably somewhat fair to do but frankly if you want me to lock it in for a period of time i'm happy to do that thank you i'm going to make a comment on that i think this council is has decided that we would periodically review all contracts and that would be the time where we would where we would uh investigate a a rate change okay leslie notoro no questions lloyd roberts yes what are some of the arguments that the city that asked to have a retainer what is the benefit i think i think it's budgetary plus some cities feel like they can they don't want to call you because we're charging you hourly versus oh it's in the retainer it's fine to have them contact them over anything frankly i would tell you i'd rather you call me or have the city manager call me and deal with an issue that we could discuss on the phone before it becomes a big issue for the city i have never really had a problem honestly in all the years i've been doing this where anybody's accused me of or if they thought we've you know overbilled them or spent too much time doing something so so that's kind of why i look at it as it's really a non-issue i think the 17 hours is probably an average that we'd be looking at if we get involved in some type of um action code action something along those lines that particular month might be more but again the city's in control of that right so if we if we had a four thousand dollar retainer with your firm and we only used 15 hours that particular month we're still out the four thousand dollars that's the way retainer works now if you wanted to go with the 3 000 uh dollar retainer and we reduced the hours we could do that okay and if we go over those hours then it's billable at 175 exactly so that's why i look at it i mean the only discount was it went to 160 an hour right under under those terms so if we want to do a retainer for a certain amount of hours at 160 an hour i'm happy to do that um okay so it's whatever the council wants to do thank you yes um so if you're unable to make it to one of our meetings who would be filling in for you we have uh i have three associates that have experience in filling in for meetings for me i can tell you in this so far this year they filled in three times one time was because you all had a workshop that conflicted with one of my meetings for one of the fire districts and the fire district didn't really need me at that meeting so it's it's very it's very rare i have uh the second monday of the month is i have a fire district meeting um at palm harbor so that that was the one conflict but other i will tell you i'm planning on taking a vacation in june i think it's ten days so would probably cover one meeting we don't we don't allow vacations and i won't be taking a vacation in june and you'll have to deal with my wife take it on your retainer today thank you very much back to mike sable uh yes are you board certified by the florida bar and city county and local government law and if not what does that really bring to the table well i'm not my partner is in in civil litigation i would tell you that uh you know individuals study hard for that and they uh actually obtain that i know that um tom and and randy have that and it's an impressive thing to do i really haven't i mean really hasn't any interest for me to do i've been representing my clients for a long period of time um really don't bring on too many new municipalities or government agencies so it hasn't been an issue for me jody shirley yeah i'm i'm good i don't have any questions all right blame gun i i raised the question about retainers and the differences and that and you've responded and i i may have moved the goal post here a little bit and i'm just wondering if mr mora has any further inputs because i don't think we address those questions with retainers to him and i don't know if it's appropriate or not or uh i think the way that i would like to handle this is after uh each uh each firm does their presentation and they've uh they've been they've answered our questions then we'll call on everyone will will have the opportunity to go back to each team and uh and decide uh so uh back to frank baker more questions leslie notaro nothing all right lloyd roberts nothing additional no all right i have no more at this time either thank you very much okay so uh let's go to council and uh uh does anyone have any questions for uh either team at this time glenn gunn i'll just call him mr moore i mean i raised the issue about retainers and i don't know if you have any inputs or insights to what we should think about when several and i appreciate the opportunity to to address that directly first i want to explain we proposed a retainer if you'd prefer to go hourly we're happy to do that we we propose what we thought uh based on having reviewed your your historical billing and otherwise what we thought would be advantageous for you one of the reasons we propose an alt a retainer in this particular community uh as attorney salesman aptly noted in in our experience there are some communities where the cost of using the attorney creates a chilling effect on using the attorney we recently entered another community where we went by the historical billing crafted a retainer and then once we came in found the legal needs were actually exponentially higher once we brought our proactive approach in and people said oh i didn't know you couldn't do that or oh we haven't looked at this policy in a long time and i i still maintain that i think that was the right decision for them and the right fit for them maybe not for us financially in the short term but it's helped them to get where they need to go i say that again to reiterate if this community prefers is interested in working with us and would prefer an hourly arrangement we're happy to do that i will also tell you that while we enter into multi-year contracts depending on what a community wants um we revisit those agreements i mentioned that i'm the town attorney for the town of kennedy city we we entered that community in 2012 because an attorney promptly and somewhat unexpectedly resigned and we came in as interim services just as mr salzman has here and at the time we we had a 4 dollar and then and then ultimately we became their town attorney and we had a four thousand dollar retainer because they had a lot of needs over time they changed their form of government we noticed that the needs of legal services dropped so too did their retainer we adjusted it in light of that and we and we regularly evaluate are is our financial arrangement equitable for both parties both us as a firm and you as a community i would also add excuse me that as we look at the financial arrangement the way our retainer is structured mr roberts to answer a question you asked mr salzman there may be a month where you don't get to that full value and there may be a month where you go over the number is the same there's not a once you reach x amount of hours in our proposal now you're paying over and above the retainer so if you have a month where you bill you only we only give you 15 hours of service within the retainer and then the next month for reasons unexpected you go you balloon to 40 hours it's that same number unless we're doing litigation or a special project something very clearly outside of it we we keep that and that that creates challenges and opportunities for us but we create that number understanding it's sort of the law of averages and trying to to reconcile that for a community but i would tell you that we are most interested in serving you um and and with that in mind we are happy to if you're looking for something more flexible in the financial arrangement happy to discuss that and revisit that however we proposed a retainer based on your needs and while past performance may be an indicator of future behavior we have found in many instances it really is because our approach is different because we tend to be a bit more proactive it can create create more work not make work not not work for the sake of billing and churning but trying to get you ahead at a faster rate rather than just rolling with each punch as it comes in thank you great i have a question for the city manager by any chance would you happen to have the average uh expenditures uh what what we've spent on city attorneys for the past three years i excuse me uh i don't have the last three three years with me but uh in most cases i can tell you that it was uh over three thousand and got up to five thousand the last couple years okay so it's safe to say it's easily it was easily more than 36 thousand dollars in a year yeah oh yes now given a normal term um it would normally be much lower is that correct uh i'm just going to give you the average uh it would probably be somewhere between i'll say 2500 and 3500 so you know but over the last couple years it's been much higher because of the situation i understand all right thank you uh council yes i have a question uh mr warren um specifically we've had uh well let's see two regular meetings we've got this meeting this month we have the traditional council meeting we'll have a work session uh if you cannot make a meeting uh will an associate or a full partner be able to make our meetings it's a great question first and foremost i want to tell you that i make every effort to be at every meeting in kenneth city last year i had more than i want to say i had more than 23 meetings last year i did not miss one um i will take a vacation or you can also deal with my wife at some point uh but where where we try to deploy who's best who's the best fit for your community and for the issues you're discussing i missed my first kenneth city meeting last week for the first time in several months because they scheduled a workshop on the fly and i i did not foresee that coming and had a commitment out of the area i sent an associate but he's our senior associate he's robert eschenfelder he's been a city attorney he's been working as a municipal attorney for over 30 years and he had specialization in procurement and they were doing a solid waste procurement contract so no i didn't send a full partner but i sent the person with the most knowledge who is best positioned to provide them legal advice in the moment so i wouldn't say that i make my decision based on the whether somebody has an investment holding in our business i make it based on what is the best need for the community at the time and it might be it might vary also by is it an advisory board on a preliminary basis this is the first tier you know we don't need to bring that heavy cost to bear that way so there would be a question that you could work with the city manager to find out who is probably best uh knowledgeable about that one topic that would be encountering for that meeting correct and i will tell you that as a general matter of practice i speak to my managers almost every day i uh greg mims down the street and i talk almost every morning on my commuter at least twice a week on my commute what's going on what do you need what's in the hopper whether it's mr reeves or his his successor whomever he or she may be i would be in regular contact have a a firm assessment and even though we've we may have worked on thursday before the monday meeting i will call monday morning and again at three o'clock to say hey anything come up over the weekend anything come up over the business day any unexpected surprises we should prepare for i want to make sure i'm prepared to work with you and especially if i'm having somebody covering my colleague jeremy simon covered an advisory board meeting for me and he and i met for an hour to make sure he was fully versed not only in what was expected but all the things that could happen okay uh mr salesman same question to you can you repeat the question sure absolutely uh your absence you talked about having an associate cover for you uh is there an availability where we could probably get more of a subject matter expert if there's enough time or lead time uh to um support you or represent you when you're not here absolutely it would be no sense for me to send an associate that couldn't help you might as well just not have anybody in the chair um we would have them make sure that they're updated on any particular issues that are coming forward uh lynn and i or lynn's successor um as randy said we will be dealing with them to know what's going on lynn and i talk throughout the week basically to make sure that we're handling whatever needs to be handled or what's upcoming so that we can make sure that we serve the council correctly uh so absolutely i would have somebody here with whatever issues there are and updated for for whatever matters may come before you i have a question for both of you uh mr salzman you could you can stay up for now and answer first um if one of us decided to start abusing the privilege of communicating with you directly and it appeared to be a conflict how would you handle that i would talk to the city manager and i would set up a meeting between that particular council person the city manager and myself unless the issue was dealing with the city manager then i wouldn't do that uh one-on-one conversations i've had those conversations with commissioners over the years normally see it with somebody who might be new and wants to get involved in the day-to-day operations really can't have that have to talk to those commission commissioners individually one thing that you i will tell you is that i try to avoid at any point embarrassing a council member at a public meeting i'd rather deal with the issues privately and make sure that they understand what the ramifications can be over the years and i'm sure you know randy can probably say the same thing no matter what you say somebody's gonna do something anyway uh you deal with it after the fact but we try to avoid making sure that a person isn't embarrassed that we have the answer to the question that they need beforehand and that we deal with any of those issues thank you very much thank you again for the opportunity to respond um it's it is it's a very valid question uh and and sometimes it's it's somebody who's new and wants to get involved sometimes it's somebody who has a lot of time i had a council member once who who suddenly took a much keener interest once they retired uh and and how much we started talking um i will tell you that your rfp seeks somebody who can maintain positive working relationships with internal and external stakeholders with the ability to be politically savvy um it may sound like a bit of a joke but my fraternity nickname was colin powell that was not a drinking story that was just who i was i'm somewhat known for being as diplomatic as possible i may use words with a few too many syllables from time to time but my first step in addressing the issue you proposed would be to have that conversation with that individual directly to say to them listen let's let's talk about what your charter says your code says what your internal policies say remind them hey i was at a meeting where i interviewed for this job and i pledged to you and your peers if it's one of you or somebody new to your peers that i work for the group of them not for one person and if if this is really something you're passionate about let's see if we can make that happen by getting the buy-in of your peers if it if it rises to the level that it's a problem and that no matter as mr salzman said no matter what advice um or counsel you give them that they're not interested in that i would perhaps raise it with your manager but ultimately it may ultimately be something i raised with you folks and say you know i the the services are being used this way it was contemplated that it would work in a particular fashion we're deviating from that if there's been a change in your policies as a council please let me know and so we can adapt accordingly but if not you know there is a certain element and it's not spoken of often and it's somewhat unpleasant to address but there's a certain element of of being on a council being part of a group that requires self-policing uh you know and in some communities you may be in the minority voice and say i don't like where this is going i don't want this to happen but wherever four or more of you go that's where we're going and and i can't change that you're all you're all adults you're all grown folks and you can make your own your own decisions on how you choose to comport yourself in this world and if the four if one of you goes in a certain way and three others say i don't really see an issue with that randy grow some thick skin then that's what's going to happen and i can't change that unilaterally so i i will tell you that i will work with all of my colleagues to make sure you're successful and if there's one person who's doing something that's different than that i'll i will first address it with them i believe in direct conversations uh before elevating things and if they need elevation again just as as mr salzman said as diplomatically as possible i have no interest in being in the public eye that way at all thank you [Music] anyone else no okay uh is it time to uh go to a vote or would you like to have a conversation no everybody good okay well i think it's time to vote then so we have ballot here and uh there's two names on it i need everyone to uh pick one and make sure that you sign your name and uh and then we'll take it account i would like to say this quickly that for us this is a win-win situation from my perspective i mean we have two great options i don't consider either one of the options to be a loser in this scenario it's just somebody who didn't win so again i want to thank everybody for participating tonight and may the best team win actually said you right now okay before uh before we get the the ballot count i'd like to thank both firms for coming out and applying um you're both great uh great candidates and um as mr roberts said we would be truly blessed to have either one of you um i think now we're going to take the the uh role and we'll find out exactly how uh how this uh this this ends up patty uh may we please have the results council member banker voted for mr salzman council member notaro voted for mr salzman council member roberts voted for mr salzman council member shirley voted for mr mora council members abel voted for mr mora vice mayor gunn voted for mr mora mayor gaddis voted for mr mora okay so that's uh four to three and the position is awarded to trask danio llp congratulations and welcome aboard okay if we uh thank you oh thank you so much thank you okay we have uh uh no other uh items on this agenda uh do i have a motion to adjourn who should you adjourn frank banker you have a second leslie notaro all in favor aye we are adjourned thank you"
