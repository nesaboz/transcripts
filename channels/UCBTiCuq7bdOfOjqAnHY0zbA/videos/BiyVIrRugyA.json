vice mayor Jody Shirley here mayor Dave goddess city manager Kyle wafler here um and council member of Belinda Livingstone was unable to attend she should come in on Zoom I sent her an invite she said she was okay so whenever she shows up okay well uh for now yeah it started without her uh I I see that there's a uh a box on the screen here uh I'm just gonna walk over and get rid of it it says got it oh you're gonna do that Heather thank you I didn't didn't want it to be recorded if it uh that was going to interfere with anything perfect no all right uh we have one agenda item on tonight's agenda um uh before we get started I'd like to thank vice mayor Shirley for cheering the last readings my understanding you did a great job so uh so that being said let's move right into item number one discussion and review of fiscal year 2023 2024 budget I hope everyone's out there uh draft budgets that were delivered to their homes and uh I'm going to uh get the floor over to uh Mr reefer thank you mayor um so we're at uh the first budget Workshop and uh the next budget Workshop we're going to have is going to be on July 17th and at that budget Workshop is when we're going to set the tentative millage rate the uh the property values came back estimated from the property appraiser at 10.64 percent increase and our courage our current military is at the 2.0394 um going into the revenues was one on page four um there's one change I need to make from this draft it's uh at the license and registrations for the rental property registrations we dropped that down assuming that the the statute or the state bill was going to pass um but it didn't so our rental registration revenue is going to stay the same so that's going to get changed uh can I ask a favor right quick uh I'm we're probably going to be jumping around a little bit and uh and just to help everyone here uh whenever you change page or change subject would you let us know what page you're on just uh in case somebody was lost okay um and I met a lot of you individually and what I did um through all the uh the uh operating accounts um and departments is really kind of getting closer to what we're spending in our expenditures um and also on the revenue side of the general fund um I bump things up um like a rental registration or I mean the uh facility rentals like where the weddings um it came up today uh where I moved it on page five eight five um we're we're making more money than we're budgeting in Revenue so we pushed it up slightly but it could probably go a little higher um it came up today the question of where we're at to date on the rentals and right now for wedding rentals we're at about 21k um for the uh oh here's Glenda oh hold on one second uh Miss Livingstone has uh joined the meeting can you hear us okay I can hear you but for some reason my video is not working I apologize okay okay um is something looping back around yeah that fixed it okay um so the uh for the total rentals right now we're at about 35 000 on the year Revenue right now we're budgeting uh 24 000 so that could creep up a little bit more um and then uh like I said like when we go through the expenditures for departments um I got them all line item for line item uh um a tighter to what we're spending and that was a goal of mine from last year's budget and uh when I met with you individually we kind of went through each detailed line item um I'd like to get to one of the major points um which is on page 15 which is sanitation department that is our Waste Management uh contract we have a representative from Waste Management uh Tim Bowers in the audience tonight and uh he's here to answer any questions um right now our contract is expiring um this September for the five-year term we have the option to renew but he is predicting higher increase in prices uh 25 is the number I was giving we have the option to renew with them under the new pricing or we can go out to RFP like we did in 2018 but that is uh that's something he came in to answer any questions you have Council first question is going to be we have a four percent cap what up Mr Rayford this is something that we've done um addendums every year on the contract um there is a four percent cap um last year we had to go up more than that uh based on the operating prices the their labor their material costs um something that we've we've adjusted every year I think it'd be a good idea to invite Mr Bowers up to the podium and uh and that way the council can just ask questions directly thank you for joining us Mr Bowers thank you good evening mayor vice mayor council members the government of Affair manager for Waste Management I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening uh please allow me to begin by thanking all of you for your support uh we've had a wrong side relationship with Bel Air Beach over uh the last 20 years uh things are going on with Southwest industry is experiencing Market reset as our other Industries labor operating costs continue to rise in our outpacing price adjustments I think we've all seen inflationary pressures whether it's buying groceries gas Municipal Services garbage trucks rising cost and the impact on the Southwest industry is affecting everyone and everyone in our industry uh the things where we're seeing drastic increases in the price of steel scales used to make trucks deals used to make the beginners that would use the metal containers from my labor costs and labor costs are up and we've had to raise our wages we've also had to raise our benefits we've also had to hire additional HR resources to keep people coming in keep prospecting for for new folks that that will lead in the operation again fuel cost everybody knows what's happening with gas prices you know if you are diesel fuel when we maintenance and truck parts to keep the trucks moving we've had to increase our rates due to these unforeseen unprecedented market conditions which the City race at the time of our contract was executed in the 18 and the continuation of these inflation inflationary pressures we will have to make a ask for a price increase uh a significant price increase uh Waste Management estimates that our contract rate will increase markedly to better keep Pace with the operating cost and Clinical Services in their Community we're estimating a price increase but a low contract price estimated 25 and note that that's that's a lot that's tough and that's why I'm here to talk to folks about it what you know that this is where this is where waste management is we will welcome the opportunity to stress exercise [Music] we can explore options that will reduce costs we have to talk to find out what there might be again uh we welcome that opportunity of [Music] we appreciate your business and you have to continue our partnership I'd like to thank you for considering our request here I'm going to take any questions that you might have uh yes my table uh first of all Kyle is the 24.5 increase is that factoring in the uh the letter from Waste Management yes that that is it's our last contract was at 330 000 and that that estimated 25 increase is bringing up to the 413 000. okay so now the question is going to go right to the we have a franchise agreement with a four percent cap when does that agreement expire the the current agreement comes to term this year it expires so we have an option to renew for five years or we go back out to RFP or somewhere else okay so there's no cap on the coming years no we have to negotiate that okay thank you Mr Banker um I figure we give that 100 pickups a year because we get a pickups on Monday and Thursday we get just about every holiday unless the landfills closed I think last year we got 100. if we knock that down because I'm figuring the pickups that you're charging us right now or three thousand three hundred fifty four dollars approximately a pickup which is going to be increased to about 41.77 4200 on the holidays I'm sure we're paying your guys double time I hope you're paying triple time um double time okay plus the holiday or just double time plus the holiday okay so what I'm saying is that figure now goes to six thousand sixty five hundred if we knocked off like six of those holidays that would bring us into about a 36 000 savings but is that correct or not well we we will take a look at how we put uh we can put a pencil to one time one time a week collection I'm just saying eliminate the holidays that we're paying double time we'd get a hundred I think we had one maybe two not pickups because the landfill was closed okay I think January 1st this year we couldn't pick up so we had to pick up on Thursday so we got credit on that I don't know if there was another one so I'm just calculating about a hundred but there's about another four to six holidays that we also get picked up on because of the change in the government policy so if we took those six holidays and didn't get a pickup I'm estimating about 6 500 hours sixty two hundred dollars we want to take a look at that that's something we haven't thought about but we could look at that all the holidays uh not picking up on those days and take a look at it okay sure just a reminder too is we have Wednesday recycled day so that's another so we really are getting service three days a week okay and I'm just curious how everyone feels about reducing their coverage uh I've I've always been amazed that uh that we did we had garbage pickup on holidays I always thought that that was kind of weird uh at times I was grateful depending upon how much garbage was in the house on Christmas morning but uh um but still I I was always a little amazed that we were offered that service um I will commend Waste Management um you guys are phenomenal you pick up just about anything your guys are friendly they do a great job uh I don't see the litter scattered around the cans whenever they're emptying them um you're phenomenal so I hope that we can come to some sort of an agreement and continue using your services um it doesn't work out doesn't work out but I will say that you guys do a great job I I will I realize this is a big ask but we put the pencil to it we're under all these pressures with inflation and everything going on buying all of the things that supplies on this is that there are things that we need uh and that's why I wanted to to come and talk to you today to let you know that we're looking at that's a ballpark figure uh because we realized that you could go off a bid if you wanted to go off for bid but kind of want to engage whether you wanted to continue to negotiate if you were thinking about you know doing a bit Council brief question may be out of it we'll show you a thought that last year I think we're probably 18 20 somewhere in there on top of millions right how many millions Corporation hit that's a big ask right you guys own the landfill we do no we everything we take goes to Pinellas County okay Mr Roberts did you have a question I do for uh Kyle so Kyle you said 2018 2019 that time training is really uh initiated the current contract of our under correct yes 18. yes at that time did we go out to build yeah we did okay we did we got about five different waste companies been and that was pre-covered correct yes okay okay uh so so this four percent um cap that was placed on it we had no idea what the market was going to do but um I I would say that uh that it's probably fair to ask for an increase but I don't know if 25 is uh is in our real house um but I'm also wondering if it's negotiable on the cap going forward because I think the markets are starting to cool some and uh and maybe uh if we were to swallow some of this and say okay here's our new rate but maybe our cap is a little bit lower than what it is now um we can talk about other things other things to consider I I think um probably it's it's a fair statement to say we'd like to see you sharpen your pencil and see what you can come up with okay and as noted the mayor said costs are coming down last year I think diesel fuel was close to six bucks a gallon now it's 450 425 yeah Mr Tara did you have a question just a comment I would be in favor of negotiating with Waste Management you know the city and waste management you know giving what they can give they've been a wonderful service to us for years and I would I would like to keep them any other questions or comments uh for Mr Bowers I have one additional question you um indicated that there were maybe some cost-saving approaches was that just to cut service is that the only way to save costs is there something else that you had up your sleeve that was that was one but we could also look at you know if there's a possibility of doing something with with the routing of the idea of the holidays came up that we could we would entertain too so we might be once we start sit down and talk there may be some uh other opportunities there that could could help us work up work out a deal okay uh well uh yes um I mean I don't think we're gonna first of all I want to agree with everything the mayor said I've only been here four years and the service that you guys provide is off the chart the staff and you have that work uh for you are amazing that being said I think from our perspective I would have a difficult time answering the question if somebody confronted me a constituent and said Vegeta is why didn't we put this out the bid that doesn't mean we're necessarilying to take the low bid we have a lot of experience and knowledge of what you guys have done for the city but I think at the same time it would be in the city's best interest if we did go out the bid and received uh how many bids how many companies did the last time Kyle just curious what about five okay so we would have an opportunity to review those and evaluate again I've been involved before with this and and you don't always select the lowest bid I mean I take bids from my own projects at my house I don't always pick the lowest bid there's a lot of other factors that melt into that but again it would be a good test to see where the market is sure just for Insanity check right I would still uh Kyle when when do we need to make this decision whether we move forward or put it out for bed uh pretty soon because we're doing at least at least have it advertised for a month um so I got to be able to put it together and then get it in the in the paper it would be in the next council meeting the next regular council meeting or is it that would be okay yeah okay all right well um my recommendation would be to um I would like to give Mr Bowers the opportunity just to see what Wiki something that we can look at as uh maybe a middle of the road kind of thing and if we don't like it or we feel like maybe we need to do uh what Mr Roberts suggested and put it out for bed completely I would uh I'd still like to give Waste Management Waste Management the opportunity to stay on if possible okay everybody okay with that yes yes Mr reefer yes all right thank you very much Mr Bowers I appreciate you coming out thank you I'm gonna get back to our other main contracts we have uh the law enforcement contract um that in this draft for a five percent increase um I got the actual number for this year it's going to be a 7.94 increase so instead of it uh it's going from 549 000 to up to 592. 13 now we're not ready to move on okay this is uh I know I asked this question earlier and I didn't want to bring it out with Waste Management here but what is the cost for services per month per resident for I guess we can only look at the single family because I don't know you know each condo is a little different on the size of a container they have but what is it currently and what would it be at the 25 increase because I think you said that we're charging a little more than one yes yeah so um right now let me pull up I think we charge 48. it's pretty sweet to get that number um and right now with our Revenue um our actual or actual uh revenue for our garbage collection is 342 000. so it's higher than what the 330 or 325 that our current contract is at let me pull this up so bi-monthly the residents for a single family home are paying 48 dollars in their utility bill yeah 25 to that that's what it would be the roughly 1250 increase okay I needed to know I should know that because I have a bill at home but I don't want to pay attention to those details okay please continue thank you okay so the law enforcement contract is going up by 7.94 exactly that is on page 13. and then the code enforcement contract um that hourly rate is going up 7.5 percent um so what I budgeted was uh four percent but lowering the hours to 12 hours per week um which was at 33 000. it'll be more uh closer to 34 700. 750 dollars but I think since the last year we budgeted uh 20 hours per week we started out the whole budget year at 15 hours he was working three five hour days and I feel that uh you can work three four hour days and get yeah enforcement okay so Kyle I'm sorry so back back to the law enforcement real quick what would they just adjusted proposed budget for 2324 B now um so there if you look at the departmental for that there's ten thousand dollars for additional um supplementary Public Safety so um this year's contract was 549 000. and it this year will go up to 592 000 and change uh plus the 10 000 supplement of Public Safety we didn't use any of that this year um but that would be if we if we did something extra um some kind of special detail or speed trap or something where we requested extra service or extra Deputy working okay thank you uh could you repeat 192. yes 586. very good yeah so that that is um that's the first the draft of the budget before I got the actual number so that's a five percent increase plus the ten thousand for the additional um supplemental Public Safety so the next time you see a draft of the budget we'll have the the 592.92 yes I mean two one eleven okay rather than 586 . any questions on law enforcement or code enforcement yeah so we're looking at saving the code 12 000. third dial or the proposal is to dial back uh the contracted services for code enforcement bring more of it in-house than what we currently are so the number of hours you're reducing right Kyle that we talked about this yes okay yeah so last year's budget we had 20 hours per week we didn't even use that this year but we're I'm proposing to come all the way down to 12 hours per week because we did 15 all year okay detail and that that lower um hourly amount in Code Enforcement relates to the full-time position in non-departmental for the admin assistant that I'm proposing um and that would be we had it in there for a part-time 20 per week position at 18 per hour and uh what you'll see on page 12 it reflects um what it would cost for 18 hours per hour for full time and on the detailed it's page 10 on the departmental detail where you can see it broken out and then I'd like to pulling out on page 21 when we get into the general fund Capital Improvement projects that is the uh replacement of the city police that I increase we're at 3 500 per year I increased it up to 6 000 um to stay on track of what a replacement we're gonna have to do with the swim Zone on page 23 that draft shows the computer hardware and software um continuing to be saved at 2500 per year I'm proposing that with the 13750 we have for a good um where we don't need the um have a savings plan out in the out years getting into the capital projects fun or the capital fund um page 38. that Street resurfacing that shows the the note the loan we got into this year um and that shows the portion that 526 uh 200 is a portion of the loan that's going to the street resurfacing and then we're spending it in the top at uh 2024 that's um 676 000. and you'll see the same relation um for these worksheets for in the storm water but in the stormwater fund uh for the valley curb replacement and the stormwater improvements and it's just each portion of the loan that uh we estimated we broke it out and Heather I emailed it to all of you on analysis of the debt issuance where Heather broke out the percentages and um how we're going to attract the interests of repayment loans and then Capital fund page 45 replace City Sea walls um the next sea wall is going to need to be replaced is at South Park but in this current Year's budget in 2025 I wrote I raised the rate of twenty thousand dollars in the savings plan to build up some Capital to do this city hall sea wall if we choose to put one back there to stop the erosion on getting into the marina sun which starts on page 47. go to well if you go to the revenue we're currently from our slip rentals we increase the rate per the resolution uh that we passed a couple years back our current slip revenue is projected to be about 69 000. um if the one uh Improvement plan project is for the uh doc improvements we currently have and that's page 51. we currently have uh 52 000 saved up and we've been saving at a rate of uh seven thousand five hundred dollars per year um with the the 50 of the pilings in the marina that we looked at um go we went out to bid to replace that came back in the seventy thousand dollar Mark um we don't quite have that saved yet but I propose that we at least raise it up to 10 000 per year um to save a little bit more aggressively for when we do need to replace Supply wings page 55 in the stormwater fund again that is the valley curb um you're going to see the capital note Revenue and then the projects um going to be spent at the 731 000 2024. and then same same type of situation in the storm water improvements but you'll notice of the stormwater improvements because this will get us through all the out years that we had with our loan that we got a our Capital uh Improvement Revenue plus a rollover from the stormwater fund Revenue um and then for all the projects being done in 2024. and that really touches on all the main changes um coming up is there any questions on what I talked about Kyle question regarding storm water um currently we have we're charging a maintenance fee to the residents can we get some look at what that looks like and does that fee need to be adjusted any um for the out years come you know as we continue to we do all these improvements but do we have the budget to maintain it moving forward yeah um right now we're we're uh unit so per condo unit per single family home where our assessment is fifteen dollars um so thirty dollars by monthly and that the actual that comes in is that 177 thousand um in-store water assessments the if you look at our um with our stormwater projects and what we're doing um whether our Valley curb replacement plus our other operating costs but it's it's much lower than what the what is needed to balance that but um one thing that keeps going up every year is the 538 46 or 460 that storm drain repairs and other maintenance um that I increase because if you look at it we budgeted 30 000 um in last year's budget um and we're typically spending much more and then that's when we go and we get a Barnacle oyster build up in the pipes and we have to clean jet vacuum out and also when um the pipes start failing and we have to line them um some of some of these problems will get taken care of as we move through with our projects and the different streets that we're doing but there's also going to be um you know a lot of types on Bayshore I have to get um cleaned out on a regular basis they're only 12 inches they tend to accumulate particles quickly um but that's a price I mean I've noticed it just the years I've been here with uh some little septic is a jetpack company that we use but their pricing's all kind of increased sort of like everything else foreign so would it be fair to ask for a budget at least for the Barnacle removal what that looks like for I think City staff does that and then uh I don't know how often you have to hire an outside service to do additional work but at least see what that looks like for City staff and make sure that we're we're at least getting enough to offset those costs so the city staff goes through and they're doing it now uh to on a monthly basis um they go through to each one of those one-way check valves and they you know go down and scrape the Barnacles off them so that they continue to function um anything that gets accumulated in the pipes which is more on pipes that do not have valves on them because the Barnacles get all up into them that has to be contracted out um for you know the truck and the blades to blast it out well so if I'm understanding correctly you just want to you want to explore the idea of making sure that the storm water assessment revenue is enough to cover that ongoing repairs that's right maintenance the maintenance of it yeah because obviously you can see that the 177 175 a year is not going to pay for your big projects that's why we had to take on all that debt right right so guys is the cleaning of the valves is that that's basically in the operating expense is that correct yeah that gets broken up the way it works is um the Public Works employees uh 85 of their um Personnel Services is in the public works department and then 15 of it gets moved over to the stormwater fund I'm sure the estimated portion of work that goes towards stormwater okay so right now we have that that's something we set when we started the assessment the number of 15 of their time is dedicated to the storm water so that's like that's the ratio any other questions just a general question where is the line item that shows uh our mortgage payment for this building okay where's the pages in part of the debt service costs it's on page 30. [Music] I don't know we've discussed this before so this is my thought so do we have an exact if we continue to pay we have a prepayment penalty in this building yeah yes okay so if we extrapolate this out because we're not going to prepay any of it when is the date that it'll be paid off four years is it I mean is there a specific month and day here I think that's the end of 2025 isn't it like December 2025 around that time period of the physical you're talking about yeah we have this question every time when we did the bond issue we we analyzed paying off the building it didn't make sense of the current rates so that that's great news if it's 20 25 that'll be here tomorrow I brought that up make sure that was four years I just brought that up this year they said it was four more years yeah so 2025 is much well yeah two years because we do 40 payments of forty thousand one sixty a year plus interest payments we definitely have to have a big party for that yeah okay thanks I think we're going to get an answer so there's a the full payments go to 24 25 and then there's only a 40 000 and 26 so that could be this is 140. yeah December of [Music] foreign [Music] a half going through every single page on this but um it seems like there were a couple more things that you pointed out I mean the biggest the biggest changes of all was obviously the waste management issue and then uh the uh the sheriff's department their services but was there anything else that was really uh stuck out um I mean outside of the main contracts which kind of outside of our control uh they talked about that additional going to the full-time position that was an increase um everything else I really uh there were some things that came up that increased slightly because we were spending more but a lot I tried to to reduce in each in each account to be closer to what we're actually spending and it does not there's less um you know like excess money left over each year yeah but you had a comment sorry Kyle the insurance you didn't talk about that tonight he had um oh yes that's a good one so the answer yeah the insurance um and it's better to go to the detail which will be a non-departmental page 10. it was a big increase also oh wait sorry page 11 at the bottom is the start of it and then if it's the top of page 12 because the is all the listings and the the highest increase is the property insurance and Florida Legal cities told us to plan on a 75 increase on the property insurance um we all see those numbers until closer like August time period um I have another Municipal insurance company that's going to provide numbers to us to compare so you'll see property um it says Community Center but that's all property in all our Parks um you'll see 75 is what was estimated because that's what they expected to plan on everything else they told me to plan on 10 increase in reliability um you know wind the workers comp to increase 10. okay hey I don't see where it's marked 75 I know there's a supplemental page yeah yeah there we go all right yeah this was there any claims that we made no it's property in Florida it's it's because the storms yeah it shouldn't going up 75 we're paying for uh all the damage down south well that's a win no I drink blood overall damage I've been getting into this general liability property shouldn't have gone up that much have you had any claims in the last two years though I don't think it's a liability it's the structure well he they told him 75 for the property and then the other ones 10 the only claim we ever we've had recently is the um the sign that was several years ago for our property insurance so we've had a negative yeah but they said it's going up based on everything else that's happened in the state and uh have you had any luck with the uh the quote from another company I'm waiting on that and it told me towards the end of the month I thought they'd give you some numbers okay we can compare I think we get slammed if we went with another company with a claim was yeah I think we get slammed because the first thing they ask have you had any claims in the last three to five years goodbye maybe some companies aren't even quoting you are so right what's your zip code that's my renewal so they went out of state and I don't I don't know what happens whenever you you hit this point where you're uninsurable and you have a yeah what happens yeah so what happens when you have a mortgage that's what I'm going to say yeah when you apply close it up to the lender to find one for you oh yeah I think it is and then they really hit you and then knock you out of your you know ability to buy yeah yeah and this is my argument I have been having with Rubios you know Scott yeah good luck I don't care all right I know this uh meeting is ran very short I'm actually I'm sorry that we're not moving into the works of the regular work session next but uh it's scheduled for Wednesday so um does anyone have any other questions for Kyle at this point or for Heather at this point yeah this is just really tangential small stuff we just appointed two new people to the Pinellas County uh was a floodboard Frank something like that I just want to make sure that they got uh money the budget for them is increased I guess for travel and whatever they do no it's just an information you know yeah it's all it's all on uh like a virtual meeting yeah appreciate it no problem again it's a hard one I'll say for the most part this was uh one of the easier budgets to read it was laid out properly I I didn't have a lot of questions whenever I was reviewing it uh of course it helped having Kyle uh spin hours with me but um everything looks for the most part you see up and up and uh really there's not a whole lot to ask about it um I'm hoping we can get this uh garbage collection yeah problem resolved and I also hope that our we can come up with a better quote than what we're getting right now on insurance um Last Chance yes uh former councilman Glenn Gunn there's one of the questions was to him can you put together a budget that we all can understand if you remember excellent job Kyle yep [Music] this is all there is I can hold us until break time last chance to ask any questions or talk about the budget in this meeting all right again a great job Kyle and Heather I appreciate it um all right second yep all in favor"
