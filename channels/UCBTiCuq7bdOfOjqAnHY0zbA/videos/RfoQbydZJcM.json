gaddis interim city manager kyle reefler city attorney randy mora hello thank you very much uh um randy are you able to hear us yes sir you hear you just fine okay great great all right we have uh one item on our agenda tonight and uh that is for final candidate interviews and selection before we get started i'd like everyone to know that we are not hiring a city manager tonight it's also important to know that mr daniels has taken another job closer to home and is no longer interested our only candidate tonight is now mr griffin if this council selects mr griffin please be aware that this will only move us into the negotiations phase of the process and he is not officially hired until the city and mr griffin reach a workable agreement as we interview mr griffin i would advise each of you to not be afraid to ask the hard questions including expected salary and benefits once the interview is completed mr griffin will be asked to leave the room for council discussion once we finish discussions he will be brought back into the room and we will vote does anyone have any questions nope all right uh let's begin uh welcome mr griffin uh would you like to please uh step up and uh go ahead and give some introductory uh statements thank you very much mr mayor it's a pleasure to be here i've enjoyed talking with each of you i've got the opportunity to not only read about the city and your strategic plan and your visions for the city but also a little bit about each of you and uh i'm truly honored to be here you each have impressive backgrounds uh successful careers and uh it's an honor to talk with you um i love municipal work uh a tremendous amount it's basically been my my full career except for more recently as a consulting engineer i love the opportunity to make the make the public facilities public environment make the city better i love doing it in the forum of you the council sets the priorities uh in consultation with input from the citizens and we move forward and we put in place improvements and process in operations in facilities and amenities that serve the public well and make our community stronger more viable continue to maintain its great quality of life and the place to live to live and work and play um that's what makes me happy is to implement your visions for the city to see our citizens enjoy those benefits the things they've asked for to be achieved thank you mr griffin i'm going to ask you just to stay right up there and i would like to go right into questions from the council so let's start with mr banker who is his own president uh good name mr griffin and thank you for attending looking over your resume and your job application um are you willing to take a substantial wage cut which you currently we're earning right now and take this job i prefer not to um i have a nice package of where i work you see my compensation there which is exclusive of benefits and bonuses and i would hope not to take a significant cut and one other question is you've been with um wagner for since 2016. what why during his predecessor reynolds engineering yes yes and then it seems like you jumped around a little bit year to year after that before that that's right but my wife had is a is a phd psychologist and had a wonderful career opportunity in virginia in wagenburg virginia where our daughter lives and i encourage her to take that opportunity and i would do the best i could to get as close to her as i could that as soon as i could so that was a little more difficult than i thought i involved a number of moves but it worked out well and i wound up very close to her and then her opportunity for that same firm was brought her back to florida and she's practicing in florida now so she's still working and she could be relocate somebody's house she is still working uh here in in florida uh she is she is a she's still counseling she's a psychologist here she mostly counsels online though okay thank you thank you mr baker uh next up let's let's call on mike say okay i just want to correct the record uh by the way uh welcome dr griffin i use your phd very uh freely what would be your priorities be for the first three months six months in first year on priority should be your priorities the priorities of our citizens um i think you have it fairly covered uh covered well the things that you've discussed recently and in your strategic plan uh the one item i might mention to you that i think is important is uh with senate bill 1941 passing last year that requires a vulnerability assessment for each each waterfront community i would suggest it would be important to complete that there is funding that would pay for that and then once that's complete then you're eligible for a very substantial amount of grant dollars that the governor has made available to implement any improvements you need to make to make your community fully resilient with climate change so briefly how would you go about applying for those extra dollars that we don't have in the budget um i would i would take the leads or being doing that application um i have the ability to do that um yeah you in your opening statements you said that you reviewed our mission of the city and i wanted to know what would be your number one priority i know you just expounded on one item but what else i mean from a city standpoint you see what our mission is so tell me what you took back took out of that review well i think what each of you ran on i think is i think you had your priorities well lasered well focused and those priorities are a more cooperative congenial atmosphere in terms of how business is conducted and i think protecting and enhancing the quality of life for the for the shoreline and all that means in terms of rules and regulations and negotiations with the json communities i would think those are some of the priorities and as i mentioned i think it's important to um get quickly on the training for vulnerability assessment that's a trend that's being pushed for the last year and um we'll take advantage of the opportunities there and make sure that we've protected the community in a way that needs to be done so that we don't have any negative effects anything else um i know you guys covered this a little bit in the interview previous interview but when i look through your right away it's pretty impressive you have a lot of education but i don't see a lot of practical experience when it comes to being a city manager okay well number of answers to that first of all um besides being a department head for public works and public utilities earlier in my career and city engineer earlier in my career i've been head of the largest water agency in mississippi was also the largest development in mississippi and we operated a 45 mile long reservoir and developed 50 communities fifth department recreation facilities and all the supporting infrastructure and cooperation with um the private sector um so in that role i was operating just like the city manager of a medium-sized city population of about 16 000 budget of about 15 million at the time and of course we had significant capital dates and i was fortunate to secure over 50 million dollars in external funding grant funding appropriations for our community we were the government we work municipality for our 16 000 residents following that i was assistant county administrator for hillsborough county in charge of all the physical side of the county public works public utilities solid waste um community code enforcement and planning and growth management and so that was an assistant role but for all those all of those planning and hard sides of admissible work i've been a county administrator for king william county in virginia a small county of about 14 000 in suburban richmond virginia and i handled all departments 100 employees that we had operated in that full service county and personally handled public utilities myself but no experience in beachfront communities or anything like that just the water works with bringing the closest well certainly hillsborough and grillsborough county has got significant holdings you know on the water we had significant uh waterfront issues the 13 years i served as a general manager of the pearl river valley water supply district in mississippi we have significant shoreline beachfront development issues maintenance issues we had quite a few public features that we operated and maintained i'm quite familiar with that i'm a civil engineer i'm trained in the water area specifically thank you thank you uh louis roberts hi ken and i'm good to finally uh be able to see you and i appreciate the fact that you did send us a picture so that was good we enjoyed the i enjoyed the interview we had me and zoom uh i guess it was a week ago i did i did too thank you so let's say it's tomorrow friday and um you're meeting with one of your best friends after work meeting at one of your favorite places we'll just call him bill and bill says again since you can find it in me of your interest in another opportunity um and you explained to him you know city manager pillar beach and so he asked you you know what's your real motivation for wanting to potentially leave the current position you're in now which is pretty good one and and move on to this new opportunity of a smaller town so so what's your real motivation you know friend and friend that's a that's an excellent way to phrase it i think maybe trying to answer a little more fully to what i mentioned earlier on if you look at my career it's it's been in public service except for the last five years working with the consulting firm what i've always enjoyed is is working with the council working with the citizens and putting those improvements in plans policies procedures facilities putting those in place and then seeing the citizens the residents enjoy those those measures those improvements those facilities that's what makes me smile and been blessed to be very successful in securing the kind of grant money that it takes to make those things happen and my career has secured over 130 million to make those improvements happen because they're always very expensive excellent thank you very much but that's what makes me smile when i can when i can see our citizens uh in riding their bikes pushing their carriages uh swirling on our sidewalks on our beaches that are in good shape and welcoming and taking care of safe that makes me smile excellent thank you yes sir i was looking through your public administrator positions in king william county i went online as it has a population of seventeen thousand eight hundred i think you said sixteen thousand but in any way it's considerably larger than the population of belarus beach bellar is unique in that it's a small totally residential community how do you see actually adapting to that environment you actually i see it being very much the same that sounds like like a big population it's a large county extreme extremely rural even though it was suburban richmond and very small staff covering every single area was only a hundred i know the staff here is smaller but for a county of that size covering every area of public service that a county provides uh i did a lot of the work myself uh for instance i did all the public utility work i was the public utility director and basically the only employee um the um so it's hands-on work it's work you get to do yourself and so that's kind of that's kind of a nice opportunity not only do you get to try to develop solutions to problems but you get to be part of actually physically implementing them and keeps one and keeps one honest so i enjoy that thank you vice [Music] one thing i noticed is that with such a strong engineering background you made the leap to a phd in management and leadership i guess i'm kind of interested in what that [Music] excellent excellent question a couple reasons um you know one is you know as an engineer i think a couple of you may they will understand this your coursework is is full of technical courses but if you're good as an engineer you very quickly move to a management position but you get to do that without having any leadership or management courses so that was one of the reasons i realized i was moving in this direction in a management capacity and i really wanted some training and how to how to do that job well and do that job state of the art and so it's one of the reasons i went back the other reason was it was right there in jackson mississippi our our community of 15 000 15 000 was uh just in suburban uh jackson mississippi um and uh university of mississippi offered a program that i could take right there in jackson and only we have to be on campus for three summers so i had to drive a lot for three summers but otherwise i had a relatively short drive i guess the other last thing to tell you is that when i went to cornell and got my master's in terminology that's a study of lakes and streams and reservoirs fresh water chemistry biology physics et cetera i um i felt bad that i decided to leave and not get a phd i had the opportunity to i had a full scholarship could have stayed as long as i needed to to do that but i realized i didn't want to be a researcher because i wanted to be hands-on i wanted to solve problems i wanted to run agencies the way that took care of problems correctly and so i i stopped at the master's level but i always felt bad about that so when things came together i had this opportunity that made sense to get a phd i jumped on it right away and very pleased that i did got to work with the dean of the school of engineering after i finished and we developed a management track for engineers getting their masters at the university of mississippi and i taught in that program for a while and i guess the final blessing was that in this program this phd program i met my wife and we've been married ever since so so most of the jobs or positions you've held you you've had some sort of boss find cover for you you've had some large staffs and some some large interrelational stuff with other departments and stuff like that but my question is so your experience is a lot of phd stuff and you've done some of that stuff in your jobs with the other departments and positions you've helped but you're about to jump into the political frame now and my question to you is do you feel like you had the experience and you're ready to be the guy who sometimes there's no pleas at everybody they'll be pushed from every side everybody's got your opinion everybody's going to try to tell you how to do your job are you ready and assertive enough to say thank you i've got it and i know how to do this i'm very comfortable and experienced with that pretty my whole life i've worked directly for a for a council commission a board the 13 years i was the general manager of the agency in mississippi i mentioned i reported directly to a 14-person board highly political that board represented five counties and four state agencies took a lead role as an assistant county administrator in hillsborough county the county administrator pat bean had each of us aca is very actively involved with the city council on all the issues that fall in our area certainly as county administrator for king william county i reported directly to a five-person board a tremendously political environment in that area with the battle between the different political persuasions that existed in that part of virginia so i'm very comfortable with that and i recognize the job that you have you each have a very difficult job and you bring different experiences and different wisdom to uh each challenge that you face each problem that you face and um and my job is to is to follow your direction the direction of the full council and i know in doing so uh you might have a vote that's 4-3 to go in one direction when i do that i realize that maybe the three that didn't want to go in that direction won't be happy even though i'm following the overall council's direction i'm used to that but i try to find a way to try to find a way to meet all the council members needs i try to find a way to say yes to solve problems the way that they need to be solved i've been successful doing that i'm comfortable doing that thank you thank you i have a couple of questions for you looking at your resume i say that your current position is substantially higher than what we paid our our previous city manager can you tell me exactly how you would be able to fully justify if if we hired you at your current salary i'm not saying that that's going to happen but that's what you're implying you would like to make happen so what would you do with the city of bel air beach to justify that type of pain that's a that's a very good question a couple couple two answers from that one is certainly being a small city we can't afford to be hiring consultants like i get to hire now to to do work to make applications uh did you deny this to uh develop plans um those dollars ten twenty thousand dollars goes just like that those contracts are typically much larger than that so i can save a tremendous amount in that regard avoid a lot of costs that you might otherwise have to incur if you are using consultants to assist you with some major initiatives second of all if you're successful in those initiatives that usually involves money to implement them and that is extremely expensive especially compared to the budget that we're facing in the capital budget that you have and so i have a strong track record of securing outside funding grants and appropriations partnerships that would be many times over what my salary would be so i mentioned to you for the agency that i led in mississippi for 13 years secured over 50 million dollars almost 55 million dollars for that agency was about a 15 million annual operating budget agency when i took the position i was i was in upstate new york leading an electric water and wastewater utility there board president called me up three days afterwards after i had already accepted the job and he said you know there's something we haven't told you a couple things we haven't told you um one is we're not doing anything uh we have no plans policies procedures we got we have no vision we want you to develop a very ambitious strategic plan and vision for us in all areas of our operations and do that in cooperation with us and our residents and number two is uh we're broke our entire capital budget for all aspects of full soca city was two hundred thousand dollars wouldn't pay for a single roadway so he says we need you to develop this attractive vision strategic plan and then find the money to implement it and uh if you talk with him earl walker uh he'll tell you that we did exactly that we developed a series of very ambitious worthwhile uh strategic plans and then found the money implemented every single one of them and our residents and citizens were extremely happy they were shocked how well things went how much how quickly things improved that's great as you know bel air beach has no commerce to speak of and we're definitely not the place for low income housing the combination of those two factors being removed from our city many times disqualifies us from grants because they're trying to push the economy or housing so what type of grants would you pursue if you were our state manager the um what's happened in florida last couple years is they've made tremendous number of grant dollars available in different programs for storm water for resiliency for drainage for flood protection for community rating service improvements and so the opportunities are there like they never have been before and i think it's the right way to go the governor and the legislature have i think have led the state in the right way and many communities are fully embracing that and making really great things happen and so i i think which would qualify well for those those don't come as far as i know with those those limitations because you're right those limitations are very hard to address thank you let's go back to uh council member langer i have no further questions right back to mike sable sure um can i understand where you're coming from uh i was a commissioner of prison george's county so up in maryland so i understand what you're fighting against down in your county but um got a pretty pointed question we have a young man um kyle that's filming right now and he has solid experience but what we really need is somebody to mentor and lead him and i see your experience background and mentoring how would you go about you know developing a mentoring plan for him for having him milestones overall career movement how would you go about doing that well the the same way that i you know i've done that you know in other situations and you know i had my training in that result of the phd work that i that i did in human resource development i guess first of all it starts by saying that you know i'm not going to be here forever i do expect a significant amount of time to meet your needs and i so i think that kyle is not going to have to wait that long and so now's a good time to to work to move things forward for kyle um and it starts by sitting down and and listening to kyle in terms of you know what his his interests are his strengths uh where he would like to go uh how he would like to grow um and um you know i do it in an intelligent way you know reviewing the products he's produced and his resume and his background and we cooperately work together and develop a plan for having how he can grow i'm a real believer in continuous growth and improvement and i've you know i've taken additional training and courses and certification my whole life and here in florida being a highly regulated state you know we really need to do that we really need to keep current things are changing so quickly especially on the storm water and flood control side in in florida so i think there's lots of opportunity for growth and kind of can be a true expert or true leader and be your next person that's what you'd like to have thank you councilmember shirley so just a couple of questions for you keep referencing florida i'm really having a hard time piecing together your timeline how long have you lived in florida i mean it looks like you were here from 2006 to 2011 and you were gone for a while and then you're back that's we bought our house when i came to hillsborough county um i bought up on the house in tampa and harbor island uh in 2006. i've kept the house ever since and i kept that as my permanent residence we have in 2011 uh we took the opportunity that allowed my wife to join a very prestigious private practice in virginia and that's when i went to the south carolina but we've been back now for a good period of time when did you move back we came back in 2016. to now you never that's right okay um have a pretty strong background in the nonprofit world and um it's not unusual to hire someone pay them a little more than what we have in the budget and say you go find the rest of your shower and you go out and raise money which it sounds like your answer on the grants was part of that rate that helped solve some of the short problems with funds but when you're when you're seeking grants it's typically helpful to be politically connected in tallahassee in dc do you have any connections in those areas yes yes i do and to some extent you know i might very selectively want to rely on some folks that i know that hire them to assist me in some of those efforts to make sure that we're successful that would be a very minor expenditure but yes i do have good contacts in the county in the region and with the state but you're exactly right the game is played technically and politically council member yes so so can i know on your um application you would mention your salary plus bonuses i'm familiar with how that works typically could you share with everybody normally like maybe give us a one year example clearly it's based on the success of your company normally how does that work and especially based on your role in the success of the company but um in a good year when the company's done well and you've done well for the company your bonuses could be 15 in that range i'm not looking i'm not looking for that to be a part of what we're negotiating i would like not to take a cut in terms of actual solver all right that's better and i would like to just make a couple of statements um as you know i'm a civil engineer as well and um one of the best compliments i think i would ever received as i was progressing and i would meet somebody for the first time and through conversation they would find out i was an engineer and typically they would say something like golly you don't you don't really talk or act like an engineer which i considered a compliment and i can tell already from listening to you speak and your experience and how you handle things but i think you would receive that same company you typically have the technical expertise but i think you also bring to the table and hopefully york city the ability to be able to interact with our citizens in a way that's not typically associated with an engineering personality and i'm confident he will so i understand you exactly yeah i've been i've been fortunate to get a similar compliment i think it helps to have come from the background i came from was i started as a biologist a chemist getting a degree in master's in technology and so i come in as a scientist who went back to school and got the engineering degrees and then decided that i needed to be a better leader and manager and went to got some more training in that way so yeah i'm blessed to have that and in the public forum you better have the ability to listen and come up with alternative solutions and find a way to get in place council member ontario i have no further questions makes me are good let's circle back to grants for just a moment it seems like one of the pushback we've always had when we seek grants is the financial demographics of derby because when you try to factor into this that they form the love how they intended out to grant money we typically come up wanting because we don't meet the needs of the financial structure it kind of kind of favors the lower financial demographic so it there's a challenge there for you is that that's a remarkable pearl yeah i'm thinking that you know what i'm seeing a real push down which is on you know flood prevention hurricane prevention storm water problems which are enormously complex in terms of the physics of the chemistry the coastal resiliency they they don't know uh those problems don't notice income levels and so the grants that you know these problems need to be addressed you can be planned for need to be addressed and they're not income related now maybe it's difficult uh some some other things we might say you want to get a downtown grant rehabilitation grant we don't have a downtown but we might have if we're applying for something like that that would be maybe difficult if we're looking for uh you know maybe a a grad to build a trail you know we might have difficulty competing with that because we don't have the right economic demographics but i don't think we're going to be doing too much of that the uh you you are an icma credential city manager what does that bring to the game for us um that's a good question it certainly requires the right education training and the training is continual it's quite substantial to continue education requirements that you have to complete and document and significant experience requirements where you move through the process and become fully credentialed there's a very significant code of ethics that we all must abide by there are tremendous resources that are provided literally daily to city managers by icma and numerous publications and online notices that provides you with all the resources you could possibly need to address any problem and so you're addressing different difficult problems that maybe you haven't dealt with before you can quickly see how other communities like you have successfully addressed them and so it's a tremendous resource the city managers are not only very active in their continuing education but they're also very active in helping each other they get tremendously involved in publishing presenting making available the solutions that they've implemented in the whole problems in one previous position you were you initiated and implemented a management dashboard yes key performance indicator metrics right that's right one of the things we struggle with is we don't know we're getting better and we don't get if we're getting worse so what sort of metrics for a small municipality like this would you envision well i would do it um you know area by area disciplined by discipline we might take parts and we might and together with the citizens develop um what those metrics what so those meaningful metrics might be for our parks for instance um i probably could develop that and give you give you a proposal a suggestion about these metrics and here's some other metrics that you might consider and see if you like those metrics and then once we once you decide what metrics you like we adopt those we develop a mechanism in place where we collect the data for those metrics and we develop a mechanism to share and present those metrics so that you and the citizens and our employees can see those metrics something you believe in or they just force on you by management well i think that's where you really want to work with the citizens with the employees with the council and come up with metrics that are that are truly meaningful if i operate in a vacuum especially about some areas that i i didn't know all that well i could certainly come up with some poor metrics and uh you're right municipalities have come up with some more metrics and then we're chasing our tail and not getting done what needs to get done okay uh with your vast knowledge and experience you take that and you couple it with the fact that city managers are in high demand in pinellas county what's the attraction what what makes you want to work with bel air beach as small as we are it seems like you would be bored after a while well you know that i wanted you close two is i really do enjoy a beachfront community that's i certainly have passion for that i live on the water myself in general and parker island i think it'd be hard to reward because there's not that many of us to do the work so i have plenty of work to do and plenty of challenging problems to uh try to suggest solutions to so i don't see that boring at all so you would be a hands-on city manager i think you have no choice with you know given the size of our staff the size of our budget i think that's what we should expect that's what i would expect thank you let's go back to frank baker do you have any questions um our previous city manager or city manager they get right out into it they go out sometimes doing landscaping they both worked endless hours filling sandbags during hurricane season is that something that you would uh get into too yes yes that's part of that's part of being dedicated to what needs to be done plus as you as you mentioned the manpower is needed council member disabled okay uh doctor um and citizens i just want to be clear here when we became elected we wanted to make sure that we assure the citizens that we would accomplish all due diligence we would do our homework uh to this point it may seem short that there's only a few questions each but i need to reiterate tonight's really the culmination of work by a committee they reviewed each and every resume we worked with them to compile a way to rank the resumes we then each of us you know read all the resumes read the background and rank that um this is not the first time we've been in front we've had a session prior to this where we asked and answered many questions i mean myself i'm just tattling along over you know 12 very specific questions that you have answered truthfully up front and in great detail you know showing us that these accomplishments that you've had the resumes are available just amazing i wanted to thank you for that but i just wanted to make that very clear to the citizens that this is just not a one night standard that we've done an enormous amount of work to get to this point having said that i have no further questions of you thank you very much knocker i realized i realized that and i know uh i applied back in late april i think i checked it with patty once to make sure that something hadn't gone wrong they are working very hard and be patient and i said happily so i want to guess definitely with that and i want to also reiterate one simple thing but it means a lot to me it's you were frankly the only candidate that came back with a thank you note appreciating you know our time as a council and as a city for the time that we spent with you the last time we met so thank you very much well thank you yeah i've realized the hours that each of you put in it's it's a very demanding job and i can tell from what you uh what you talked about when you were running for office that you were serious you were serious about about doing the job and you knew what the job involved the hours it took to do it and you know i've been this kind of job long enough right i see a little heart a good board a good counselor works and uh when a good counselor works with a good city manager it's amazing the things that you can get done and then we all celebrate we all smile thank you council member shirley yeah this is more just a statement and uh you know glenn had it or something i'm not sure if it was my question but how would you justify your salary you went through a list of things and one of the things you said was you know we're spending money on engineering consultants and that sort of thing i just want to be clear we're hiring a city manager not an engineer we appreciate your experience and knowledge and i'm sure we'll pull from that quite a bit but not to get um sideways and that we rely on you for engineering because that's not what you're hired for so you know that's i just want to kind of clear the air there because we've had some situations in the past that professionals thought they were being they could use their professional criteria credentials to assist council and that wasn't what they were on council to do so um and i just thank you for your time i appreciate the opportunity to meet you because i wasn't on the call but thank you again for your time thank you thank you i've enjoyed the good questions tonight council member roberts so if we get to the point where everything is um we've offered you the position and we've negotiated everything that needs to be negotiated at that point how much time notice you think you will have to give what you would you want to give to your current employer something on the order of two to four weeks i'm thinking about thank you and again thank you i won't have any more questions but thank you so much for your time and your answers have been um very thorough and i appreciate that thank you i've enjoyed it i get to talk to three engineers looks like tonight at least three council member doterra i have no further questions vice mayor guys you're a technology guys i'm just kind of curious yours is the only application that's hand written and what we tried to do a zoom meeting the other night would seem to have difficulty so i'm just kind of wondering what's going on here yeah i guess maybe i'm a little old-fashioned and i was taught early in my career that if you want your application to stand out you you do it by hand i have pretty good printing still have pretty good cooking earlier in my career i used to before we had computers i used to actually letter our drawings myself and didn't have to use any guides to do the lettering so i just have kind of always gotten in the habit of printing okay thank you for that and one last question is uh you know the balls around the salary i mean you're you're a little compensated guy out there in the engineering consulting group and let's do a thought experiment here for a second you're sitting up here looking at hiring the next city manager and obviously you're budget constrained so the question revolves around what is a real world possibility is and we're looking for best value and there's no problem in hiring a person who's going to bring back a return on the city's investments in salary wages and compensation that's no problem but the question is is are we going to get our money's worth and our return how do we ensure that so would it be out of the question for a city council to think about some sort of paint structure where we had the ability to observe for a period of time and compensate for the bonus to catch you up to where you are um i i'm not expecting you to tip your hand for negotiations for purposes but i'm just saying that is that a real world consideration for the people staying up here it would be i think it'd be hard for me to leave my current situation if that was the direction we were going to move i think i think my wife would have many things to say i'll leave it there thank you very much for your time it's been a pleasure thank you very much you're you're also dedicated and sharp and uh congenial thank you very much okay the uh the last question i have we've discussed bonuses in pay and benefits what obviously in a municipality we normally don't do bonuses we have a salary and uh and then about the only other benefit is a car allowance um if we were able to meet your salary requirements would that be accepted yes as i mentioned earlier i wasn't i i understand how municipalities work and the bonus is just it's not part of the system it doesn't work that way so i wouldn't wouldn't dream of that thank you i don't have any other questions but i will say uh it's been a pleasure to interview you and uh i'm going to go around one more time and see if the council has any other taken questions a debate all right um council member banker any questions any greater question there all right council members able no further questions mayor all right judy surely no no further questions that's michael roberts you know sir tara no thank you [Music] all right uh it sounds like we are ready to enter the discussion phase that we don't feel like we're staring you down while we're talking about you i'm gonna ask you just to have us feed out the hall you'll be able to hear what we're discussing and i'll call you back uh whenever we're ready to take the vote um before we get started with discussions i'm going to need a promotion to take a vote for our single candidate do i have a motion [Music] mr roberts you have the floor we did have an opportunity as mike mentioned earlier to apologize for that not doing nuts but so we did spend some time significant time with ken at another interview process he did very well then i think he did exceptionally well tonight i'm confident that he can do the job i really appreciate the fact that the skill sets that he brings to the city if we select him and from a standpoint of having hands-on and potentially actually doing some of the engineering services himself as well as we do this on decide to outsource some of the engineering services his ability to overlook what they've delivered to us will be phenomenal so i think he's the main guy thank you um council member in ontario um i i have a problem with the salary range and we're hiring a city manager we're not hiring an engineer i think that seems to be his strength as an engineer any other comments thank you councilmember baker i have like three problems and um i don't know if they're petty or not but um this as one member brought up about being able to get one zoom he couldn't get one zoom last week i have a big problem with that i'm not a computer guy but i know how to get on zoom the other problem i have is a thank you letter he wrote he misspelled our mayor's name um that you know you you that's simple research um when you're trying to be hired on that the chief officer that you're being interviewed with you know [Music] second of all is counting work on kings williams county it's 2015 to 2016 did he start in december and quit in january you know that's a very short time um his salary range is something that we've all said no way we're going to even discuss and debate uh he does bring in these grant opportunities which i don't think i don't think they really fit the city at all we're already getting grant money in that for uh flood that lynn already achieved in that i don't think there's much more to be found out there but that's my uh that's my input thank you very much uh council members looking at again going all the way back to the resumes and after talking with him he not only brings the engineering but the leadership i mean he basically built a program for engineering leadership and he's correct the engineering when you're working at it you know as i've done it's you don't break out a slime rule those are very special people that you keep off to the sides what happens throughout your career progression and he's at that phase is you're a leader you have people that actually break out of the slide rules and the slide rules are really only that first five years after that you're overlooking budgets you're overlooking development of people you are looking at the big picture if you're not you're no longer there as a consulting engineer that's what you do you look at the big picture you lay out the plan if you're not laying out a productive plan you're not going to get hired because that's contract work so looking at all the other candidates frankly this is a very strong candidate and i can't emphasize enough just how much qualification and experience he brings to this city that's it mayor thank you very much council member shirley so i just have to question are we in such support of this candidate because he's last man standing and i go back to how we really taken this process seriously have we talked to the right candidates have we gotten correct candidates in front of us i was going to kind of leave that out there so something to think about um there are some concerns on um salary but you know i think i would consider that something we can overcome if it's the right person not sure that he's the right person there are some things in the background check but i don't want to say in a public forum but if you look at page four you can see some history that brings a lot of concern to my mind we have the the information in front of us and as i went over earlier i have no problems discussing difficult topics would you please reiterate he's going to be running our budgets there are several delinquencies i don't i don't want to expound anymore if you can't read it i don't know what to say you know you all should have the ability to read these reports so if i'm just going to say um i would be in favor of going back out to the community hire a professional to help us seek the city manager that can meet the needs of our city thank you very much vice mayor good idea i think he's very articulate well spoken i think he's got a lot of qualifications that we can use i'm not concerned about the salary i think you are making an investment if he brings a return on that salary which i i have some level of confidence that he will then we're for the better for that at the end of the day a city manager serves at the pleasure of the city council and obviously we have an opportunity to judge and wait and performance i'll be the first person to say it's easier to hire than it is to fire but that said we still have the ability to observe and move on from there again i'm not concerned about the salary i i think he's well qualified for the job i like what i earn tonight and i think there'll be a good return on the investment thank you what i see is i see a potential to correct some problems that the city has had with capital projects there i have always felt that they have not been completed in a timely basis i feel like this city deserves better than what we have done in the past and that is not a uh that's not saying anything of negative about people that are currently handling those projects um i just think that uh with someone of this caliber of experience those projects could very well happen much faster and our city would benefit in ways that we've not seen in a long time also council member shirley questioned the hiring process so not the first person who's brought that up the citizens advisory committee also questioned um the hiring process however after the zoom meeting that we had with the four candidates i had two citizen advisory committee members come up to me and i think one of them even spoke publicly that said actually the process worked out better than i expected and i think that we narrowed it down to two very impressive candidates unfortunately one of those candidates decided to take another position closer to home and i don't blame them so i feel like the process has actually worked now there has been a suggestion that we should scrap this and hire a head honor well as if if anyone here has used a head honor service i think the going rate is about 20 well there's your first year of a salary increase they order we're debating on whether we would consider hiring this guy for that salary so one way or the other the city would be spending the money with a head hunter spending the money with mr griffin or we would completely start the process over again and go right back through the citizens advisory committee with the exact same process again so i i have my feelings are is that mr griffin would be a worthy investment for our city i think that this may not be a long term engagement i i can't guarantee that he would want to stay around but i see that there are many projects that he would be very useful to our community and and i would have no problem hiring him so now that we've all spoken one time let's go to the public for comments would anyone like to speak hey mayor council of agreed uh councilman was able to comment that a lot of people put a lot of effort in this process i totally agree with a couple things you know i did present to you my personal feeling earlier on that should scrap the process and get a recruiter i still feel that way very strongly i feel that what i'm hearing tonight is we're we're putting a square peg into a round hole so we found an engineer that could be very beneficial for our city but as a city manager and i don't think we've found a city manager that fits ultimately what i think our city should have i'm after the discussions over budget that i've observed everybody on to feel that it's okay to put a 40 increase into the salary when uh i think some of the comments were who wouldn't want to work here for 100 grand i think we really need to formally know what the right salary range is um and then not sell for a warm body and demand just what it feels like from my perspective and i didn't go in record first but rossignol uh 22-19 thank you very much any other citizens yes sir mr davis brittany davis 612 well after first thing i want to say is how absolutely wonderful it is to sit here and listen to this council with this broad base of knowledge go through calm deliberation very thoughtful process it's just wonderful to hear what i listened to in the last three years thank you um as noted i've been on three city manager selection committees um the process a lot of times is what's available at the time that you're in need i think there's no question that this gentleman has the skills having been a assistant administrator in hillsborough county he's got that political background he's dealt with it he spoke very clearly on how he would work with you and the residents and that's important the hang up seems to be is he perfect for us think of our size and the number of people that people would want to apply here and look at what you've got in front of you or i don't know maybe i'm going to throw a number out there 35 40 000 over where you'd like to be maybe less 25 he can easily save you that money it harkens back to the first city manager that we ever selected reach civil war um we were fortunate that he came to us for what the salary won because he wanted to be here but it wasn't long before one year when people saw the value of his experience and knowledge and treasure island bought it away from us for a significant salary it was i think thirty thousand forty thousand dollars more than what we were paying inflation is a new era it's time to step up very carefully you can pay this salary but very carefully set a plan where you can justify to the residence of the city that you paid that price because he saved you the difference in money make that a strategic part of your strategic plan in this final note the city has never put down a good solid city manager evaluation program and that needs to be in place because you can't let him work for a year and then come back and based on your own particular whims start judging him you set the plan first say these are our objectives these are what we're going to store you with and on and then at the end of that year you use that as your blueprint for making a judgment i am so pleased to hear that you're going to put in the fact or you're interested in putting into effect a plan to bring kyle more education more training more experience with the objective that down the road he could be our man he always has to you know stand up to the same process of evaluation as the others that are available but i don't think we need to go back through this process again you're not going to find that perfect guy if you do you may be out in you know middle america somewhere and what we've got is someone that's a local person local experience and that's key to running a beach community thanks to the other service appreciate it thank you mr davis yes sir mike kelly mike kelly 2740 high business drive west i'm not going to dwell on the salary to debate you folks have analyzed it you've you've looked at it hard and if you choose this person and if savvy comes down to be a salary issue that is that is your choice and i'll back you what happens my concern is is this person whether it's this gentleman tonight or anybody else that you ultimately hire going to be able to work in the trenches i'm calling it that because people like kyle and lynn and past people that have worked for the city have to be able to work with our citizens who um i won't say unfortunately come in but you know that at the county there's people that come in that want to talk to the city manager and even if you've got a project going you've got to make time to come to that counter and do it so the person you hire should be somebody that can get out of his ivory tower and come to that counter and make that person comfortable or make an appointment or delegate penny or someone to have that person come back because your 2000 citizens want to be able to get in and talk to our new leader and that's so so important if a person has a terrific salary terrific credentials can't interact with this small community and be able to jump in his truck i hope as opposed to whatever and go see somebody at their house with their issue that is a administrative problem or an administrative concern to that citizen that person is going to start to fail to keep the respect of our local citizens on a regular basis and that that that is a fact in who you choose thank you thank you mr kelly any other comments all right let's go back to the council and we will give lloyd roberts the last word thank you mary there was a comment made um are we just taking this person because of the last person standing i believe parenting started what 23 28 28 28 applicants so certainly we're not taking the last person standing we had 28 to begin with and we narrowed that down to four and then we narrowed that down to two one of those found another job they were leaving us with this individual so we started with 28 there's a lot of work put into it we're not just accepting somebody because they're here um using the recruiting consultant i've had some experience in that area i've seen a lot and normally what happens with that is you hire this firm to come in and they reference about twenty thousand dollars typically that consultant puts together a really nice package this is why it costs so much money and they're attempting to lure people that are currently working at a lower salary than what you're going to offer and that's why you're doing this so you're not going to lure them typically away from their current job using a recruiting consultant by offering them less money than what they currently market or it doesn't work that way so that particular tool has a specific niche and i don't think our city fits in that niche to use a headrunner recruiting consultant tool for that and i think it's a shame that sometimes where we're trying to say this individual has too much engineering experience and we're using that against him he has an icma certification it doesn't get any stronger than that he has county uh leadership experience i'm not a specific city manager but he has a county administrative position he's got the experience in that area as well we shouldn't penalize this person because he has a strong engineering background that's an additional positive thing that he brings to the table thank you yes [Music] would it be out of the question to alter the structure of this process just a little bit to bring mr griffin back in to address the shirley's issue and mr kelly's issue because i'd like to close the loop on this i think all the stakeholders need to be comfortable with these issues and the decision we're about to make so my question in the process is could we bring him back in here for about five or ten minutes to address the issues that surely brought up and i'd like to address mr kelly's question i will allow that one other thing is just it's been mentioned a couple of times and these were mr griffin's words exactly was that kyle will not have long have to wait that long i mean there's it seemed as though he intended this to be a short stay it's very expensive to bring someone on a new hire onboarding is expensive costly to get him up to speed if he's coming in with that mindset it just brings him to the concern why don't we bring him in and let's let's ask those questions mr griffin would you please come back in sir did we chase him the council has a uh a few more questions for you mr griffin would you mind stepping up to the podium please let's uh let's start off with jody shirley just a couple of questions um when you were asked about mentoring kyle your words were kyle will not have to wait that long and my concern is we have a it's very costly for us to go through the process of onboarding a new hire there's a lot of expense and a lot of time involved my concern is that you're looking at this as a short-term say based on that good question and i and i had a i have a funny feeling that i didn't phrase that properly uh what i did say in fact i was thinking about it out there um i didn't hear your discussions by the way i'm looking at five to ten years working in the five to ten years stay in this capacity and yes i recognize that and it takes that kind of time to get to get the things done that you want to get done this question is not as easily posed patty does do you have a copy of the background that patty provided us with we have an extra copy can you give him a page for just because i don't want to page for you more i don't want anything so on these pages you can see there's um several accounts that had multiple delinquencies and my concern is as you know running a budget for a city credit means a lot and so i'm just concerned about how many delinquencies in that time period when you clearly indicate you were thankfully employed and the wife was employed and so just kind of curious about that all those all of those items are fully up to speed down many of them in fact are fully gone whatsoever paid in full i have no delinquencies not laid on anything current on my mortgage okay i think i think my credit rating is quite good yeah i just i don't know how you have uh 90 120 days things like that so i'm just wondering how that how you know how that happens but that's fine okay thank you oh this is taro yes yes um i think you said that you looked at this as being a five to ten year situation and looking back at your employment history you were in king william county from 2015 to 16 town of smithfield from 2014 to 15 hillsborough county 2006 to 2011 a five year a one year and a one year well those were actually what the those are actually two-year engagements and as i indicated i encouraged my wife to take the opportunity that was offered they heavily recruited her it's truly a wonderful firm for her to join practice to join and i said i would get as close to you as i could as soon as i could i didn't realize maybe how difficult that would be it did require a number of changes until i finally was able to get right there to virginia so that's what's required but as you say prior to that i was i certainly was with coast guard county almost six years uh i was with the large agency in mississippi for uh 13 years and uh prior to that earlier my career long engagements as well thank you very much mr dr griffin one of the residents brought up an issue about accessibility one of the streams of your possible criticism reeves was he was always successful highly personable extremely adept at customer relations and service to the community always accessible and he wasn't afraid to roll up the slaves and engage when it was an all-hands-on-deck kind of evolution and we just want to know maybe you can touch on some experiences that would give us confidence that you're also that sort of person that's yeah excellent question that's that's the way that the job gets gets done well it's with connections it's with it's with listening it's with uh taking to heart bringing uh bringing opportunities and challenges and potential solutions to you and moving forward and addressing those concerns give a good example of two examples when i was a head of the agency for 13 years in mississippi we developed 50 communities around this 45 mile long reservoir and these were these were communities each with very active homeowner associations and they they met regularly in the evening on some of the men on the weekends and i made sure that all 50 of those i saw all 50 of those um once or twice a year every year for all those years that i was there and i enjoyed that that's how we got things done because the residents know what needs to be done they the citizens tell you what needs to be done and you listen you formulate solutions you work together as a team they help you get things done and so i'm yeah i'm very comfortable with that and as you indicated this is a hands-on job so that goes hand in that goes hand in hand with that firsthand listening do you know that's all questions from the council uh yeah i actually do but none of you uh attorney maura are you online right now uh have all our questions been uh illegal and uh reasonable at this point uh i i think your questioning has generally been reasonable your candidate has been very amenable to answering and responding to the process it is a difficult process all the same uh um uncomfortable with how we proceeded thus far okay you have a question because normally in interviews i don't get into somebody's credit rating um even security clearances we tend to shy about that to the last minute i i i think that your question was the question was attempted to be asked in the most discreet way possible um i understand that point there is a slight difference in the public enemy and public funds and and your futures in that regard and a general sense i prefer we got back to the the conversation at the end we're not going to you know start making legal positions for the community thank you very much okay hold on one second or dude was that the same so so randy this is lloyd um i think was a short time ago we were having a conversation the counseling council yourself you may have provided us with some statistics regarding what the normal length of time that the city manager typically stays working for a city i think it was in the state of florida do you recall that time yeah so that wasn't a statistical study done by me but it was information that i've heard repeated by portland city personnel on multiple occasions as i've sat through additional recruitments my my exposition to you was that manager candidates in florida tend to average historically close to somewhere between four and seven more recently between three and six years in the community that tends to do more with political turnover than specific departures but the circumstances are each unit each situation is unique to itself but it is uncommon to have 10 years of you know 15 20 years so i know you might be personally familiar with somebody that's been fortunate to do that um in a general sense ten years tend to be closer to the five-year range in municipalities uh just because of various circumstances whether people retire resign or removed or otherwise thank you randy and so going back to mr griffith when he said five to ten years um that he would feel comfortable uh he selected to go ahead and give us that much time i think his final target i will tell you that under the icma's guidelines their ethical policies typically dictate that they should not take a position for less than two years or in extraordinary circumstances things happen you know a family overdose whatever um but in a general sense in the industry from from their professional informal regulations they tend to say if you're going to commit to a community you should commit to be there at least two years um as far as his verbal statement that he's willing to work there for at least five you know at least five years if you'll have them um that's in keeping with the general alignment of how long people tend to serve but again and none of that is in stone as as you've noted as a council already never answer serves as the pleasure of their accounts thank you andy thank you any other questions before i release okay i have i have one um as you know [Music] things break things happen and they're they don't follow a specific time clock which means you could get calls in the middle of the night uh from any resident who just so happens to have figured out what your own phone number is um are you prepared for that i'm used to that i've gotten long since used to uh i sleep with my cell phone and so i do get calls things do happen and uh it's always been my job to handle them you would consider that being part of your job oh yes yeah that's that's that's that's somebody has to do it and i'm the one to do it i'm happy to go through that thank you very much any other questions before i uh send them back out all right sir if you don't mind uh please uh step out again and uh this time i'm i'm calling for final comments and then mr roberts if you would wait until everyone else has the opportunity to speak so that you do get the last word all right any comments from the council yes uh addressing the whole thing about hiring a headhunter frankly you just kind of go back full circle and it would cost us an additional 20 percent just hire the same person thank you anyone else i would just like to add that i did consult with our attorney before i post the question and i was not really the question about his credit score but more of looking for an explanation which was not given okay thank you very much right baker you have any comments no comments anyone else all right boy roberts that's both eddie would you please pass out the balance um they're up there mayor yes [Applause] thank you okay before we get the results i'd like to remind everyone that this is not hiring this candidate this would move us into the negotiations phase ready council member notaro voted no councilmember roberts voted yes mayor gattis voted yes [Applause] vice mayor gunn voted yes councilmember shirley voted no council members abel voted yes and is mr is councilmember baker holding okay one more and count council member banker voted no thank you pay so that is four yes to three no which uh means we can move forward with the negotiation page um before we move forward with that i would like to have a quick discussion with the council to decide where we stand on the salary and what everyone's ideas on what would be the best mandate to negotiate mayor if i may well use what you folks discuss or ponder the salary question and it has been my experience that you may not necessarily do it this way i'm happy and prepared to negotiate with the candidate as you know based on whatever guidance you're given and work through drafts to ultimately present to you based on my guidance if that informs your the council's thinking at all i did want you since i'm not presenting to offer any body language or other indication i wanted to make sure you were aware thank you very much and as we uh we all know uh he pretty much told us what he was looking for and i think that it was something that we were we must have considered seriously considered because for people that knew what salary he was looking for and what expectations he had voted to move forward with negotiations and everyone knows what that salary was correct i would like to see that a yeah i think somebody had mentioned something previously when i apologized my voice got a little colder i did test myself twice but the nearby city recently hired a city manager and we were familiar i can't recall what that number was does anybody remember oh it was 135 so it was 135 000 in which city was okay so in nearby city on both boulevard 135 000 um and as one of the citizens stated earlier with inflation and different things going on i know at some point we were looking at a lower number however the end of the statement that we get what you pay for weighs a lot so um you're right we know that we're dealing when he's currently making 140 000 he said the bonuses are not to be taken into consideration the city does give a card car allowance right correct or allowance so that would be effectively added to whatever number you know we could back that out subtract that from 140 going with a number to say is apples to apples whatever we think from a negotiating standpoint and randy was saying what that he would actually do the negotiating before he would actually do the negotiating and i uh um mr mora um the council would still have to approve the negotiating salary correct absolutely i would never suggest that i have the ability to contract independently what i would hope to do is take whatever guidance you give me whatever the candidate's position is try and reconcile those two into a document that could be presented and say uh you know the candidate is satisfied with the terms of moralized here the council still has to approve it and you tweak it whether it's because you want to add a you know an allowance for attending a conference or you know car allowance or a tech allowance or any of those sorts of things that you find in you know what is the contribution to the retirement plan i can go by of course what i've seen in your past managers contract and whatever you know standard things that are addressed in contracts like how termination would be handled etc but i i would work towards the draft based on the input of the discussion you're having now and if there are any intangibles i would say this was you know the candidate offered this it did not seem it did not seem unreasonable or could seem an alignment it is for you to consider as a body but regardless the candidate will not be hired until this council approves an appointment and with all his sailing terms and that would be uh as soon as you had the information you would notify me and then we would call another special counsel meeting to approve the negotiated contract correct correct my hope would be to do that in the most efficient fashion so you don't have to have i doubt many of you are for one to four meetings so i would have i would like to have that uh towards final product you know for your consideration if it aligns with some other meeting schedule we can certainly put it as part of that i know you have some budget hearings come up if we align with that grade but yes and in general since it would be um a special meeting to consider in terms of the contract um and discuss that and if for some reason this council desires to workshop it as i know with uh council manager reece departure there was some discussion about a preference towards workshopping things before we vote on them while you could amend it at the council meeting that's ultimately how we proceeded is at the discretion of this body um and most most specifically the mayor in as much as the code grants use some additional powers to unilaterally call something else compared to a group decision thank you very much what i i think that's a valuable point that you would like to see if that means something something proving that uh what his current salary is um i feel very strongly that this money will come back to us the proof is in the pudding we'll know we'll know quickly my recommendation would be provided that he can give us proof of his salary my recommendation would be to move forward with 140 and uh the standard car allowance which i believe is 500 a month i believe that's what it is a second exactly what we saw in the uh that makes a lot more sense so too okay all right uh can we have it baker has his hand raised you don't see that council member yeah i'm a little bit confused uh the council just voted four to three to move on to this process and now we're already questioning his credibility by asking for a w-2 form that we don't trust them already um another thing is we talked about salary ranges at workshops for out how long two months i don't think we were ever going to exceed 110 000 i think it was clearly noted that that we had yes the taste for champagne on a beer man's budget but now uh all of a sudden we're going to be able to come up with the extra money i'm just totally confused on this thank you mr banker uh vice mayor gunner i think it's actually a russian proverb it's an and perfect lady picked up on it trust me verify it's all of our due diligence as we have seen one thing a possibility also is we gave us we we've overhauled evaluations a lot but maybe there may be some expectations you want to build in ahead during the negotiation say yeah hey we think you're worth this these are our expectations and these are the things we're going to be monitoring and engaging your performance on um i like that would you like to take the lead come over where would you like them mr mora would you say 48 hours is sufficient uh get 40 to 48 hours in terms of what i began talking about was the acute criteria that could be inserted in the employment agreement that's that's i'm not i don't expect to have anything in draft until monday as i'm going to need to talk to the candidate as well at some point tomorrow so 48 hours the difference between uh you know saturday at 10 a.m and and monday at 10 a.m is negligible to me i don't want to create an unreasonable deadline certainly not for my supervisor in the form of the commission so i have the pleasure or whatever timeline you see fit my hope would be that we would have a full draft together by in a week's time of you know one that we can met out whatever details need betting out between now and next thursday so that by friday hopefully we have a final document based on you know the time it may take the candidate to produce whatever documentation you requested my time to memorialize this is not that you'd be able to i don't think we're in a huge hurry just because he said two to four weeks but uh i smear that i would say 48 hours might be tight because what i would i would ask for is i can come up with a straw man for some of these expectations but i would certainly like to put them out there through the city clerk for all the council to look at and kind of review and maybe you can help me find twitter or add something fair enough so yeah maybe present something to randy have it to him first thing monday he said that sounds fair enough that's defined by me i i have to say this at the council just because it was a little ambiguous as your legal counsel uh when you talk about brainstorming if you're going to be brainstorming with your fellow members of the council that should be done in a public meeting but as far as seeking insight from staff including my office and our experience with other communities happy to provide that offline but as far as your other kept working with your counsel members on some substantive action that would be more of a open meeting dialogue tonight that maybe we have a meeting monday maybe we can reserve an hour before the meeting during and i was thinking right along the same lines as glenn was but i was going to say they have a 90-day performance and then quarterly sort of benchmark so we aren't waiting for a year into his you know employment to say oh okay like this or we weren't doing that right or what happened just some data on a regular basis from us and council i just want to remind you before we get very hyper technical and and this may be a little premature to state but as you talk about having benchmarks and the like because the miniature does serve it to your pleasure you need not resettle arbitrary points in time to make decisions if someone did not performing to your satisfaction of course you can always give feedback and you can always terminate i just want to make sure you're clear about it and i'm i'm a little leery as you talk about setting up trip wires for you even more you know red lines that they've been described in the national politics where he crosses a certain line it's just sort of your your decision is made for you so as you as you do work through that it may be more to develop regular check-ins and sessions as opposed to meet this benchmark or else but something to consider in terms of an employment room thank you very much admit this is just curiosity but i would like to see copies of our former city managers contracts patty to you is that something that are in the files somewhere yes okay uh if you would just please email a copy of everyone on the house thank you any other comments randy we had an opportunity to see um the previous city manager's contract i did see it i worked through it for purposes of the separation okay was it um in your opinion was it a normal city managing contract uh generally speaking it was a normal contract in terms of the provided for compensation separation term innovation and benefits and that's really what we're going to be looking for as far as the it's hard to say what's normal in terms of compensation because that varies widely by community means community expectations in some communities they provide for you know a tech budget attendance at an icma conference uh and other things in some communities are here's your salary here's your retirement here's your health insurance don't ask for anything else so in the sense that it has the essential elements yes what those elements are i i will shine away from saying what is standard in compensation measures okay would it be unusual in the example i know um mary gaddis mentioned the number 140 the fact that if we offered the um 250 a month car allowance which equates to 3 000 a year would it make sense it would be fair to offer uh 100 if the number is 140 to offer 136 plus the 3 000 a year car allowance would most people think that that's the same i wouldn't speak to what's reasonable and fair if those are sort of intangibles and my job is to respond for you and not deal in too many adjectives what i would say is that that is a reasonable negotiation position and it's not uncommon to take salary and negotiate in that fashion for total compensation and say we can't get you to number x but we can provide this just as in uh in the litigation sphere sometimes when we're five thousand dollars apart that'll say okay i can't come to your number but what if i just paid a mediator and you don't have to pay your share today and somebody says okay well then that gets me there because i was going to come out of the same clock so whether or not that persuades the candidate is an entirely different calculus if that's a hard number for them and they're not looking at full compensation it may be reasonable it may be fair in the estimation of some but it may not hit you again and speak and that's why we want to go through the negotiation process and i would and and why i'm listening intently to this discussion to see to the extent there's any flexibility in that discussion from the council's direction where it is and what it is and what what if you're not willing to go to certain numbers what are you willing to do or what do you consider you know are you considering at this stage of course you haven't seen it but whatever the retirement contribution was made for your last manager i know your last manager did not receive health insurance through the city but instead received a i believe it was six hundred dollars a month stipend to secure his own um that was one term if you're seeking to move in that direction does that change the calculus for the candidate i don't know so those are the sort of things we're going to have to look at in the negotiations process to say i don't know what all of his assets are and in getting those that may inform what some of your responses are and that's why it is a negotiations process and why tonight we're just deciding that we want it you have to decide to move towards that discussion or dance as opposed to finale okay so uh what i would recommend then is we do the work session as a councilmember shirley suggested and we pick up this conversation monday at 5 00 pm in a special council meeting and that will happen before the regular council meeting is that is that fair enough okay great mr mora uh do you have a problem uh appearing here at 5 pm instead of 6. i will you checking my calendar i do not okay great all right all right well i think that that ends this conversation i would like to bring i would like to bring mr griffin back in i think he heard me this time no he did not hello again mr griffin [Music] all right welcome back uh the council has uh has voted to move forward with negotiations so congratulations on making it through this uh this next phase on monday the council will meet in a special council meeting to set some parameters with the city attorney more and he will be contacting you after that date to begin negotiations and see if we can reach an agreement does that work for you yes sir it sounds fun okay great i would like to thank you very much for making your way out uh tonight and [Music] being good free will we put you through i don't think it was too bad was it no it was not i enjoyed it that's great we're all very sharp very congenial thank you thank you very much um well with that being said uh i think that this will conclude this meeting uh would anyone like to make a motion to return ocean return all right motion made by frank baker thank you second by leslie nataro all in favor aye aye this uh this meeting is a turn good night everyone"
