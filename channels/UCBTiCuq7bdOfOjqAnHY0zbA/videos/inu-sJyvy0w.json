    "transcript": "good evening everyone welcome to the monday night good morning good afternoon everyone uh welcome to the monday november 1st city council meeting for the city of baylor beach florida um we now normally do the pledge of allegiance but before we do the pledge of allegiance today our city does not have a special service on veterans day which is november 11th and i always like to honor the brave men and women who have served our country veterans day is your day it's the day that we show some appreciation for the sacrifice that you made in serving this country so i'm going to ask if you are a veteran if you would please stand up uh stay standing and here's what i want to do normally i lead the pledge of allegiance government's nice and loud and proud you can lead that pledge of allegiance for us all veterans of our city families all people in this country thank you thank you from this city thank you for me thank you for all of us it's not said enough we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing if you didn't do what you did so thanks again all right hey um i'm adam clerk if you would please don't call council member leslie ontario here council member rita so here vice mayor dave gavis here mayor joseph mandela city manager lynn reeves here city attorney fred o'reilly here and council member ramon ockey hasn't arrived yet okay and let the record reflect that one gun is on a telephone hookup we have five people present so we have a quorum and we will proceed uh first item of business is the approval of the agenda i'll entertain motion right motioned by frank bancard second second leslie dave gaddis uh either and any discussion no discussion by the council any discussion by the citizens council take a voice vote all in favor of improving the agenda i anyone opposed passes five six to zero uh item two is the citizens comments the way we do citizens comments if you're new here on any item that is not on the agenda okay so if you see it listed on the agenda there's going to come a time where i'm going to ask for citizen comments like i just did on the agenda right um so there'll be a time when you can come up and speak about an agenda item but if you don't see it here if there's something else that's on your mind you know somebody i don't know you know put a hole in your street and you want to let the city manager know come over and talk with us the way we're going to do it is you come right up over here by the podium uh please announce yourself give us your name and address and um you have three minutes of time if you need up to 12 minutes you have to get that from other people they need to give that to you beforehand we ask that we speak um with decorum and with a politeness to everyone here and i think it should work out real well with that said is there anyone who would like to address the counseling yes sir gentlemen here hi uh brag lover 126 9th street um so two things one i wanted to see if we have an update i know these are comments and i don't know if you guys can interact but you know 9th street here which i live has been continually been flooded and it seems to be up here it's three years in a row now and still nothing gets done and it's a high tide it still floods um it's really a drainage issue from like 128 to 124 and so just trying to understand that there's any type of room in the budget for basic amazing infrastructure it'll be awesome and then number two i want to see if there's any update or anything around beach umbrellas on the beach i've got two young kids it really makes it a quality of life issue for us here in miller beach not being able to have safety for my kids from a sun point of view i know you guys have talked about a lot but at the same time you know we haven't really received a lot of updates on it from our perspective and we're getting a little frustrated around that so maybe just two comments questions but it is really affecting quality of life thank you so here's another like i'd like to do um with the council that's present normally mr glover we we're not supposed to have an interaction directed direction you have that part right um but i hate to say to you i will absolutely address your feature pros like i'm the man on that that's my lawsuit i'll tell you all about it but um the other thing is the city manager and i think you're gonna like what you have what he has to tell you i'd rather do that now than have you wait till the end of the night and stuff but in order to do that i need these council to tell us that it's okay to dispense with the rules that we have this interaction so with that said does anybody have a problem if we dispense the rules and answer these questions for him now do you have a question yeah motion is spencer motion sure secretary of goddess any comments citizen suffocating comments bring it to a vote voice vote all in favor of dispensing with the rules so that we can answer the citizens tonight all right anyone opposed how's the 6-0 let's give you your answers um first of ninth street let's take care of that first i'm going to be furthest to the city manager he's our expert on lynn reeves yes uh that 9th street is in a rotation of projects this year it's 12th and 13th and 17th and 18th and i think i don't have it in front of me but if you want to call just call city hall ask for me i'll give you the year when it's done there is a check valve on night street and uh so there shouldn't be high tide water coming up but when it rains there is water because the pipes are full and so it's on the list of projects and i can tell you at high tide definitely does that answer that question i'm going to answer your question about this issue it's not a city issue if the city does it actually it's the citizens who hold the rights to use 6th street 12th street 19th street beach accesses that's why it's the citizens that have taken the step which is my lawsuit but they're just 43 people have joined me so an update everyone in the city i'm glad you asked this because there's no other way i would have been able to say this okay the beach umbrella band is in full force you may have gotten away with putting it up until this time and the reason why you got away with it is because the sheriffs were unable to write you a ticket at the last council leading commission meeting of the bel air shore commissioners they passed a very heavy fine schedule the first umbrella violation cost you 100 your second one cost you two hundred fifty dollars your third one and thereafter for the next five years will cost you five hundred dollars a pop if you decide to challenge it with their magistrate i know you're shaking urine and i shook my head five hundred 500 upwards of a fine for your first violation so it could be a very expensive afternoon at the beach that is in play right now they passed that last time i think the 29th was the 10-day waiting period so if you go out there and put one up you might get lucky and the sheriff gives you a warning you might not i can tell you they get they get to keep the revenue from this they get to keep pretty much all the revenue and they're looking forward to making that revenue in terms of the lawsuit i'm not going to tell you anything that's not public okay the initial motions to dismiss failed i wonder they i defended them successfully we're now we finished the paper discovery we're now going to start with the depositions that will and the rest of the discovery which should end by the end of february and once that ends then the lawyers will do the lawyer stuff because there's a bunch of issues that are constitutional issues which are fairly complex that are going to be briefed and possibly depending on how the agreement between the two parties goes may be able to be actually tried before the trial it's scheduled for trial next july that's as fast as justice works okay it's almost two years that we've had today i am going nowhere i'm going to continue this um there's still time if anybody wants to intervene you'd be an intervener if you want to do that it's a lady here should wear a red shirt her name is deborah mall see her okay do not come to me [Music] [Music] his three-year-old granddaughter was thrown into the hot sun right so i was two weeks ago a neighbor okay doctor mike was talking to me about the beaches and he has an autistic grandchild that no longer can read you each okay because he cannot stay in the sun for 30 minutes now i don't know why this council doesn't grasp all this you know up here and i just can't get enough support i appreciate it thank you guys so much thanks for letting me know no problem [Music] [Music] what is your excuse for not working position i will tell you this came up and i believe and i could be wrong on this because i'm going straight off recollection recollection um but the robonaki made a motion i don't even know that it got a second i can't participate in it obviously since it's my lawsuit any citizen any citizen could have brought that lawsuit and by the way to dispel any misinformation there's been more than a sheriff that put out okay how do you go directly to a lawsuit they were we went across the street on july 21st 2020 in an attempt to resolve that the city manager came glenn gunn came uh we might say went across we went on zoom myself and jody shirley we each spoke on different things we didn't speak on behalf of the city when reeves did speak on behalf of the city they rejected us okay after i was told by mayor schmidt who i called earlier to get a moratorium on the thing he said give me a chance to work on it and then ultimately they said now we're just going to leave it in place one of their commissioners and i had to take in my legal files and it's public information for them actually said i'll listen to bel air beach but i'm not changing my mind okay he had no intention of changing his mind that there was this misinformation that oh we were close to a settlement there was no settlement because i gave them two weeks or two of notice of events notice before the lawsuit but i didn't go right to law soon i gave him two weeks that deadline would have been i think august 14th or so i might be off by a day or two i didn't bring the lawsuit to september 28th they had a month and a half to reach out to me not one person picked up the phone that one person picked up an email and one person contacted the city and said voted wait a minute mr manzo hold off okay and then i finally pulled the trigger and said i'm going to go for a lawsuit and that's what's going to get these rights back and i'm going to win this okay my question is that's not on behalf of all this issues i'm asking you as a mayor why isn't the city council i have to recuse myself so ask the city council so i so city council i am pleading with council to do something now all right i i asked to go to court for a temporary court injunction could get nowhere with that as you said okay because it affects everyone that lives well everyone has a dollar amount and we just can't get the support but we can't get four votes here um yeah look again i i commend the mayor for doing this right i'm not going to intervene with the lawsuit because i don't want to before i was if you look at the tapes back in i believe july 2020 this entire council was on board before they went to the belarus shores meeting to do something the mayor clearly says and if i say something wrong correct and mayor clearly says we want to give them a short notice what we want okay i'm not paraphrasing the right any other council members not sure i'll address that may i say something first yes the and i'm just we'll say it directly as i can the city council has a code provision that says the council cannot discuss prospective or pending litigation [Music] the rules that they have to abide by so the status of the the case is that the city did not ish uh was not a party to the lawsuit the city has not been brought into the lawsuit and private citizens initiated the lawsuit and private citizens are involved in the litigation process and up until now the city council has not taken any action to become involved in the lawsuit and the lawsuit is taking its course so that that's the status i would caution the city council on discussing prospective litigation because that's the rule so that that's my uh statement to the city council and giving them legal advice [Music] it's not my opinion it's what the city code states so they can't discuss pending litigations no they know what is [Music] they cannot discuss pending litigation that involves a city they cannot discuss according to the rules that exist now perspective litigation i didn't make up the rule i'm only telling you what it is i don't necessarily disagree with you but i'm i'm telling you what what the city code says yes certainly all right wait hang on mr handsome i want to have a quick can we speak yes please speak into my countdown no appreciate it no no i understand thank you captain say well i'm going to address you because it's my lawsuit and i'll talk about it all i want okay and first off it's not prospective litigation the city's never been threatened with coming into this lawsuit and we were not counter-claimed by the city of the town of neller shore okay so it's my private lawsuit and [Music] anyone can join it subordinate to me as an intervener i can object to people coming in i'm not objected to a single person i will object if you're not sharing my views which is we want our umbrellas back but that that is long more than umbrella ordinance that i'm fighting i'm fighting for their abuse of the parking lots if you go there frank bancord is a witness to this one uh a 100 ton construction crane was parked there they've used their parking lots as if they're their own personal parking lots i'm fighting that and i'll tell you what okay they don't they own those lots but they own them with a sole purpose and the sole purpose is to keep them for the bellaire beach citizens living east of the center line of gulf boulevar boulevard and it is for our beach and bathing purposes they are entitled to no other use that's my interpretation and about six other attorneys and i'll tell you what they use them as if it's theirs and i'm out to change that we're gonna quiet that title and what we're gonna do because they've abused their trusteeship i'm not telling you anything that's not in the lawsuit and i'll be happy to send you a copy of it okay that's public record and i will send you that my law my my file somebody's going to ask here if they can have my litigation file and no you can't but the lawsuit itself is a public record of betler shore and i'll be more than happy to give you that um and it's also you can get it on the city but quite the time i don't understand that quiet the title means to figure out who owns this and who can do what with it it says that we have the right to have beach and bathing purposes and my interpretation is very simple i go to every beach in the country every beach in the world and i've never found anyone in the band's shade it's a health issue it's just ridiculous okay you need to have a reasonable basis to have a wall that's the lowest level of scrutiny my take on this is that it's unconstitutional because in florida we have what's known as a right of privacy and you're saying well privacy on a beach you couldn't be more public the right of privacy is your medical privacy you have the right to make all medical determinations yourself under the florida constitution i'll decide if i want to expose my skin to the sun and this is the only time i could ever in my life ever think of the city taking away a protective device the city makes you wear masks the city makes or the state wears you make seat belts and helmet laws and everything else for protection okay and they're taking away umbrellas that can stop skin cancer that can stop heat stroke there's this is unprecedented and it's more than that because they opened up the bottle when they decided to tangle with me okay point of order point of order he's well over his three minutes for citizen's comments and discussing the lawsuit is not the city is not a part of it it has nothing to do yes for an update on it and i'm going to rule that out he's not he's getting an explanation from me and i'm giving it to him i'm not bound by a time limit so i'll continue okay the lawsuit also has bicycles on the beach down along that wet sand which is creating money you can ride a bicycle and if god bless you you can ride it in the dry sand okay right but down there there's something called florida public trust doctrine that means that belongs to all the citizens and actually all all the people okay anyone can go and use that wet sand for recreation purposes and you can't mount a bicycle in their city and we're going to come to later tonight and put a ban on electric bicycles i don't want to ride away bicycles but a pedaled bicycle you know good old-fashioned foot power bicycle why not that's recreation and on top of that why do i have to fast while i'm on the beach that's another thing that's unconstitutional so i'm attacking all of it when i get done i take away their trusty because they hold it as trustee when they get done there's gonna be another group hopefully there that runs those spots and they run them properly that's what i'm shooting for all right thank you okay thank you and by the way captain i know your captain in the navy thank you it's okay i appreciate the service so thank you for coming up did jonathan your hand up by the other citizens yes come on john hansen 103 22nd street i was unable to attend the work session but i listened to the tapes and i heard something in there very disturbing as a citizen attendant a taxpayer and one who has taken an oath multiple times in my life and it was related to um the quote basically being well this is why we have liability insurance and it went to passing rules or circumventing or disregarding established law rules ordinances whatever for the information of the citizens our liability bond over insurance is only 1 million dollars so hypothetically somebody on the council or the council did something wrong and a citizen the citizens sued for two and a half million and one who do you think is responsible for the other million and a half we are that's not what we elected people to do is to circumvent or ignore the oath of office and i take serious offense with that yes i will listen to the audio tapes don't look at me section 9.02 is the oath of office for this city basically it says you score a note of the defending constitution the united states the state of florida and all laws and ordinances you don't flagrantly disregard the law because you don't like it i'm saying [Music] if you can't consciously do the job that you sworn over to you don't belong up there [Music] thank you thank you mr hansigan thank you for the service to uh greg make sure i get it right command master chief of the name in the navy right and the navy thank you go meet captain zable back there maybe you guys said anyone else yes sir hello yes you're here don't move 26 motivation uh this bill you just cut out you were doing good so i maybe you gotta get real super close to it did you hit the button maybe is it green hello there you go okay uh billboard 2611 bayshore unfortunately this isn't my first time complaining about this but i've had discussions with lynn the house next door to me has had a dumpster in his front yard for five months and the last three months no one has worked on my house and i'm sick of it i mean i pay we they all pay a lot of taxes and there's a dumpster in our neighborhood right next to my house and no one can figure out how to get rid of it mr booth you pick the right night this is the first time that we've had our code officer and our invitation come here i know that so we're going to ask him about your situation and find out what's the situation i mean the house has been vacant for two years i believe the owner of the actual owner of the house has died it's in court you know the person taking care of the places in california and could care less what the place looks like the dock is falling into the into the into the water and i have to look at this every day and everyone that goes up goes up my street looks at it every day and yet a neighbor of mine is was redoing the house and he got cut a coat violation for trying to improve his house in a matter of two days and this thing has been there for four months and i'm tired of people complaining without identifying themselves no booth 2611 bay shore and i have a complaint i'd like to see the other person that they complained about my neighbor trying to do better on his house and make the neighborhood nice and and have asked why it's ridiculous yeah second thing is where are our police in the morning on on bel air cause on the beller bridge it says 35 miles an hour today i walk the bridge every day please say hello to me or beat when you walk drive by at 60 miles an hour uh i watched a car pass two cars today and nothing the police aren't around we could make a ton of money we could have enough money to do more lawsuits if they just tagged people for driving crazy on that road so that's it okay mr hang hang on a second here um let me give you a piece of information i'm gonna ask the police because they're coming up next okay once we finish the citizen comments and i'm gonna ask [Music] no no i'm asking you to share i have two sheriff's office one sheriff's officer will give us our report on the regular crime sheriff i'd like you to address the speeding issue and uh and danny doherty our code enforcement deputy um he will talk about the enforcement of the dumpster issue let me give you one piece of information with regarding to these anonymous complaints that used to be a problem in fact it was a problem statewide because citizens used it sometimes to get even with people and like you say you know you've got a good guy and he's getting busted you thank the governor and the legislature on this one they passed an ordinance that took a law that took effect and now all code complaints need to be identified so there is no more anonymity who was that guy who was the person that turned into that would be ones that started after they passed the law so that's it's a recent thing i believe it yeah july so i'd like i'd like to know that gentleman's name and turn jeff in actually it was before july 1st what it was before july 1st so guys any other citizens deborah of two concerns uh last meeting we spoke at length you guys spoke at length about ukraine on the 12th street access yet and and to mr hansik's uh comments about the interns i'm totally in agreement with you on that excuse me miss vault let me interrupt you patty hold the timer robinakis arrived at 6 29 okay please continue but um when this sign was installed out front i have pictures i have video no one was there supervising it number one number two there there were only cones immediately behind the truck not blocking the sidewalk so all the people they started in summer because i'm up running and um the um there was no blockage of the sidewalk no blockage coming into the parking lot or anything and we had just talked about the danger and they had a big crane to put that thing in so to me that's negligence and i believe that we should be supervising things a little better with those things my other comment is i noticed on the agenda that we are going to um uh give a certificate or something for the mats for the handicap to access the beach and i'm all for that believe me but um i also believe that maybe the city could do something for the beach accesses because um autism cancer those are all disabilities as well so we have those types of disabilities or autoimmune disorders or whatever need protection at the beach as well not only access to a protection of it and we have just as much right to access the beach at these street accesses as we do in our city thank you thank you um before you go uh let me see if the city manager wishes to comment with regards to the sign installed since you're here do you want to speak on this well there was i was out there i was out there maybe not when you took your pictures there were cones around the truck the side front and back it was not blocking any sidewalk and this sign was put in and uh kyle and i were out there i know two or three times okay i i i got a camera on my house shoots it all but anyway the cones were very close to the truck there was nothing blocking off that sidewalk it didn't need to be because the truck wasn't blocking the sidewalk no not for the truck what if something had fallen the crane wasn't operating towards the sidewalk it was operating [Music] i did contact the city manager about a complaint or two about it um and i was leaving town for the day but the day before there what got me upset was they were welding out there with no shield around and if you ever get welder's eye let me ask you this you you have video you don't have to it's certainly not any requirement are you able to share any of that with us and send them to us at any point you can send it to any one of us or you could send it to all of us or you could send it to a generation and distribute it to everyone that would become a public record and then we can see what you saw and that would be great and then we can deal with this again anyone else jim vansgoey [Applause] jim van school is 7th street pilot beach as far as the crane i had to come in here to get a book out of the mailbox and there was no spotter out there the cones were just be in place and they weren't being placed right next to the unit i actually caught i had pictures as well okay there was no spotter there was no one supervising there was god looking up the crane there was not a second party i witnessed it all pulling into this parking lot to get that boat and coming back out and quite frankly i was pretty intimidated having a crane up in the air and i have a convertible so i was very intimidated about that with no backup security system i'm not saying they weren't here at some point in time i did not witness that and i was not watching it all day long so i can't speak to that the other thing this city passed a resolution i believe that they were not involved in the umbrella lawsuit against bel-air short okay so for the gentleman that was questioning that the city said they passed a resolution now there were some council members that voted against it obviously and then of course the mayor had to abstain from the vote on it because of this lawsuit that's the other thing third thing i want to make sure that i personally witnessed the parkour putting on one heck of an event this weekend and i personally think they did a fantastic job and i i saw so many children from this city participate and it was very heartwarming and i think this city needs to readdress the fact that we do have children and we need to be their voice as community as a community and start putting more money into this park out here for our children to enjoy we want to be a premier city we want to retain our citizens who know your neighbors you know we need to step up our game and do things to make it desirable to make them want to stain stay in our city we have neighbors that have been here grew up here and are still here and they're raising the next generation and i think that this is something that this city needs to address thank you thank you any other citizens like to speak [Music] saying no other hands i'm going to close citizen comments next we have the presentation of pinellas county sheriff's office i'm going to ask that the patrol sheriff make first presentation and then code officer or code officer you're going to go second and if you just introduce us yourself so everyone knows who you are corporal killman from moscow sheriff's office these are the staff for september 2021 there were 821 events in the city uh 200 and 500 traffic stops there were nine suspicious persons nine floating new vessel stops six uh performance violations which resulted in seven arrests sheriff i note that one of the things is a motor vehicle theft and every this is available to all citizens if you sign up in the county there's a you get a blast from the sheriff tell you on real time this is september but this is telling us what happened you know like last week and everything it comes every week thank god most of the times it says nothing from our beach i noticed that there was some another motor vehicle uh in our city it just happened i guess last week is that is that you know anything about that one and that would show up to the next one but um there was another it looked like there was another motor vehicle theft would be having a group of people maybe going around i just want to alert the citizens you'd like to tell everyone make sure you your car doors do not break actually into the car so they just walk around trying partners and you can get your wallets your keys at the car will be completely fine and your handguns too we've had issues with that too okay um councilman questions uh great job as usual just you know make sure we pass on the word here that you know keep things locked up and uh you know because we know that's an epidemic they just go around there's doors called lifting i think and you know if you happen to have it unlocked they lift all the stuff inside too that's not good and the bad thing is unfortunately some people leave firearms and that's great to have firearm protection 100 second amendment but don't leave it unlocked in a car i think we had sheriff's deputy killed a couple years ago because of that so yeah lean by billy yeah hang on for one second let's get any questions from the council citizens yes uh mr booth so mr boosa the question regarding the um well patrols on the bridge is the main question right now correct like i said out of 200 821 uh events in the city 205 which led the max uh were the next instance in the city so unfortunately it only resulted in 32 capsules taken citations but i just asked uh deputy dougherty to enable a direct patrol for the bridge in the morning particular time we're going to have it more because it's 6 am i walk from 7 30 to 9 o'clock and it's unbelievable all right i'm gonna make it from six to eight you know i see you at 4 45 every morning we've got about two or three cars not only there about the golf as well you guys are out there correct uh i don't know our shift we sit at the give me a radar here's the other thing we can do and we're not going to disclose the date but liberties knows exactly you can tell me what i'm going to say right now rightly okay so we started something um not too long ago where we had special patrols it was because i was noticing a lot of speeders on the boulevard we were getting complaints on 22nd street people were coming racing doing stuff so we had undercover officers we paid for this separately but we've got some money set aside for this okay it's been a long time since we've done that okay and we usually try and keep it till we get to the height of the tourist season and everything but we're hearing we have a citizen who's observed it he's out every day on the bridge okay um and i'll tell you a call i got one time okay i got a call from a citizen the first time we did it and it's great because i'm not going to tell you how we do it but you'll never know it until you're pulled over okay and he goes you know that's really sneaky of you guys you had a you know you caught me coming off the bridge and i was doing like 55 and i'm like i'm sorry what were you doing 55 it's a 35. you know i like going fast too but that's the wrong place to be going fast because you come right into a residential neighborhood so um we're not going to have that so when how about it you know what i'm talking about okay yeah good i've seen a couple high-speed car chases up and down gulf boulevard too there was a couple nights the sheriff was in hot pursuit in a few cases so it's it's wild out there you know so keep it up you guys are doing a wonderful job we appreciate it very very much this ladies gentleman is danny doherty has been our code enforcement officer now for about a year and a half or so yes we've asked that he come here and give a annual a monthly report uh so that he can hear from the council with any questions that we have and also hear from the citizens so the way we're going to do this i know we've had some people speak from the seats i really can't have that so if we're going to have anybody wants to speak we'll have the sheriff well we call call for citizen comments sheriff will step aside you can speak into the bike this way it gets captured on the mic he'll go first we'll ask the questions and then i'll open it up for city uh citizen questions and comments dan deputy daugherty i'm making you a corporal whether you like it or not because we have a carvel behind it ten years ago good evening everyone first of all apologize for my parents i'm covered in cement dust from earlier today so i apologize before i address my uh the code sheet and the stats that um code related i can answer some of your questions the traffic enforcement all of our deputies included the builder beach deputy during the school hours are assigned to monitor the school stop on gulf boulevard and elsewhere one of those resulted in one of those double car arrests the vehicle spent basically blew the red light on the red sign on the bus deputy ali extinguished on day shift early in the morning made a traffic stop right from baylor beach they were occupied by three subjects the car was reported stolen out of county and everybody went to jail so that's one of them one example i interrupt you for one second do you know how that report of that came in about the school buses being run i'm presuming uh a lady right in the middle there just vancouver when captain weiner was here they were talking about code enforcement she came up and she she was up i don't it wasn't me i was sleeping but like 5 30 6 o'clock in the morning when the kids get on the bus she heard it a couple of times with horns beeping that's what they'll do when they run it and she goes i've heard it two or three times and captain lioner made a note of it and obviously got it out to the deputies and that resulted in a nice rest so thank you citizens and we do listen and so to our sheriffs so please continue and uh before i go further i'm going to address mr truth's complaint about the 2601 bay shore about the green dumpster senior manager and i have had communication and we're definitely working on it um one thing i did and i apologize to uh to lynn uh late friday or friday right before i get off work and over the weekend i received a phone call from the contra apparently a new contractor i'm not sure you've got that information but i wanted to get with it today before i came today we just got busy um this uh this contractor i've got his information he's dealing with the sister apparently the one that's controlling the property that lives out of state he's very motivated to get everything done uh he's gonna be working on the permitting process coming in and dealing with these otherwise um i i became involved on october 6th when uh there was a dumpster without a cover on it which is awarded this violation but the courtesy notice to no avail because nobody's there somehow he got the information uh that there was a violation notice on the door uh vacant house he in a timely manner put the cover on the dumpster and he's working on trying to get his house back into shape so we should see some progress on that and update on that okay i'll get with you about that contract information so you can expect them coming in hopefully in the very near future so okay i just noticed that uh on my activity sheet that you have and i apologize um last pages the dates are locked [Music] yeah no it's limited it looks like you don't have a wide enough column so that yeah but through the month of october we started our 20 hours a week from eight hours a week and uh i can break it down we basically we had a 101 um new violations 57 of those were corrected that day what i do from that point on i follow up by communicating with the citizens out of those 101 out of the remaining ones um i resolved 55 um during that month there were 55 clothes that i did follow-ups on 41 of those uh resulted in closure so it's a constant i've got open cases and communicating with citizens and trying to get the result as quickly as i can out of those 101 i broke down in the columns you say yes c the letter c that means to this complaint and there were a total of six new citizen planes during october but a lot of those c's in that column are in the categories of follow-ups so even though it's a follow-up it says a basic plane just for your information so you can see that a little better in this version because i know that's concerning too to everyone but how many citizen complaints are compared to proactive enforcement and then to break down there's a lot of there's a lot of information in this spreadsheet which can be broken down in various ways but during the month of october uh the four major categories of activity uh consists of the most were permit checks which i initiate myself when i see work being done in a house i'll make sure that there's a permit posted on the property and it's they're working doing what they should be doing according to them 16 of those residents had proper permits i had to do follow-ups on three of them where they had to go get a copy of the permit or they're still the process which they did two of the three comply there's ones that allow standing where for whatever reason it's just not just one property which i'm dealing with but that's uh that's my that's probably my most significant activity compared to everything else the next significant is landscaping issues and total 14 of those they're landscaping related i can break them down into like seven different categories the most are basically and weeds exceeding seven inches of height and i'm pretty successful in getting closure on that out of those out of those or just five of the month and i required like nine different follow-ups to get people compliantly dead the and in that category landscaping uh it breaks down into things one was visibility you come out to go boulevard you can't see the upcoming bicycles or runners because the push is too too thick and uh within a couple of days the gentlemen cut it looks pretty good so other ones are overgrown hedges um there were two cases where there were hazardous trees that people complained about dead trees they were afraid of the trees falling on their houses and it took a little time for this is you know bigger projects for the property owner to uh to require the landscaping to get those down but they need to comply or to cure and the next item of significance would be uh parking on grass or landscape a lot of residents will park on their grass or shell up lanes go rock landscaping and a lot of them don't don't realize it's a violation and i'll communicate with them and uh there's a repeat violation we'll will one of them actually uh receive a citation because i think it might be the third time of the year one and we went through citation but primarily i mean the majority of people comply and they they understand the ordinance and then finally the most significant thing would be um dumpsters without covers on it um again that one prompted me to go to shore [Music] that's pretty much it yeah a few questions for you and corporal if this is yours or well maybe it's both of yours just jump in okay um you know our city's concerned about parking on the grass but you know cars off the street and i don't want cars to park on the grass that's against our code it's unsightly it's terrible our city doesn't go for that we've got a much greater problem and i don't see regular enforcement we have landscape vehicles and delivery trucks that routinely park in the turn lane on gulf boulevard we have been given excuses like our trailer's too big and we can't pull it into the gigantic oceanfront estate across the beach across the street i'm sorry maybe you should bring a smaller trailer okay someone's going to get killed we have personally experienced trying to make the turn onto our street trying to get into the turn lane and you've got this gigantic landscaping trailer before you can't make the turn anymore and if you do make the turn you're going blind i don't know whether it comes in as code or regular police and it's not just our city i remember seeing newspaper articles in the v that you know this is in readington this is it's all up and down gulf boulevard and you know these are not small places across the street i understand it's a quick delivery but you know when you're going those turn lanes are there for a reason you're not supposed to park and block a traffic light that's a major fine and what are we doing about it before someone gets killed and i know exactly what we're talking about um i can address that with our command staff reference enforcement and and i work different speech communities as well and i communicate with like my fellow deputies are doing the same and there's always delivery drivers that's that's doing that all the way up through entire beach communities and then i know you're talking about with the landscapers where they're claiming you know they can't look anywhere else and they're blocking driveways or whatever this is kind of they think it's the lesser of the evils so we can look further into that and um well i think that's that's what the city wants us to do well i mean i i can't we don't the council doesn't direct you the city manager wherever's throwing this information out there but it's not the first time we've called i know other people have called on it the excuses that you usually get from the landscapers that are delivering people lane you know we can't get in the gate but then you don't get your lawn cut okay these are gigantic driveways i could put my driveway twice into their driveway i can pull a trailer in there and i don't drive one regularly it's not hard then they sometimes say well we'll just park in bellaire beach no you won't do that okay the landscapers who work in better making the park at ballarat beach camp park and better make you work walk across the street that's inappropriate okay um that's that the other question i have for you deputy is in terms of what this you may need from this council any issues that you're having is there anything that you need from this council any problems that you're experiencing that the council needs to help you with i should control the price of gas you need to go to washington at some point i'll ask you how that 20 is whether it's too much too little or just right but i think it's too early probably at this point to tell i would guess right i mean i do note that there's a lot more code issues over here that have been found with more time which makes sense any questions on council hi everyone um obviously we have a new additional turn lane um going from golf on to causeway i've had two residents reach out to me and say it's not going to work um so i did an experiment the other day i hopped in the inside or the middle lane and and made a left turn to where i would have to merge there is not enough room i was i was going to wait and bring this up during your uh your time but there is not enough room to make that left turn and i'm wondering if you've noticed the same thing that it's just you have to turn so sharp to make that left if you're in the left lane you naturally drift right into the merged lane i almost got clobbered i know it's going to happen do you think that that was the best fix i i thought the i thought the uh just as long as the other motorists were being courteous and they let you know you need to be let in but you know that's not always the case on our perspective i was wondering who was that is that d.o.t that just did that on their own manager was in contact with them right they didn't do that they studied it but we approached them right yeah we got the intersection report and city council got it and the county did that course and part of their plan one of one of the things with the intersection report was to take that uh island out in the trees and we're just kind of pulled to look at that further and then there's some flashing light issues with you know it stays red now i've got a call into the county about that so okay it looks to me like either you where the thick line is where where you tell the cars to stop at it it probably needs to be moved back towards the island i think that that might help help the problem there's just not enough there's not enough room to make that left turn without crossing over into the adjacent lane i was open-minded you know i understand the reasons why they did that and then i'm on the fence like you to see if it's actually effective or non-numbers every time i take a turn i try adults just to see what it's like and what the of course uh if it's hairy when you get a congested traffic making that turn so yeah yeah okay i was i was just a little that's what i want to hear thank you any other questions citizens do you have any questions for our code officer or our deputy i'm sorry our court will yes kelly please come up and then we'll just ask the sheriffs just to step aside briefly and then they'll answer the question i'm mike kelly 27 40 hibiscus drive west i have a question if deputy dora you said that you do check for permits to make sure there's construction permits from the county for these jobs that you see under construction do you ever interact with the actual subcontractors on the job today i'm going to have the answer in the microsoft the reason i'm asking that is i'm vice chairman of the pinellas county construction licensing board we have a full staff of investigators that go around and just check with contractors that are out on the streets parked doing work at various locations all over the county if they're found not to have licenses if they're found not to have a number of license numbers on their vehicles first finds 500 if they don't have a license and they don't have uh numbers on their cards it's a thousand dollars our investigators have spread today with the sheriff for an awfully long time and we thought we'd give it to you a hundred percent and i don't know if you are interacting at all with my investigators on the licensing thank you mr kelly david dougherty thanks kelly actually um we want to get your contact information too i would love to interact i have not yet specifically interact with the investigators but i'm constantly interacting with the contractors and subcon countries i did one today uh they were carrying a driveway out along the side of the big there's a big trailer the guys sawing the the driveway through rebar is it's a total mess but of course i'm going to stop out and check with them and the contractor was uh had just left and he mistakenly had the permit with him in his possession of the truck uh my advice been had to be posted on the property so he's gonna have it posted tomorrow he just knows he will get that information and verify that he did actually have a correct permit so i'm constantly doing that but the more resources i have the community i will needs exchange information the purpose of our board is to find unlicensed contractors an awful lot of contractors because labor is very difficult to find are using unlicensed contractors if those guys know that in bellaire beach they're being checked to find out if you guys are watching them and then our investigators i will start sending them to bel air beach and we're going to find that the contractors themselves will not go using unlicensed contractors and those guys will be fined immediately on site i didn't know if you ever have the authority to say you better make sure you're licensed okay great thank you thank you i've actually sat through some of those hearings quite present any other questions by citizens thank you both thanks county sheriff's office does a fundraiser i'm not trying to it's a punishment i trust that's not me but uh this is incredible events called right around the stars um it's a it's an event out of full desoto the first saturday of every december and it basically raises money for victims children victims of children victims of crimes crimes extremely needy um uh kids that we'll never have at christmas so our deputies go and shop for them um several weeks before christmas and we deliver to the parents they give us a list and so forth um one other way is if if someone would be declined other than just donating money they can actually adopt a family um they work with our staff in our victim advocate division and where they have more personal involvement with with assisting the family and they're able to do so um what i'll do um you can always contact me but i've got a contact over here i'll leave there's a table back there's a presentation table and if we have a few that we can leave at the front uh counter for the city hall absolutely the event itself um it's basically a bicycle walking running family walks but you don't have to be an athlete to do it um it's it's fully catered uh down the floor um the helicopter flies into santa claus and brings up toys while the kids are lined up probably 200 um it's the weather's incredible it's a great outdoor event for such a good cause so that's one of them thank you we'll see what we can do about publicizing that for you okay thank you that takes care of the presentation by the sheriff's office and the code officer uh item four is the presentation of disability achievement center um we have jody armstrong he's your former mayor tommy and she's director of the outreach for the beach mobility mats so without further ado ms armstrong thank you mayor welcome hello council members last week i did a presentation to the berry island government council and vice vera invited me to speak before you today i represent disability achievement center i'm director of outreach we're the center for independent living pinellas and pasco we serve people of all ages and all disabilities our goal is to overcome barriers to independence one in seven people have a mobility impairment one in seven people cannot get to our villages today for nearly three years uh actually december 8th will be the three-year mark that the pinellas county council for persons with disabilities was launched it is the council that we're an advisory council to the board of common commissioners for all things disability related and i'd share that committee the very first meeting treasure island brought their brought their moby mac their beach access mat out they did a presentation showed the benefits of it the ease of care and it made a lot of sense because it enabled not only people who use wheelchairs to access the beach it's anyone with a mobility impairment if you have a bad knee a bad hip you're aging into disability and you've got vertigo you're not steady on your feet moms with strollers everybody in treasure island uses this map so for the last nearly three years i've been advocating up and down the beaches trying to encourage municipalities and the county to install these access mats where they make the most sense and earlier this summer another organization called help us gather it's another organization that works with people with disabilities they one of their members got a modeling job for surf style surf shop in florida water beach and this young gentleman uses a wheelchair and they did the photo shoot on the moby mat in treasure island and would help us gather found that they thought that was the neatest thing since sliced bread and they had babies a i did a piece on them and so i called the founder because i i've been working on this project for a long time and i said you know robin you just gotta get people out to the beach you know how many times you get the family coming down from up north to see grandma and grandpa and grandma and grandpa stand on the seawall and say see you later just like you guys you can't even go out there without an umbrella that just that blows me away speaking of people with disabilities um so we got to talking and she says well you know we have a family foundation and this kind of project for access can really make a difference for us here in pinellas county why don't i fund them i don't know i'm a grant writer when i have somebody say why don't i fund them i never get that well the press release went out and we found the interest because everyone that i went through and said hey would you please put one down and now i'm able to go and say hey let's do this now each of you has a map in front of you and there are currently four access mats in pinellas county and 15 proposed and pinellas and four in nesco the forward foundation will pay for all of them and uh the permit so right now we have we had a um a meeting a zoo meeting with all of the interested parties earlier in october it included anyone who would already raise their hand saying yes please count me in i'd like to have a man in my beach and uh fdep fwc we had representatives from nick descende's office from linda cheney's office everybody's on board with this so that now the permitting process is not over burdensome i even have an engineer who's willing to do these ones pro bono so we've got all the pieces in place and we are walking through the steps now of the permitting process madeira beach is ready to go and what i'm lining up is madeira beach had some questions on theirs and they were waiting for the questions to come back because that would give us an insight as to what else they what else fwc or fdep might want so now that they have their answers we're working through everyone else and we should see those permit applications going in with it by the end of the year everyone should have their permit applications in the permitting process is going to take some time you've already told us it's going to be months so we're trying very hard so my question for bel air beach is do you have an access point that you look and if like all you have to do is send an email to info help us gather dot org and say hey we'd like to be included that's all they're asking you have to ask and the foundation they understand the process they understand what we're going through what we're doing all the steps that we're taking and the way that it'll work is that once the permits are approved automatically will be the foundation will write a check to the city to write a check to the uh the map provider and that's really how it's going to the only thing they want you take care of the mat for as long as it's in use which should be five to seven years you have to take it up during hurricanes in each one of these roll-up masses this each section is about 48 pounds and uh they actually put a sign that's for mobility purposes and to include the three logos for disability achievement center helpless gather and forward foundation that's it i've never had an easier credit in my life so um if it's not right for you guys i understand it's okay but i do encourage because we're all one accident or else away from being the person with a disability and i moved here because of that sand most of us moved here because of that sand and i would really love to see everyone who can be able to get out there so there's lots of apps for everyone everybody wants one reach out to me i will work with you every step of the way first thank you for coming and you do a great great thing here and um it's very exciting um we can't just give you an answer tonight but we'll have a work session coming up in a couple of weeks and i'm going to ask that clip is on um we can get a consensus right there we're only asking for you're only asking for an email but there may be other questions we probably will be able to actually bring it for a resolution until december but that's not that long so that grant will still be here in case okay um we have one public beach access we have several beach walk overs but our main beach texas is morgan park now i'm mayor of this city but there's another city across the street that makes up 19 blocks that beller beach uses that's bel air shore they have commission meetings usually later in the month that's what we were talking about earlier the 6th street the 12th street 19th street access points all the beller beach residents who live in those areas use that so they may be interested in that also i'm not sure what kind of a cell you're going to have to get them but it's worth making that presentation there too so that all the citizens no matter where they may be in the city you know don't have to travel all to morgan park because that may be an inconvenience i don't have a picture of this do you have a picture or something that you might be able to send us but i'm not sure what they look like you know i've never seen i don't think i've seen them i do yeah um actually mobimet is the vendor that we have been working with that old man i drove him up and down these beaches for the last two and a half years measuring walking and giving me quotes so we pretty much know where what what's what's what and they have a really good website that's interactive that's really that yes okay console any other questions citizens wow you are getting you get easy grants and you get easy questions that's as good as it gets as a disability disability achievement centers we are strong advocates for persons with disabilities and um [Music] everybody should have the right to enjoy this beaches and enjoy it safely thank you so much we are going to have here even even if you don't if you choose not to there's still going to be enough to put pinellas county pinellas county the most accessible beaches in the state i can't say the world in the state new england has quite a few of them but this is a statewide effort there are many many municipalities around the state that are trying to do this naples has done a study they're trying to put one in every half mile but they don't have the funding we are the only county that has the funding so what we're going to do as soon as we get these down we're going to business and clean water to promote disability tourism that's a huge industry that's contact beautiful beaches thank you very much thank you for your great work all right that concludes the regular guard here we're gonna move into the consent agenda council will be doing okay we've been here now for an hour 10. everybody's all right we're not hearing any issues okay i'm gonna do it five six seven eight all part of the consent agenda we have approval of the september 20th 2021 city council

4th 2021 city council meeting minutes then item seven is approval of october 18 2021 city council work session minutes number eight is approval of city council monthly invoice for uh i'm sorry the city attorney monthly invoice for legal services so we're going to approve items five six seven and eight first step into motion motion by frank banker second by dave davis correction yes um on item number six the october fourth meeting um item number nine eight nine and ten it says they were moved from the regular agenda they were actually moved from the consent agenda to the regular agenda this is pages four and five of the october i'm sorry it says it says move to the regular agenda is that not correct um but then if you go further down on the next page on page four regular agenda approval of the september which has moved from the regular agenda from consent agenda to the right word right so i'm not sure following what the issue is twice it should be moved from the consent earlier it wasn't yes um and he said she could make that correction yeah um it's material council member detail but the my issue is that's a consent agenda we're not even supposed to discuss it so let me okay hang on we're going to get it right because what we should if this happens again please move that item out of the consent agenda but i'm not going to get hung up on the technicality here can does the council have any problem with amending this on the fly like this this is a minor this is to just keep the minutes proper we have any objection but we have none okay we'll do that so patty you're familiar with exactly the changes that have to happen right yes that's already changed [Music] all right so other than those changes we're good all right then so uh the motion right now is to approve the consent agenda um and that is items five six seven eight i'll read it again yes vote we'll approve this approval of the september 20th 2021 city council work session meeting minutes item six

i'll take a voice flow all in favor aye anyone opposed we have seven to zero passes move into the regular agenda item nine this is consideration of appointment to the board of adjustment this is a city council uh vote by ballot to fill vacant board seat uh we have an applicant tony gatlin uh first office mr gatlin here mr gators here are you gonna be here would you like to be heard okay hang on let me get the motion first and then invite you up okay first somebody make this motion move by dave dad a second okay second by robin aki council will you dispense with your comments until you after we heard from mr dabwith scout with the i'm really just here to help the community i think we should all do whatever we can to participate and i've got about 40 years doing research here in pinellas county cities counties state attorneys i think i can bring that knowledge to the world sit hang right there and see if there's any questions from the council while you're here okay this way you can answer back and forth okay council do we have any questions i have a comment on sure i know mr gatliff and i think he would be a great addition to the board of adjustment mr kevin i don't know i've seen some uh some writings here as well and it concerned me a little bit and i you know i i wouldn't say it's something that i would say i i certainly i see your background you certainly have an excellent background i think you'd be fine for the board i am a little concerned about some of the writings we hear earlier when we were speaking about this whole beach umbrella issue and what was going on yes it was and i'm reading some of the stuff that you wrote and it's directly contrary to what the law and the facts are so i want you to understand and you might know this already but i want to say this for anybody who serves on this board and mike kelly's here and he'll confirm this i know i'm right on it this is what's called quasi-judicial board you don't report to us actually the next line of review after you make your decision as a court they look at what you do so if an applicant comes before the board of adjustment your decision is final you speak for the city that's why you're a judicial board and that calls marrying the facts to the law and my concern is is some of the stuff that i'm reading here is directly it's incorrect some of the stuff that you posted out on facebook okay i'll tell you beach umbrellas basically your idea that the city can make whatever law it wants that's not correct and you heard about the constitutionality you heard about i mean it gets even more detailed when we start getting into the what the deeds themselves say in terms of our perpetual rights then you get into what's this the whole this whole issue which isn't even formed yet in the court about this whole constitutional right to the wet sand and for recreation that they don't you know it's not simple and the only reason was and then there was another one another comment on um on when the city cut down uh butchered the seals which still haven't grown back and we said there was no laws violated well i got the dep report that wasn't all violated okay we're not supposed to cut them that well and it was an error a bad error and it's never going to happen again and i don't want to give this information to the citizens i don't doubt that you want to help citizens but i will caution you that you know what you're going on is that this board everything that you do on this board is subject to review so if somebody doesn't get that variance so they don't like what they say or somebody writes something you know now the city goes to well you know they go to take the city to court and it starts to get ugly so that's all i want to say those comments are on social media yes everybody shares their opinions and they're frankly their personal right to speak their mind but i appreciate your comments counsel i'm gonna come to the uh to the citizens right after council any other council comments or questions from mr gableth now let's open it up to the citizens we have mike kelly um i'm just gonna have you step just right in that doorway there let's have mike kelly speak and then if you need to answer it or rebut it you get the mic again yes and uh council member would like to speak when you're ready okay i'll take him what we'll do is i'll take him right after this and then i'll go back to other citizen comments mike's here standing here so let's have mike if clint doesn't have a problem with that mr gunn no problem okay once again i'm mike kelly i'm speaking in this capacity as the current chairman of board of adjustments i'm here actually to let you know that on a personal level and a pleasure level i have been i have known tony gatlin for over 27 years i had the privilege of serving with him and uh participating with him on a very successful men's softball league back in the 90s tony is a very dependable man he's a very dedicated man and he's a man of character so i'm here to endorse this appointment to report adjustment if our world adjustment is also a board that has to be dependable has to be credible and has to be careful because what what the issues are before us um it is very respectful of our citizens and i would hope that you appoint mr gatlin that he would be a good addition and respectful person his character as well natural thank you very well thank you i disagree with any of that mr guppy no i [Music] okay um any other citizen comments you might want to turn that up patty because it was a little hard to hear that why do you have the floor thank you yeah i just want to say that uh trust and confidence i think he's a uh a person of character and i think some of the comments he made on social media were direct response to a lot of misstatements and misconceptions and and just vile statements i'm very surprised and while i agree with mayor mazzo's comment and as well as mr keller's comments that board members must remain impartial i'm surprised we're having this conversation now but in speaking with when a sitting member of a board was on social media waiting in on events taking place and uh espousing a lot of misperceptions and misinformation and again i'm just very surprised we're having this conversation now while we're considering a new member and we never had this conversation when we had this issue as so i i'm fully in support of uh breaking the board mr dallas i think he is a first step character and he has my full trust and confidence as a member of the uh thank you very much thank you mr gun mr gal if you have anything to add on that i am going to say something but if you might want to speak after i go but it's up to you go ahead okay so um everybody has a right to give information but this is attributed to you if it's not you please tell me tony gable of bel air beach didn't the umbrella hoopla teach us that the land to the mean high water mark is private land that's not correct um if so then no laws were broken this is in regard to the uh the sea oats the um the has nothing to do with the mean high water mark it has to do with what's known as the coastal construction control line which in our city is pretty much equal to the retaining wall which is why there was no violation on 6th street but there was partial violation a lot of violation on 12th street complete violation of 19th street and complete violation on working street i've got the florida ddp report here and i'm not going to read it into the record but it talks about the violations over here so again anybody has the right to write whatever they want okay but if we're going to help the citizens which i don't doubt that you really do want to do okay i want to help them with the right information that was bad what happened that was destruction of our beautiful seacoast and it better never happen again i reported it and i'll report it again next time and i am told from the ddp we will not get a break if it happens again though cos still haven't grown back and although sixth street was behind the coastal construction line because that retaining wall is actually in front of the dunes if you go there and i was just there friday because i was enjoying the high surf and let me tell you the erosion that's there is is significant though cos hold the grasses together and right after those things were cut we had another storm and wiped out a lot of sand and that sand has never come back so i just want to make sure the residents get the right information this report is public record is sitting in paddy gentry has it's from florida it's addressed made from july 29th so i don't you go on social media write whatever you want but again if you want to help the citizens like particularly on the board now you'll be a representative of our city you know i'm just asking that make sure we get our facts straight most of my comments were in response to others who [Music] also didn't necessarily have their facts [Music] thank you for your uh interest here council do you have any other questions with mr gabriel before we take up our discussion and vote let's have a seat we're gonna we don't have to go send us out to the election division we do this right in front of you here um any other questions before we call the boat patty has given us how can we use the ones that are inside our um our binder so inside our binder we have a vote and now i'll make sure i can say this properly we have one person on the ballot this isn't like north korea though it doesn't say you have to vote for one you may vote for up to one that person is tony gatlin so yes vote will get him on he needs the majority of this council to be watching these four votes please um vote yes or no and hand your ballot to patty lynn we always do this if you just have to tally to vote so we have a double count so she's just doing this to build suspense she knows who won already but [Music] council member aki voted for mr gatlin councilmember banker voted for mr gatlin council member notaro voted for mr gatlin council members voted for mr gatlin vice mayor gaddis did not vote wait he has a quote that's okay oh she distracted me it's the hanging shed and how did mr gaddis vote after he voted [Music] even with the questionable vote of the vice mayor you win to zero congratulations um [Music] and you know i saw that we had a thing a little while ago where the city attorney had given some instructions and stuff to one of the groups i think you were on the group because i was looking at it about sunshine law and stuff like that you i think you're familiar with that right the sunshine laws if you can't speak outside the uh board business like you can't speak to mike anymore about the board other than we got a meeting on tuesday or something like that if there's any questions fred reilly here is the city attorney you could always ask him but it's always better to ask in advance than to do something and find out that you violated the law florida's very strict essentially you can't talk about anything other than like do we have a meeting on tuesday you can't say hey i really think that's a great idea we should give that guy the doc can't do that mr kelly councilmember ben i'm sorry would you hold that up again amanda yes i didn't count mr uh council member gun he wouldn't really this is like broward county here okay so council member gunn how do you vote the second corrected vote still has you as the winner you only need four anyway so even if someone challenges it we got it so still congratulations mr kelly yeah your comment was correct about sunshine laws and proper training we had in march as most of you know a board of adjustment training session since that time we have the council has appointed three new members of the board of adjustment it might be worthwhile for us as a board when if you and i can do another training session in the next six months it will be good for the council the board of test members that have already heard it once but for three new city members that will give them more confidence in the upcoming year we'll see if i can dispense with this right here okay um council he's made a proposal we don't need a resolution for this i think it's a great idea i don't think anybody's going to disagree but if we do does anybody have an issue with um he has three new members and so that's almost the majority of the evidence we have seven seven on the board right so three three of them have been appointed since march actually since may after our training session in march so i just think it might be strong to do it again friend if you um hang on let me get you the approval first okay so does anybody have a problem with that so now we can fred if you would work out with mr kelly and with um the city manager what a convenient time i would like to go make sure this time that um we can get all three people there so whatever we have to do to make the three work whether it be a saturday morning or whatever fred loves working saturday morning so we'll make it work for everybody here's those three i'm sure we'll be here good suggestion thanks all right let's move on to item number 10. oh boy all right consideration of ordinance 2102 an ordinance of the city council of the city of baylor beach florida providing for the amendment of chapter 86 signs of the city code of ordinance providing for incorporation recitals providing for the amendment of chapter 86 signs of the city code of ordinance providing for a copy to be kept on file providing versability providing for the repeal of all ordinances in conflict herewith and providing for an effective date it doesn't say here but patty correct me if i'm wrong this is the first reading correct first reading meaning two before we can pass it uh first i'll need a motion summary second second second by leslie deteron i will defer to the city attorney fred riley any comments on this and by the way folks just to give you a quick background we have been debating this in work sessions for probably five months now so with that mr romney in the last workshop the city council discussed this at length it was one of a number of as the mayor said one of a number of times it's been discussed i made several changes to it that came out of that workshop there are a new definition for activated component and a new definition for activated signs and i changed the reference elsewhere in the chapter 86 to activated signs so that report has been clarified there was a winky discussion at the workshop about that was led by city manager reeves about the the actual size of the signs and the uh that so that amount was or that that was quantified and the signs will not exceed the temporary signs will not exceed four square feet and those there was another change that uh leslie materow requested where there was a sentence that had been repeated twice so one of the those was deleted and i really don't think there was that much more that we made in the way of revisions so this is you know other than those couple things i want to say there's one more very minor point but those those are the major things that have changed and that's it's now on the court for the city council to wrestle on first reading first i want to thank you mr riley and i want to thank the city council we have went around and around on this thing not because it's an easy issue because it's a very difficult issue uh signage is the first amendment right okay first amendment rights obviously are you know the cornerstone there's a reason why it's the first amendment and not the you know seventh amendment um and you have to be careful in what you restrict and how you restrict it and this was the best compromise that the city council was able to come up with and walk that fine line and the problem we're walking the fine line as mr reilly has said and as i've said as attorneys um you can't see the line the line's all squiggly and the line is all gray and it's dark at night and the courts are all over the place with this stuff so i think a council member had asked you know does this guarantee that we're not going to ever have an issue you know with somebody breaking a legal issue no it doesn't guarantee anything somebody can always make that challenge fred reilly cites a whole bunch of case laws that went you know the various appellate courts and supreme courts that are all unsigned ordinances and stuff so this is the best attempt and i don't want anyone this is the best attempt at this council and i don't want anyone um i'll say picked on if it doesn't work out if three years from now somebody says hey there's a problem in there that's not any one of the people's fault that did this you cannot bullet proof this this is way better than what we had okay what we had is a problem in fact it was so bad we actually suspended the enforcement of it so this is a great compromise i will be voting for it and i encourage everyone else to do the same anyone else i have a comment uh yeah i'll go to frank and then you're on the second round okay frank i appreciate the work you did mr riley on this i understand your argument mr mayor the problem is it grew from six pages to 26 pages it's just too convoluted for me i can't support it i understand there could be litigation coming forward but there could be litigation on everything that we do so again no offense mr riley i think he did a great job but let him take no i was just going to add that this is many many months in the works many many hours we've spent on this i know it looks a little overwhelming and it is it takes a long time to get through this however in the event that something does come up in the future i believe that anyone would look at this documentation and see we tried everything we could to satisfy the needs of the city and our signed ordinance so i'm for it so we will go to the citizens then citizens any comments on the sign ordinance john hansen plays here john hanson 22nd street i've read through this you know it's taken a lot of time it's taken a lot of hard work and as previously mentioned it's really grown but my concern is um there's a couple of things in here to that question in section 86-64 permitted temporary signs um give us a second to get to that okay sure it's easier just give us a page page 21 of your package okay it's a sub-paragraph charlie placement standard temporary signs and support structures are to be posted not less than eight feet from the back of the curb of a street that should not be posted on or over a public right-of-way or easement i get that this talks about um the boulevard out here in gulfport where it caused the causeway and the gulf coast that part without actually taking a tape measure and measuring from the back of the concrete curve eight feet in puts it on the sidewalk for sure if not on private property okay go to the next page uh 22 and it would be do you mind if i just hold that but best person to ask on this if you don't mind trying to you just brought something up because um you know usually we don't most of the streets do not have sidewalks so you just take when i did the election you take three paces off the curb and seem to keep me out of lin's hair for most of them so but what about this when we do have a sidewalk how do we handle this one mr reeves typically for for us we just use the back of the sidewalk for both the back of the side wall typically that keeps it because it's in [Music] the the way the code reads you're not supposed to put it the wrong way so if it comes from eight foot back to the sidewalk it's not in the right way and on the side streets we use a foot from the back of the curb because some right now that's not what this says on the next page it says eight feet from the pavement asphalt where is that mr hands it's under location as persons who live on streets other than go for the cause of ebola may place temporary signs and shall be looked not look shall not be located closer than eight foot to the paved roadway and shall be placed only on the public property now there's an easement on everybody's property right now that's honestly the i'll tell you how i do it and i think it depends how we're going to consider the valley kirk i take it eight feet from the valley curve i think that's the way we write this but you really aren't supposed to be driving the ballot curve but it's it's not the pavement but you say valid curb yeah and see it says back of the curve of the street that's what it says placement standard eight feet from the back of the curve right but then mr hansen alerted us to you you go to page 1 location and under the sub paragraph 2 or 3 well this is actually an exception for the only for the open house and garage sale science so it's not all the other signs that were the temporary signs so there's there's a slight difference for open house and garage sale size there there is a difference between the two i don't think they conflict so maybe somebody needs to clarify with an upcoming election because the way i interpret this you can't have any political signs in the right of way [Music] even in front of city hall on election day between a sidewalk and a curb number two you can't have a mount gulf boulevard because those little wire thingies are not going to penetrate the concrete sidewalk and if you go above the sidewalk you're on private property if i want to put a garage sale sign or i want to put holiday decorations that are temporary in my half moon in front of my house i gotta put an eight foot that puts him up under the palm trees you guys need to clarify a little better what you're trying to tell us because basically you're saying here you're not going to violate our constitutional rights but they're extremely limited the way i read this when it comes to the actual placement that's correct okay um and again i'll speak only for myself but i'm pretty sure every candidate did this i didn't hear of any election violations except there were people who placed stuff in front of city hall and that's inappropriate um you're not allowed to post put stuff on the boulevard if you put it on the strip between the sidewalk and the street it doesn't belong there that would be in violation even under our old one if you place it on the grass and i had many on both boulevard um and so did other people you need the owner's permission every one of those was with the owner's permission you cannot place it on someone's property um and you you had to actually knock down the door and make sure they said it's okay to put it there so no you have no right to place it on anyone's property or vacant lot for that matter no i clearly understand that but the way i'm reading this and i was taught very clearly when i wrote policies and procedures in the military to read objectively don't read into it the way i read this ordinance it effectively does violate my constitutional rights based on where you can place it well on page 24 under political signs number two it says when you were talking about upcoming political cycle it says all setbacks set forth um little political signs they may not be less than seven and one half feet from the edge of any road service or not less than two feet from any existing sidewalk adjacent to the private property so did that cover that still push my i mean any political sign i would desire to place in my front yard it's going to put it up in the palm trees and just to be clear i would take a measurement to head measure either from the probably from the back of the uh gutter the concrete gutter just to be safe the extra inch several inches so that somebody doesn't come along and take it out of my yard even though it's that edge is an easement but it's still i pay the taxes on that we've always allowed the placement of the easement okay because if you didn't i remember a quote lynn directly every sign would be like you know because i think you have 15 15 feet in front of every yard or so with easement so you would actually be 15 feet into you nobody would be able to you might as well not even have signs okay so it's always been off of the curb um but not to obscure traffic so i didn't have i mean this to me was clear enough and we do require i mean under uh 86-64 b which is on page 21. it does talk about those temporary signs shall be erected on any property whether the authorization of the owner or resident thereof except it's provided so i mean it's if somebody sticks a sign in somebody's property and without authorization you just throw it away i mean it's right no i get i get that part i'm just talking about me the property owner but again the way i read this as it's written it restricts my constitutional right to freedom of expression that's all i wanted to say i'm just trying to understand i don't know i think i can explain this i believe that what we've done is we've we've set a rule where he he has no place to put aside is that because i was going to ask because i don't know i've driven by it too many times but i don't remember where the palm trees are is it because your palm trees are in the way or is it because in my property i have a rounded driveway okay because there's no on street parking right okay on the back side of that circumference if you will is where the palms are and i have one big one in the center that's getting taller but i'll go tomorrow and i'll measure and i'll shoot you in there just where would that be you know i'm i'm aware of john's there's a couple other houses he he's got landscaping there right now to the wings of his yard there's probably grass areas which he could put a sign there but there's a lot of houses that have that curved with landscaping yes if you took it seven feet off the curb you might be in the middle of that landscaping and you wouldn't see anything right but that's true landscaping right that's right we give you the option if you i mean you know i hate to say you can put the sign in or you can keep the landscaping and you might not be able to do both depending on your setup but we you know i mean the reason why it's seven feet is for safety that's why it's seven feet it's so that you look down and block and you can see if the neighbor's car is pulling out of the driveway because i'll tell you you know coming up to a political season you've got a lot of signs on the street and you cannot see down the street so easily as you can like right now where there's nothing out there so that was the whole idea behind the seven seven and a half feet eight feet wherever it is it's really strictly a safety thing but um you know your results may vary depending on how your lock is so we'll figure something out any other citizens yes sir uh good evening mayor anzo and city council members my name is nicholas michael zabel i reside at 3320 hibiscus drive west i am the student of the public policy and administration program under the direction of just jeff cronstall at petersburg college i come before you tonight to speak on agenda item number 10 about the city ordinance regarding chapter 86 and signs this would be the ordinance or this would be the consideration of ordinance 21-02 an ordinance of the city council of the city of delaware beach providing for the amendment of chapter 8 signs of the city code ordinances providing from corporations may i interrupt you if you will you have three minutes and i want you to make the most of it we know the ordinance it's in front of us we believe we know this one go right into what you want to tell us okay all right in its current state this ordinance under the general provisions well watch him i'm sorry okay in its current state this ordinance regulates how signs are that city limits may be displayed depending on the type of signage it states when and where the sign may be placed depending on the depending upon the type of problem it also determines the size of the posted signage under general provisions of section 86-61 item number five uh it states that any site including its base which is broken or damaged or which becomes unsightly shall be repaired by the property owner or agent of the owner who is responsible for a sign what is there in this ordinance that determines the meaning of the word not cyclic is it a matter which it is is that a matter which is left between the property owner and the code enforcement in some ways can this be used by members of the city to restrict freedom of speech because they dislike a sign believe it to be uncycling while i can understand the importance of keeping the city looking nice as it attracts more people to move here my main concern is the protection of a citizen's freedom of speech i believe that this is something the city council should investigate as it could be interpreted differently than it was intended which could cause future officers in the future that's all i have to say about that excellent thank you very well said um and now you've given us something else to look at here so and you actually had a little bit extra time too [Music] no problem we knew what you were talking if you don't mind staying up there i'm gonna you know again we've done a lot of debate on this and this is the gentleman mr zabe you've come forward and highlighted something that even in you know all the readings we've done you you know this is how when i say it people say you're being a lawyer well so is he and then you know what i'd rather he do this here than somebody doing it up in federal court so with that said i'm going to turn it over because this is what we have our city attorney for mr rightly um do we want to make any comments on this and you know he raises an issue here that may require some discussion i'm going to look at your look for your legal guidance on this one the the comment he's made is related to section 86-61 uh subsection five correct that is correct okay his comment was that regarding really the word one's unsightly it's not defined well there's and this is repetitive because i've already said it but we've spent more than a year going over this there have been a lot of things where that have been defined been further defined that was one of the the things that we felt or the council felt and directed me to address was places where there was it would be helpful to have a better definition than the one that we had and we've gone through and added actually quite a few different definitions the word unsightly is um there's a lot of things just so you understand how this was put together there were certain things that uh in the drafting process that were changed and i know this will be good for a laugh but i tried to change as little as i possibly could the thing that was the major change to the ordinance was oriented towards establishing the basis for the city to say we want a ordinance that supports a [Music] attractive community and we have standards that will make this an attractive community and i always would use the same example bel air beach and is a residential community and bel air beach is not us 19 or almost any section that you choose it's simply those are two different worlds so a lot of the stuff that was added was going to show or to to give a basis for why these things are justified um based on what the community needs are and what the community standards are that the city council has debated a lot of those my my legal answer to the question about the word uncycling is if a word is not typically defined in a statute or an ordinance then it's given the normal and customary usage of the word so you know unsightly to most people would mean you know something that's dilapidated or in disrepair or that type of thing ultimately if there's a any action taken it would be typically through code enforcement and if somebody had a code enforcement case which would not be before the city council the special magistrate for the code enforcement hearing would make a determination whether that was uh unconstitutionally vague or not if the case hinged on that one word i personally am not uncomfortable with the the words which are broken or damaged or which becomes unsightly those to me are pretty good legal standards and most people would have some understanding of what those meant so my my answer is i don't think it needs to be revised sure i think the key word you need to look at is which or two words is which becomes so at the time it was installed it it was not unsightly it became that way later so that that would indicate to me that uh we're looking at wear and tear and my question you know at one point uh isn't determined that it becomes unsightly like oh there's you know scratched up a tiny bit but it's still you know overall intact but not over you know it's not it's the you know it's the vagus of that of that word you know anything i you can be considered unsightly if it's mark you know marred weather or whatever so i'm just wondering at what point is it considered on cyclone mr zabal i'm going to actually agree with attorney riley and vice mayor [Music] i love making these things apart that's like a hobby of mine but um i don't have a problem with this one and i'll tell you why um and it's a good observation and listen if you're not an attorney you should think of becoming one because this is this is something somebody could challenge but you're not gonna be able to challenge it because you don't like the message on it because that doesn't make it unsightly and there's a famous supreme court opinion about pornography and they said well what does that mean in the judge said we know it when we see it okay there's a sign i know somebody sends a picture around not too long ago um this thing was out there three years ago when i was campaigning for mayor it was it's rusty it's falling apart it's on an angle i don't know why it hasn't been pulled and stuck in city hall's dumpster okay um it's on a vacant lot it's unsightly okay but then there's new ones now i'm not a scratch i mean i think that would be unreasonable there's a there's a division of reasonableness i think if you were here earlier you heard me talking about be reasonable you know so any sign could have a little bit of weathering but to the point you know where the lettering is worn off of it or it's rusty or the chain is no longer holding the side i mean then we start to get there what's that point i mean there's a lot of things where how much is too much you know i just wrote a just finished an appeal on how much was too much in a legal standard in terms of a video that was shown to the jury how much was too much and um it's balancing act that's basically what the court would say it's a balancing act so excellent observation i'm okay with it the way it is right now but um if anybody ever gets nailed on this one and the other thing i'll tell you too is our code enforcement didn't authority is left here but our focus on code enforcement we just had a meeting on this is supposed to be about gaining compliance and education so we're not supposed to be the gestapo and we come in and go we don't like your sign and it's getting pulled out and thrown in the truck and you can get it from lynne reeves and he's going to charge you 10 bucks that's not what we're about you know somebody should come if they think the signs get a little rusty or whatever they should have that discussion with you like hey maybe throw a little paint on or something like that um that's what it's supposed to work the reason why we're actually doing this because it didn't work that way we had a couple signs that were confiscated in towns and he gave the town and people came right in there and they were they didn't threaten to sue us but they told us that they could have and they we all know they had a point so that's where we're coming from i don't know if it satisfies you i think you still have a you have a good finding here but um i think it's clear enough at least for me as an attorney mr banker i think he raises a good point i put a frank backward sign out for council you don't like it you throw an egg at it is it on set with you you know getting towards that you know definition that you have one second and someone reports it as outside because they don't like kids that's kind of a genuine guy they're gonna have a hard time if they don't like it but you know if the sign becomes unsightly somebody paints it over well you might have to frank's gonna have to dig into his campaign treasury and replace that one um but one of the other things that we have here is i mean and this i'm gonna say this to the city manager now because it should be highlighted to code we aren't gonna be coming up on election soon you can sit there with mr hansik and his tape measure and get this thing down perfect and make sure you have exactly right and some landscapers cutting the lawn and he moves your side he doesn't know our ordinance and it's supposed to be 7.35 feet he doesn't know that okay so code should be about compliance move the door and sign move them around i know i moved a million of them because people get the long cut every week and a lot signs move we put them in the right spot a candidate's will but other people move them and you know again this is supposed to be about just getting just moving where they belong now if somebody puts a wall wrong they might have a little call with that person and say read the rules but you know just want to highlight that because it's not you know somebody can move them they move by accident they don't know but again your signs should be confiscated if we do that that's too heavy-handed i will never support that kind of code enforcement never i don't think anybody on this council did i don't know if we helped you but you have you raised me a good point thank you for your time to help me dr sanders excellent observation thank you any other citizens yes sir i think it was trying to deal with big seven uh world number nine um for bright flashing lights it says lesson you just may want to consider whether putting an amendment in later or just putting it down but like i mentioned that the work session is that photophobia and photo bright lights being flashed can cause neurological disorders causing either in some cases for people with migraines for other people with bipolar disorder and for epilepsy and they've even made cities take off their their photo radars because it has stimulated attacks for people who have caused accidents and so i would hate for us to be stimulating any of those neurological disorders because we don't have something in there that keeps us from having the flashing signs of what problems [Music] we do have something on page 8 thank you um that says to regulate signs so as not to interfere or struck the vision of or distract motorist bicycles or pedestrians so argue that it's under there maybe not as clear as you said it though you know um [Music] thank you any other citizen comments yes um are these going to apply to our sign out here out front these regulations should apply every sign on the zone okay so my concerns are that um if you read this there's quite a number um and as uh mr riley said we're not for a residential community we're not us 19 so um i'm looking at page seven i mean seven and eight um you look at these and it's um number five maintain and enhance the scenic beauty of the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development growth that concerns me are we going to be putting advertising on or something out there and then number seven minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property a number of houses here that border the pond and behind the pond and so i think we need to take a a good look at how long that sign is going to be on at night if we're going to allow it to flash messages because that definitely will impact property values it will impact people's ability to sleep because you're going to have a sign flashing in your your we're going to have it flashing in our family room window all night long and i don't believe that that will improve my property values i don't believe that the people who live behind the pond in fact i know they won't because i talk to them their front windows face that and that even the street lights reflect on the pond all the way across the pond i would encourage you all to come over and look at that because the street lights reflect across that pond so if you look at page eight um uh quickly aside from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the lots and the joining law for my permitted use is for residential so i would believe that that would uh conflict with that um i i just i think that we really need to think about this and put some things in here because we're going to have digital science on the boulevard in front of the motel uh in front of the beach club and certainly the condos will once they go in front of the motel the beach cup condos will put them up there because we allow short-term rentals and we'll be advertising there so i would like um strongly suggest that you look at how you're going to regulate digital signs city attorney if you wish to comment on any of this i mean again citizens are raising issues here i know we've we we're hoping to move this to a vote tonight um but we want an ordinance that's good here this is legislative intent that she was looking for so overall the legislative intent is kind of the idea behind the governing principles that's what we're trying to shoot for okay um it doesn't mean you're going to hit everyone perfectly but mr ryan i'm going to have you address this because i'm not going to speak on the well i'll address that by saying that that this list of things is what um or as he said that his specific legislative attempt to explain the basis for the regulation that follows so this is the predicate for other things and saying what is important within this community a lot of the several of the things that you highlighted could it could it be handled slightly differently of course it could i will say what has been said already several times that city council and i and city manager have spent a year on this and there have been a lot of things that were brought up in work sessions and elsewhere that were debated and this current ordinance that you have in front of those you was what the result is and if if there's further things that the council feels strongly enough to revisit and before you you approve it then the thing to do is not go forward personally i think that's a mistake for for a couple reasons you'll once it's passed there's always an opportunity to amend it any later date if if necessary part of the reason to try and get this done now is because there is an election that will be coming up and pretty soon it will be election season and part of the object of doing this was to address how the political signs would be handled and if the city council goes another month or two without passing the ordinance then then you're back in the quandary of how you handle science during the political season so i'm not diminishing in any way shape or form the comments you're making but i'm saying this if you read through that very lengthy list of things all those are oriented towards going to court at a later date and saying judge we made every reasonable effort we possibly could to state what was important for our community and why we created these standards that that we did in order to make sure that the aesthetic value of our community is is intact that's what it's for and again you you can you could artfully state it a different way but you can always do that and i can i would encourage the city council to to you're running out of time in my opinion with respect to this because you really need something in place with respect to the political season and i i'm i'm the first one i want the legal standard to be as absolutely clear as it possibly can be and there's you know to be quite honest with you there's always a way to make it uh clarify things but this this is a year's worth of effort to get to this point so that's my response [Music] um two things um i agree with fred riley regarding this political season coming up none of the council members did this but we had a gentleman in this town um ran banners that filled his roof you could see him from the waterways okay uh for a presidential candidate and one wasn't enough but the guy put up three of them okay i think i never saw all three but i was told he had three of them that's an eyesore and you know what it happened to be my guy that he was advertising for it doesn't matter with my guy or the next guy it just that's not what the city is looking for we don't want to stop the first amendment right to stick a sign out saying vote for president smith but we want to say you know you're not going to matter the size of your roof i mean that that kills everyone's value let me say this about this sign outside here okay as you look at this council here if you start from robert frank bankrupt myself on that sign people over here yes that's right now unimportant the sign passed through a democratic process we had a lot of debate there was a good debate really was okay four to three have passed but we were told okay and even being on the minority that we lost that that sign's not going to flash and that sign's not going to be on all night and it's not going to be an eyesore and i'm telling you if it becomes an eyesore and then and that starts happening okay you know how to reach me okay i'll bring that motion i have the right to bring that motion i will not let that happen in this city okay and hopefully we'll get four votes and we'll stop that okay that is not what that sign is supposed to be this is not a car wash it's not a strip club we're not gonna have that in this city okay it's supposed to blink on and off and i don't know who is driving gulf boulevard and causeway boulevard at two in the morning that needs to know what our next council meeting is okay they can wait till the next day uh as far as i'm concerned that sign should go off at a reasonable hour nine or ten o'clock that's mildly eight or nine it may be fine that's us the people in this town are retired i agree traffic is minimal there but so i guess my my my sarcastic cognitive i could put a political sign in my front yard that followed these that was digital because there's one across the street um i'll only leave it i'm the league open you will come from the town attorney not for me page 17 section 86.5 exemptions this chapter shall not apply to subsection c signs for the benefit of the citizens is authorized by the city manager city council or other government authority having jurisdiction in the state so effectively this chapter does not apply to the street the sign out in front of the community center last paragraph on page 17. well there's another constitution which if you want to argue it we may never get this done i mean you know we're in a residential this is what we're talking about okay this molly are 100 correct you're in the same neighborhood you face each other why can't you have a digital sign why can't it be the same size why are we exhibiting ourselves i mean okay pretty much yes that's what we're becoming so then we can't that's there's your constitutional challenge because it's one thing for me to say are you to say frank on your street i want a digital sign we can say wait a minute you know anybody else has one here she's directly opposite this she's in the same situation other than she's not a government entity but we're exempting ourselves now government entities sometimes exempt themselves so you know this is this is the problem with signing ordinances we could do this forever i don't know anymore i really don't i mean you have a lot of hair um glenn gunn and then back to council up here glenn gunn yes thank you i agree with frank banker to begin with i think this whole thing the pendulum is swung too far in the opposite direction and this whole sign thing is origins changes taking on a life of its own i think it's absurdly long and gets scripted with what we're trying to accomplish here as i brought up at the work session here i think the biggest issue we're going to run into is electronics signs and how they relate to commercial businesses and i think we've missed the mark on this and this ordinance is incomplete and it's it's not ready to go for print yeah it's to get where we are but i think you're going to try to push this through and then kick the most needy portion of this thing down the road and it's going to be another year or two before those questions are answered and surprisingly the biggest sign issue that's garnered the residential pushback was the electronic sign and yet that's not included in the sign urges to address some of the concerns of debbie and roger law ever since we started talking about this electronic sign we've been trying to state that we look at the best practices for the implementation of electronic science and what other municipalities have done but everybody seems to keep latching on to this commercial version and as mayor lonzo puts in the car wash or the movie theater or whatever and that's not the case several times we've talked about the standards we want to use to implement this sign and ever once has anybody come in to kind of review those things to relate their fears i think it's incumbent upon this city to set the bar for how you implement electronic signs and we need to take the hybrid of this and set the example of commercial businesses and absolutely avoid the flashing signs and storm induced uh epileptic kits and as a helicopter pilot i can speak to that all day long but we need to be the exemplary person in right now thank you very much thank you mr gun council members i'd like to address mr gunn's comments uh originally uh or the last time we the last conversation we had about this was that this was geared primarily towards changes for residences and uh we would have to come back and append this at a later date and i thought that the council committed to continue working on this immediately so whether we pass this now or we hold off until we we finish the commercial version i don't have a problem with what we have in front of us i agree though that it is incomplete and i believe the recollection is correct as i recall to say that mr gunn did bring this up frankly next um about the digital sign um and that we need to work in on that and here's my problem okay right now we have really no residential sign we have an ordinance but we're not going to we're not enforcing it which is a free-for-all and luckily the citizens have been most understanding respectful and good i mean even without an ordinance i don't see any eyesores around the city so people are self-regulating and they're doing a good job okay i applaud the citizens for that i remember before i ever saw office sitting in that ordinance or audience and listening to our then fred reilly our then city attorney talk about passing an incomplete um ordinance and i almost fell off my chair called you can't do that and they did it anyway i don't think they ever fixed it um and i'm hearing stuff tonight and i'm seeing stuff that you know even though you've read through this a million times you see it and stuff keeps getting pointed out it is it's very big it's a very big ordinance um it's not ready right now but it it here's our problem we can table it or we can vote it down we got to keep working on it and we are going to run out of time because um and then i have all the political candidates hopefully will regulate themselves or we'll get people putting up banners that are the size of their roof i'm not sure what they'll line up with um so before i mean we've debated this i'm gonna if there's no other comments actually the uh dave you have the last word is that the last word does anybody else want to speak after dave i have no other comments okay frank did you want to say something or then we're going to give dave another opportunity if anybody here's what we're going to do frank wants to say something rest of council and dave ultimately will get to you last if you want to say anything more just like mr gunn says i don't think it's ready to yet these citizens are brought up some great comments uh i remember there was a bill passed years ago the speaker of the house back then said you got to pass the bill to something i remember and i'm still waiting to see how good it is um i i just think it should be are you making motion to table we're making a motion we have a second on motion to table no second that motion fails any other council comments i i would date here from what i was understanding the same thing he said that we were kind of passing this from a residential and then the commercial aspect would come later but i do agree there's a slippery slope because we very easily if we wanted to take advantage with this digital sign outside and use it as times square if we decided to nothing and this would stop us so that's going to be a checks and balance on us but i think that what we have so far is good but we definitely do further work from the commercial and the digital sign on front i'm going to agree with you know i wanted to move this thing forward if we could before the reasons that riley gave i think those are all valid reasons and can benefit this community and at the risk and i hope this doesn't happen that somebody goes hog wild um i don't think this is ready for prime time still there's a couple things that have just been pointed out tonight that weren't totally apparent you can blame us i mean it is a long ordinance i've read through it a number of times but you just missed stuff and um there's a lot so um this thing may not pass tonight which will get us back to the drawing board and if it doesn't pass tonight and ask that we stick it right back on the work session we're going to keep working on this until it kills us but you know we're going to try we still have a chance we have december and january it can become law in january so we still cover the season if we can get through this council if we can get to the next work session with it but there's a lot here still one more thing because fred what do you recommend based on all these comments sorry to put you on the spot i appreciate your guidance vice mayor got us summed up and what i thought y'all had decided that the last workshop was the digital sign component would would be something we would work on immediately if i i don't necessarily agree with the various comments but again say in drafting this there's a lot of things i didn't change at all because that wasn't the tone of the discussion that the city council had so the things that were made you know all season for example purposes what john hansek said there's no grand design on anybody's part to violate constitutional rights and with design placement it that i i know conclusively those were standards that that existed prior to this which is why they weren't changed no nobody raised an issue about changing them and the the city council in in addressing this in as many sessions as it's been addressed did so in a good faith manner to try and work through all the different debate topics that there were if you all are not ready to pass it then don't pass it and we'll go back to the drawing board but i will will say the the digital sign thing will introduce a whole new element into the discussion and i i my feeling is you you will not be able to pass a sign ordinance that includes the digital element if if you're trying to get this done before the uh the election season begins with one caveat unless you have special meanings and you can do it that way if you so choose but that's your your you know i i would suggest if if you're not ready if people are not ready to go forward with it then i will read i've highlighted the various things that were discussed tonight i will do red changes to those things and y'all can address it at a workshop in the very near future and hopefully these types of issues can be it can be addressed but i don't like passing something that somebody has uh you know endless questions about but i will tell you it's it's this is a very i've said this all alone this stuff is a quagmire because of the the various ways that the courts have handled it and you know you can go through and look for things to uh cite as a basis for a challenge and you can do that with any law that's even uh more accessible with something like this so that's that's my thoughts on it so if we pass this and the plan is to go back and do the digital aspect would that be an amendment to it you would have that whole section that addressed digital signs it this this is chapter 86 you would have certainly several provisions that are specific to digital science then we go through the two you know past first time publication past second time and then it becomes ordinance well i'm wondering if just for feasibility and to make it more simple trying to pass this one before the political with a vehicle promise and put it on the work session right now to start the digital aspect and get that passed as soon as possible because i have a feeling that what's going to happen is we're going to go back to our section we're going to work out all these it's going to come up with the first readings someone's going to find something else and then we're going to work on those and we're never going to get this done so should we just focus on this and pass this and then put a separate provision for digital signs only work on that and get that done you know the digital sign is the 100 500 pound gorilla now you know that that that thing has caused the problem this is getting ready to go and here's my problem i hear exactly what the paul says and i respect everything they say and the people that aren't even here that live across the pond on another block that are gonna have to look at las vegas you know south here i would vote for this but i want to hear the city manager who's going to control this sign speak into that mic and tell me that this thing's not going to blink this thing's i mean you got to regulate the temperature of it i get it it's the first night you might not have it perfect and everything but when that thing goes on if that's like i'm going to go there by their house and if it's lightening up their front room then it's no good we're going to turn it off i mean and if i have to call special counsel maybe we'll do that i mean i i want an assurance i want these folks to walk out that you know we're not going to be flashing it we're not going to be blinking and it's not going to be open all night it's not the diner you know what what can we do to assure them because i'll vote for it it goes against everything i believe in to vote for incomplete legislation but we gotta get this residential aspect done before somebody puts up another banner on their house so city manager are you ready to commit to that or can you commit to that um you know that this that we can allay their fears at least until we get around to this because i agree fred reilly this isn't going to be a one session um topic to go through digital it's a lot well there we're going to control the timing of it and that's that's why it hasn't come on yet we're getting some sensors uh when you say flashing it's not going to do this it is going to have roped you know scrolling which you would change anyway that's normal uh and we're not anticipating it's going to stay on online and uh you're not anticipating your own no we're not you're not on the go and when will you turn it off well we were we were figuring somewhere around 10 or 11 o'clock because that's our what when our knowledge is you know but but in any case we'll resolve that issue the other thing uh the the light throw that everybody keeps talking about we did a light meter study and did all that and the street light over there puts more light on the mall's home than this sign is going to put on their home or anybody across the pond and we'll continue to do those studies once the light is fully operational but at this point in time we've got a couple things we've got to add to it to be able to control it it's not going to have advertising on it well i guess you could say it is going to have advertising because it's going to advertise if there's a city council meeting or there's a christmas tree lighting or something like that but it's not it's not meant to be commercial it's mainly to put out give the residents city information and that's what it's for that was always the intent yeah i was going to say i mean mayor you're you're reacting in the same thing i'm sure you haven't been through the list of the best practices for the implementation of sonic we've addressed this at a meeting before and kyle and the city manager have that and that's what's going to be used to guide us in the implementation and the programming of the sign and i would i would recommend it all the council members i can't get a hold of a copy of that and take a look at it because i think it'll answer a lot of the questions and about a lot of the fears that we seem to have on this thing because a lot of these things have been addressed by other municipalities and bad actors out there who did it wrong and like i say i think it's incumbent upon us to take the high road in this and do it right if we want to do the sign ordinance let's let's touch it one time and do it right the first time and not keep parsing this thing out and kicking the can down the road if we're going to do it let's make it one smooth uh continuum thanks that's i like it okay thank you i'm gonna try and bring this to a conclusion we're coming up at 8 30 here um any other council comments that i'll give dave the last word if no one else no one else faith i have no other comments okay i'm going to call the question so for consideration first reading the mortgage 21-02 an ordinance of the city council of the city of

all commercial well commercial yes well it's going to be all difficult too i mean it's because i don't even remember anymore whether digital's coverage kind of homeowners stick digital in their house

one reefs uh some things that we've added just to highlight uh the electric bicycles which now we can restrict on the beach uh that's been added uh vice mayor gaddis had asked for some additional stuff for the docks and dwarfs we also added the time frame of 180 days 90 days and 180 days for various things such as uh fail to keep a vote in the marina and uh updated your comments from the last four sessions i think this is uh ready to move forward unless there's some other comments i'm going to direct one to fred riley i know fred loves this kind of stuff um because see fred here's the problem i was watching the world series last night and i fell asleep and i woke up at three o'clock and you know what i was thinking about does the state preempt any of this stuff with folks honest to god right so i'm looking and there's a state ordinance because apparently it's all over the place with how much a state how much is it a local or a local city can do not just in florida but even around the country okay so here we go with another can of worms to open up there is a state ordinance that speaks to this um and i can tell you what it is i actually have it on my phone if i if you want me to pull it up but i guess the question is is i know you've done the research on this thing we don't have to open this up like a constitutional discussion but are you comfortable not that it's bulletproof but are you comfortable that you're okay in taking the step that we're gonna take i'm sure the answer is yes but i just want to propose that question to you particularly since i saw this state statute well it's not clear in the state statute at three o'clock in the morning you should have been considering how could atlanta blow a 4-1 and that's that should have really been your question but um this this is based on section 316.206.51 and it has the definition and uncomfortable with it because i i'm typically going to be comfortable when the state law gives you a basis to regulate something and that that is what you're doing is you you have the authority from the legislature to implement this if you feel it is an appropriate measure for your community and i think the key was it has to be really liberal boards that's what they were really looking for you know if somebody was just fishing let's say for a few days that's not what they're looking for these are boats that are considered where you're really you know they have some they're they're out there they're people are living on them and it's a you know they as they call it as a cheap way to enjoy the nice cities and it's a lot of fun i don't have a waterfront property so i have no dog in the fight but you know when somebody parks their boat outside your uh you know two million dollar house it's not funny anymore so that's what this is all about yeah it's within the city's jurisdiction and that that you have a basis to regulate things within your jurisdiction i think this is sound any other council comments i gotta thank you uh page four who's going to determine whether these birds are wrecked or jumped i mean if it's wrecked it's going to have a damage or whatever like that but who's going to determine the lord's joke well that would too lynn and i were talking about that briefly related to something else but the the code officer of the city has to have a code provision to enforce and then they have to be enforcing the code provision in a good faith manner so the if there is something the rule of thumb that i would expect the code officer is going to apply is if there is something that presents a life safety issue then there's it basically becomes exigent circumstances and some action needs to be taken if it's something that is uh you know junk or dilapidated or whatever uh infirmity it has that could be a life safety issue but uh often would probably be more of an aesthetic issue yeah and on page six like this dots structures dangerous structures risk of a body injury um in writing that i looked at several different uh municipalities and this language came from clearwater who addressed it and they have the same issue you all have which is they have a lot of waterfront properties the the change i made uh that came up in the workshop was it it initially said any dot warf pile or etc or atc we took out etcetera and put in more structure so there was a specific thing um partial to it etc although that's what the clearwater ordinance says how how would you enforce this um you the code officer is typically not going on to somebody's property but if it's in the a structure that's on the water then you know it's a dilapidated dangerous structure and you can ride in a boat buy it and see that's what it is and i think the code officer has a basis for bringing a case uh based on what they can clearly see you know my my question is if it's falling into the water and it's beyond the comparative but if it looks like it has been painted hasn't been stained uh but the structure's still sound or we don't know the structure still sound i mean is that something that's disrepaired or is that something that needs to be repaired it might be not i see well it is but the language of it says uh falls into a state of disrepair and become and it becomes a dangerous structure creating an unreasonable risk of bodily injury to any person who may walk upon their own if if you can see there's boards missing and that's all different boards missing and boards ready to break are two different things but you can't tell the board's ready to break until you probably step on it well that's why i will go back to the code officer should be uh in good faith making a assessment of what is what's problematic and if it's a significant risk of unreasonable risk of bodily injury then they have the basis to bring the case if there's a you know minor thing that's wrong then they really shouldn't be bringing the case but that's you know they in enforcement you have to have some degree of discretion and then when it goes to a hearing you have to present the basis for why there's a violation and the magistrate is the one that ultimately decides whether they presented sufficient evidence or not to justify there being a violation okay lastly on page seven occupancy uh and these slips were within 180 days i'm correct yes so is this opening your door by telling because i guess about 50 percent of us live here full time and 50 don't so if you don't use your house in 180 days and i want to buy it like here [Music] the workshop the city council actually spent i would say a half an hour talking about what the appropriate times would be and this this is what they came up the council came up with i just as a point i mean i drove by there the other day just to see how many i think it was only one slip that was vacant um you know so everybody pretty much has a boat there this was the person who's basically parking and saying you know frank i know you tried to come in on this last one and it's a shame because we did talk about all this stuff but it's not your fault because for whatever reason that phone connection it was horrendous you know it didn't work but glenn guns as clear as a bell tonight so i don't know is like kind of like on a zoom call or is it just on a regular facetime facetime yeah maybe i should try that yeah but i mean we did go around and around on this and it was what we were trying to do is not somebody like you know particularly now i just heard of i was talking to somebody i'm gonna keep that person anonymous that they were saying take months to get a part for a car because there's none in the country same thing with these boats i think dave was saying there was like shortage of parts on some of them so we don't want to penalize the guy who really has a repair that's taking too long what we want us the whole intent behind this was the guy who buys the vote slip and doesn't even own a boat and says yeah i'm going to get one in six years and we've all got 40 people who really would love to have it so that was the whole intent it wasn't trying you know and i think there's a thing where they can if they're going on a 200-day cruise they talk to the city manager and he best be reasonable likes we expect that we have this discussion i mean if you're fortunate enough to go on a 200-day cruise we're not going to penalize you for that but you know if you're just for playing games that's what this intent was to get those people off that slip i just think it's government's far reaching into things they shouldn't be reaching uh council member banker just to clarify something as an example with the doc you heard a complaint about her doc tonight uh that resident allowed us to go on to his property to look at this dock uh it's in disrepair and we have a code hearing on it already scheduled for this month uh because we've kept talking to the uh i guess the fiduciary for the owner and we weren't getting anywhere with them so we're going to take it to the magistrate because the doc is in bad shape he explained that the doc was falling in the water too no it wasn't it's not falling in the was water it's it's got a lot of loose boards and it appears to be uh the cross members underneath it appear to be uh pretty much eaten up and and i personally talked to the fiduciary for the homeowner and told her i said if if you're not going to rebuild the dot then just remove the dot and you know she gave me the runaround about it so we're just going to take it to the magistrate it's that's and we went i went out with a vice mayor what six months ago maybe and we went out on the water we picked out people with sea walls or docks that were damaged and this that the other and we we stopped by and gave them notices and uh last month i think it was danny had 16 of the 17 notices for the dots it was all taken care of so it's just matter education i just have i've been contacted by people with docs um i've gone out to their house looked at them and they said you know they had currency calls by the code enforcement that um but the docs aren't used by anybody with them so i would not want to dabble in their personal business it's it's okay until until it does fall in the water and then it's everyone's problem and that's what we're trying to prevent what what point does it fall into the water well let me put it this way there was just a normal storm was it a tropical storm and i haven't been home this was several years ago and my son i was carrying him he's like mommy what's that i look out and there's literally an entire dog floating behind my house went under the little tiny 22nd bridge floated and then got jammed under somebody else's dock granted obviously a boater's not going to miss that but it probably did damage to another dock a boat so stuff like that dave can tell you they wash up by his house you see after a big storm you see pieces of docks that have fallen off of the boards they can ruin our docks they could ruin a boat go and buy so it is a hazard and i mean i've reported to lend some docs that i've seen where the boards are actually in the water just waiting for right now if it hasn't been painted or stained that's not a co-violation okay because you could say the same thing about somebody's house that hasn't been painted but it's about the ones that are obviously in disrepair not the ones that you have to go up and look at every single nail to see if it's you know at the right you know depth i'm talking about the ones that a nice gust of wind is going to start dislodging boards and then it becomes a problem so not the nitpicky looks look at everybody's and you know i don't like the color of that one but i'm talking about safety and to make it clear if if a code officer goes beyond the front of your house your sidewalk or in this case beyond that water anything they find is going to be inadmissible so and if i ever find out that a code officer goes on a property uninvited um we're going to have a special counsel to deal with that that is an illegal search and i will not i will not tolerate it and i would hope that no one else on this council will either um so you're not going to find a loose board okay but you know what i'm hearing that pieces of docker stuck underneath yours that one we should be able to catch and that one i think you know i was telling the young gentleman you know the supreme court case pornography we know it when we see it okay we know we'll tell you if there's a dock that's falling down but if we start getting to a fine point that oh you know i kind of noticed you got a screw that's too high that hey knock it off okay that's their private property but when the railings are falling down and the dock is half in the water and it's all rotted out and it's going to be a hazard in a couple of wind gusts then we have an issue i mean these things should stick okay that's the only thing that we're looking at we're not as an example uh there's a house right across the bridge on 22nd street uh there actually dave probably saw it because he lives close by there their whole lift fell into the water and uh you could see it and you know we had a uh complaint about it from someone across the water the other way and i mean you stand on emergency so if we get a complaint we contact the homeowner or the renter or whoever's there in most cases they'll take you back there and show it to you it's you know the only other way we would find out if there isn't a complaint uh if the house goes up for sale we we do a code and lean search to see if there's any violations and the homeowner gives us permission to go on that property and uh that's an option that they don't have i mean the lead search is usually mandated the inspection is a courtesy will do it for you if you want it's not required right but the sea wallet fell in if we wouldn't have done that and notified the owner that that seawall was going to fall who knows what would have happened but you know we notified the owner that they needed to repair that and they had a contractor lined up to do it but then we had three or four days of rain and the whole thing went in the water but so we were right you know i guess the point of this is don't overreach in fact we said that while we were doing this that i remember that comment coming up specifically this is this is a good ordinance as long as we're not overreaching if we get it's like every other organs we start getting silly on it which i don't think we will you know we should be fine i mean the one that's falling in the water we want dealt with before it falls in the water becomes a hazard it's a navigation okay any other council comments are you good with glenn there uh patty we're not going to play no questions okay citizens i just want to remind the council and i know that you guys are talking about them in that area generally i attend the city manager i gotten a complaint from a citizen over in that area where the council mentioned his council lives uh or a bunch of someone's dog flew up under someone else's brand new dog and they weren't worried about that this was a doctor and he was worried because someone had just got killed because they hit debris in the water so i i i totally support inspecting without violating anybody's rights but um you know when we think about somebody just got killed because of debris and water that's actually that's more something more to worry about than whether you know it's hitting in the docks so again our citizens are supposed to be our number one safety thing and i think if the city takes takes it from that point of view it's a safety issue opposed to hitting someone else's stock i i think we will be more safe thank you thank you any other citizen comments consideration of ordinance 21-10 an ordinance of the city council of the city of valor beach florida providing for

kept on file fighting for several ability providing for the repeal of all ordinances and conflict herewith and providing for an effective date this is the first reading madam clerk please call councilman otero hi councilmember aki aye councilmember baker it will move to a second reading with advertising in between madam clerk please advertise item 12 authorization of the city manager texas cued a purchase order for audio video upgrades in the council chamber contract with encore broadcasting solutions for microphone speakers and a new wiring configuration please have please not have a motion somebody so they've got a second segment listening tarot it's up for discussion dave i will refer to the city manager the manager yes mayor console uh we've done a lot of research on this we have some new wiring we've already put new wiring under the floor here kyle has kind of led this charge and i'd like him to come out if you've got any questions this is to upgrade the microphones the and to eventually get the audio visual zoom meetings and the cleaner situation in the context but speak right into that microphone because we won't be able to hear you with the present systems yeah kyle winkler uh community services administrator uh mayor and council uh we uh started this uh the first phase last budget cycle and we uh we started up wiring uh cad six cables by two floor locations um sending some back to the network room and then some over here to the sound system and um after uh you know getting uh the vice mayor's advice and working with encore broadcast solutions um we came up with a plan to flip out first and foremost uh all the microphones except for actually this pokemon mic um because of uh they thought this was the best solution um that we had because we're changing out the rest of them likes to these stick mics which pick up a lot better for the purposes of you guys sitting in front of the microphone without people around you um but by changing out all the mics rewiring the speaker wire putting in uh 12 speakers throughout so it's six pairs so 12 speakers which the way this this room is wired is uh the speakers are actually like an artificial like they look like drop down ceiling tiles but they're they're speakers so those are quite old at this point because they were original and um the encore broadcast solutions they're taking it was after that amount of time things just wear out so that's why we're going to require everybody but your speakers have any microphones and that should take care of all the the audio issues that we do have in this room um and then at the same time what we're doing from these new floor jacks is we're running everything through the cat6 cable as opposed to using some of these microphone wires that we do now so hopefully that's going to clean everything up um putting the uh cindy clark over that floor jack over there and then this probably will be over there so again [Music] adapted through the cat6 cable and it'll all come back into the sound room which will be wired with the new microphones and speakers and then at the same time they're going to get in a uh a hd video signal that's going to be wired through the from the podium that's going to be um take two cab 6 cable all the way to each monitor location and the projector so that in the future will allow us to upgrade our visual aspects of this room you know if we decide to we have monitored the capabilities of seeing people over the days here i mean we used to have monitors right in front of us which were kind of nice now we really like have to go down on the floor to see stuff um presently uh we're gonna keep the same monitoring system so it'll be like say we do a zoom call but the idea is that the computer that's at this podium will be the the main computer so when someone comes up to speed you'll see them it'll be fed through all the monitors so that you'll see who's talking at the same time so right now as far as a solution i guess i don't know how easy it is for you to see the screen [Music] it's back there you can see it but it's you know it is something nice if there was something you know up here you know around the circle or something that we all could i mean the best was when it was right in front of us because you had it right here and i could still be looking at this and listening to you and you know we can maintain eye contact and stuff but um um whenever we got the original quote it was much higher and it included replacing all of the sets in the room and uh we kicked it back and said you know let's just use what we've got for now so um although we don't have a way to see somebody and it's saying a zoom meeting or a presentation um my my thoughts initially were to hang a tv right there then we could just kind of glance up at that everyone would share but i think this phase allows everyone to be seen and will also give us the opportunity to uh to do zoom calls much better much more efficiently and i think that was our first priority was was just to make sure everyone could hear i mean this we had video capability here because there used to be monitors in front of each one of the seats here i imagine that wiring is still in here may not be cat 6 but why can't and it should be hard to work through this why can't we wind up i mean this big channel over here that nothing but pens and junk faults well i can't even if we're setting up something as simple as a computer monitor it doesn't have to be something sexy but have something right in front of us because we're going to have zoom and people who start sharing screens i mean we've said a lady coming here tonight presentation let's say she made that presentation on soon you know i want her to be able to share the screen with us all see it it's okay if we're all in the middle here but it may create some vision issues if you have something right in front of you everybody can see that and i'm just wondering i'm not saying no to this i think this is a great step forward but it to me i look at this channel in front of us which the audience can't see right now but there's a big channel here and we can even if it's uh even if it's not pretty even if we're just hardwiring some computer monitors and tying them into that station here it seems to have video in front of us here and would it be nice i'd like to see the speakers clearly [Music] yeah so as long as you're doing the zoom meeting and that presenter is typing it through sharing the screen [Music] um i have one other question for you probably kyle because we're taking the lead on this i know we looks like we work through the hillsborough schools contract and so have we i don't know if hillsboro actually bought any of this same equipment but i i hate to spend you know 35 000 and find out louder like these microphones are not as good we went to hillsborough and talked to them or have seen their system in action i have not but that's something i can do we we did go to bel air because they used the same and they they have strip speakers and we had that discussion and they felt that the uh not the speaker's microphones excuse me uh they felt that the ones that they're proposing would be much better for us and they've done all the work at bel air and uh their system's pretty robust what's the um what's the warranty guarantee that type of stuff on this is most county contracts are of this type there's some kind of warranty exactly but i would gather as at least 12 months i would i mean this is my feeling and i i hope the council will join me on this i'll pass this tonight yes for this but i want the stipulation that we have at least a 12 month warranty on this is a 35 000 purchase it's a major purchase for us um and and lynn i mean i i would approve it as is with that stipulation and if it's not that police come back to us and don't go forward with it that's that's me that's what i'm saying i need at least four other people to join me on three other people to join me on that yeah i would go along with that well okay that's standard in the industry yeah everybody okay with that i'm getting nods from from everyone leslie yeah you're good okay so we've got the majority at this point um so lyn i mean i that's that was my only concern so we're good good job with this and you can't get it now as can we get it in hopefully really quick okay good the team cancer and the wire are just starting to go let me see if there's any questions from the audience any one no okay uh anything that uh back on council do you have any last words have a question you got it okay so this is item 12 authorization for the city manager to execute a purchase order for audio video visual upgrades in the council chamber um they will do a contract with on-court broadcasting solutions for microphone speakers and new wiring the stipulation that this council has given you mysteries this passes is that it has at least a 12-month warranty you'll check that if it doesn't you will not proceed with this um if it passes okay with that you're not a yes okay um with that i can take a voice vote on this all in favor all right is anyone opposed i have six people left so six to zero pass is lit you go forward with it please and if there's a problem let us know okay kyle thank you item 13 is consideration of resolution 2021-11 a resolution of the city council of the city of baylor beach florida calling for a general election to be held on march 15 2022 for the purpose of electing three city council members and the mayor for

employees of the city of delaware beach florida and establishing their effective date this is for employee paid vacation day for cope at 19 surf uh service motion please second thank you dave i will refer to the city management city manager yes we did discuss this at the work session and what i mentioned is excuse me the city employees for the whole covet had all of them were vaccinated and numerous cities and counties are given stipends actually and days off for vacation and i will say that our city staff we didn't close one day during covenant ever we had city services every single day and the staff came to work every day and so the residents did not uh have any harm or some places closed their doors and things of that nature it's so unrecommended as an incentive to the employees just to give them this day off you know um i remember talking to you like when this thing just started and i remember saying one thing let's try and stay ahead of it because we have no idea what's coming and you just said something which sets us work from a lot of cities and we're a little city okay remember a plane gun quote there's condos that are bigger than us okay than our whole city okay and it's true there's condos that have 10 000 people in it but you didn't close one day okay that is a testament to our employees and i'm not about giving away free days and giving away rewards for showing up to work but this was something extraordinary i remember talking to you at one point saying we have no idea we might we had no idea if this was going to be like the plague and we'd have to close down sections of this we had no idea how bad this was going to be nobody knew okay and everybody came in there was no vaccines at the time and everybody came in in a risky situation it would have been easy for them to call in sick and just say hey forget it i'm not coming in um i support this 100 yeah there's a lot about our employees so you stood up for it yep and this was believe me this was one we're playing with death here this wasn't you know this wasn't a clue this was hard so any other comments and comments yeah i i have a problem in 19 i mean um i don't know if a lot of private businesses are giving a an extra day off i don't have a problem by giving the employees an extra day off i think they deserve it i mean especially these guys came in july during that tropical storm that was coming up and gave up their whole weekend they were out there standing i i would i would support wholeheartedly that any holiday falls on a thursday they automatically get friday in the future i think there's i think the whole stairs under pain to be honest but the problem is i have is with code at 19 right yeah it was a big scare and everything like that but now i don't know we're going to give them all they have to get their third shot their fourth shot their fifth shot their baby shot i don't know what a vaccine is anymore i never got a polio booster shot that's what i'm saying so i'm all for giving the employees a day off for more days but i just don't like the warning of the joke and i i admire our employees a whole lot of you and everyone lynn working on this but i do remember being briefed on this when we went to the seminar in the summer up in uh orlando and i think if i'm not mistaken correctly if i'm wrong can't we use the payment of this some of the money that we got from washington for this relief i think that isn't that to be used for incentives and stuff like that so you might be able to use you can you can do that but our staff's so small i i wouldn't the the accounting nightmare that that could create now you got a cpa firm yes it you know for the amount of money we're talking about it's it's negligible and because i've talked to other cities that are actually doing this oh yeah i got to do this i got to do that i got to have and we're uh six people small staff and we're not intending to uh try to create a bigger issue with the american rescue money we'd like to focus it on infrastructure and that's what we're going to discuss with the advisory committee and i think it's negligible really i just wanted to be considered as an option to utilize that money i mean you know there's 800 there so you know if we're looking to spend it we don't have to spend any last penny on the infrastructure because obviously we're probably going to go but um you know it's not a hard thing to come up with what the daily pay is for everybody well it's not so much that but it's as i understand it and and i've talked to a couple cities the reporting of spending that money for uh what i'll call other things and infrastructure or things of that nature that the reporting is is going to be uh pretty extensive to what i understand and we're not intending to hire a consultant to do it at this point so but a lot of cities are they're they're going out and hiring consultants to to monitor because of the uh reporting requirements any other council comments oh i'm sorry citizens back to council anything dave no i like this uh let's go for it got it consideration of resolution 2021-12 a resolution of the city council the city of valor beach florida providing for november 12th 2021 to be a paid vacation day for employees of the city of delaware beach florida and establishing an effective day and blue pay vacation day for covet 19 service madam clerk we please call for all councilmember motero i council member gunn councilmember banker aye councilmember aki i [Music] great job thank you very much thank you very much item 15 authorization to execute an interlocal agreement between pinellas county and npdes ms4 copernitis the florida department of environmental protection annual regulatory program in surveillance this is an aerolocal agreement that covers years 2022 through 2026 motion police ontario second second second date i will yeah this back to lynn and reece yeah mayor constant this is uh there are several co-permitees with the mpds program in pinellas county we happen to be one of them and this is a fee that they collect annually our contribution to this surveillance fee is 64.97 in 2021 so uh what i'm asking is uh for authorization for the mayor and city manager to execute this agreement representative finance committee i'm just playing with 64 bucks okay any other questions on the council so listen how much did we spend for the paper let me see riley and the videographer who are making the money right i spent more in review and paper than we did what we're going to have to pay there's no citizen comments back to council leslie any last words here okay authorization to execute item 15 authorization to execute an interlocal agreement between pinellas county and npdes ms4 co-permitties for the florida department of environmental protection annual regulatory program and surveillance fee i believe we can do this with a voice vote right now and clerk yes we can everybody in favor aye anyone opposed six to zero passes item 16 authorization to award a professional services contract for seawall and boat ramp design this is for design and engineering services for seawall and vote renovation this is for 7th street uh motion please shoot motion by frank banker and second second dave gaddis frank long time coming it's more than 7th street it's uh 7th street uh seawall boat ramp 16th street seawall and a short seawall out here along the circle where uh i'm sure all of you have been here to the water and you've seen the scouring and we're going to prevent that wash out so this is going to be the engineering concept i'm going to share this because i had a citizen ask me this so you and i have already spoken on this but i want to share there's no june is the only person left in the audience but they'll see it on the video give the citizens a rough timetable of the rebuilding of the 7th street dock and this whole engineering project and what we're looking at over here well i would i would anticipate the engineering will take us 30 to 60 days to come back from roo and then we'll put it out i'll come to the console and ask for authority to bid it and we'll we'll bid this probably all as one project we've got funding for the seawall we've got funding for the program so uh after we did that sometime after the first of the year and we had money for the dog also so yeah i want to lay the citizen spheres because there were some real theories people who owned boats there regularly and they said it's gone i'm like no the dock has gone temporarily oh that's a separate project right but when you told what you told me was that we could expect the dock probably around spring of 2022. that's that's her enough estimate so so the dock is coming back it's coming back bigger and better than ever hopefully or at least nice and um nice and sturdy and everything else when we do this there's some comments you know from the citizens and stuff regarding tide poles and dock construction and stuff like that so i just want to make sure that we make sure i mean i know we're going to do it in front of the citizens i just want to make sure that we highlight that because we have some very experienced voters in this area who use this and they can add certainly some input as to how it should be designed and stuff so they were explaining thai polls and they were like this if the old one was wrong and i'm like we gotta talk when the engineers are here right right okay all right but that's just a separate we're just this is just for the sea wall in the rain sea wall ramp and the sea wall at sixteenth and out here okay any sense of comments counsel this is going to change the look out there right yeah okay it's gonna improve that appearance and uh you know it'll have a raised cap and we'll kind of do some more landscaping behind it but that's a really a separate project are people still going to be able to swim and bathe we're just trying to protect because eventually with the scouring that keeps happening it's just going to keep coming closer and closer there's rock out there we have a bad storm that that rock isn't prohibiting anything the rod will still end up against it because it's a good protection for the sea wall but uh this this will at least stop that scouring basically from the bridge apron that's down below to the walk over that's that's where the biggest scouring is that was my only concern that people will still be able to enjoy because i do see a lot of people fish over there young you know you love do whatever they do all right um i'm going to call questions objections here uh authorization i'm 16 to award a professional services contract for seawall and boat ramp design again the explanation is design and engineering services for seawall and boat ramp renovation yes hope may move this forward we can do a voice vote all in favor aye aye aye one opposed six to zero move forward please oh that concludes our regular agenda we now go into any unfinished business is there any i'm hearing none i moved to the city attorney right up up this is numbered wrong okay so city attorney is actually 18 city manager is 19 city clerk is 20. city council is 21. item 17 is unfinished business that's completed by an 18 city attorney no report due to the late hour [Music] we've done a lot later on this it's been a long one city manager when you haven't had dinner you had this award well excuse me i'm mayor console i've got a few things uh we're going to bring the leo ordinance to have another discussion with the web session the whip the work session the bowie yes uh we've done some more research with the communities up and down the beach and uh i'll have probably some more before the recession which will be the 15th [Music] i gave you the annual report that we prepare every year in november kind of highlights what the staff has done over the year and as i mentioned earlier you know i just wanted to reiterate the staff it continued to provide services and they worked diligently to control costs and where we could increase any revenues they they worked hard at doing that and i think our fiscal year 2021 budget year uh a lot of things have improved not only with infrastructure taxes rentals uh parking fees a lot of those things have increased dramatically so the staff's done done a great job with that and we got through the crs verification visit and that was a positive we'll talk to the sheriff about the supplemental stuff and figure out something with that uh i think i said it but the role in agreement with that right council are you judgmental the supplemental sheriff's services leslie i weren't on council when we started that but we have some options we've set aside some money to use that the sheriff on special occasions for specialized direct control speeding things like that we don't announce it uh city manager works it out and surprise surprise you're doing 55 on the bridge and it's a bad weekend so um the fastest cars i see are the ones that are out at five in the morning that's whenever uh if you're a runner you're walking your dog you're trying to cross the intersection someone's going to get mowed down yeah it seems like to i mean you know and again i'm not going to give any hints but you know when we get to the weekends and stuff we can hear it you know particularly now that the windows are open they hit beller beach you know indian rocks is all lit up and then it looks like we're asleep here because we're residential they let it loose and you know and they're flying but i will say that it looks like you know that sign across the street which fellowship doesn't like by the way um because they've never told what was coming against um they uh but they said we like it though because it's it's it's making people slow down and i think it is making people slow down so that's a good thing but um they fly still you know up the other way and uh it's a little scary because and occasionally you will hear the sheriff racing afterwards yeah i think those those radar signs do help to some degree you're not going to stop everybody i mean i'll give you an example going down to boulevard last week one day with the code guy and i went out and spent the afternoon together in a city truck because i can't go in his car because we're not going to whatever speed he was wanting car goes out to the lane and passes but you know we didn't have to police cars there was no way to go but you know it's it happens and you ain't gonna prevail at all uh i just wanted to bring up uh last month you made a comment about the stormwater pond over there and i did contact the county uh just to see what they do because i know what they told me two or three years ago and they pretty much told me the same thing they're they have no intent of digging it out they do a uh inspection quarterly and i got them to provide me the last two inspections and really what they're looking for is silt in the structure that's across the street and they do remove that when they come for the inspection but i one thing additionally i asked him about is the fence i said either fix it or get rid of it because it's really not serving purpose and it's rusted now there would have to be something put along the structure which is uh almost directly across kind of at an angle across the street it's the concrete barrier the weir that the water flows into but they are looking into that so that's just to give you an update they're they're not interested in getting it out and i don't know did you talk to somebody specifically but these are really strong people so i just wanted to let you know that thanks for checking and uh that's all i have i can all get together on the board of adjustment training we did that last spring so that's not a big deal you know i had one thing i want you to just um i don't know whether it's even it may not even be our issue but at the 12th street eastman the house next to it which has had eternal construction okay apparently i heard a report it was told to me so i didn't see it i didn't get pictures but apparently they were blocking our easement pouring concrete at the house and then we went by the other day and there was combs in the street now i don't know whether those are undergrounding cones or they're the remnants of the sidewall cones but there happened to be a bicyclist in the bicyclist lane and that's where they put the cones in so now this bicyclist had to come over into the traffic lane which is now as we're hearing maybe a little narrower than it needs to be it's a mess and i'm like if they're doing this unilaterally that is a real problem it goes back to the sheriff enforcement nobody should be blocking anything on gulf boulevard in our town or in balor shore and that's a sheriff's thing but if they have permission or part of the underground i don't know so i said let me bring it up to you and just see what you are part of part of the work was underground the last couple days the last week and then one day they were pouring the apron to the driveway to the new home uh which you know they've got to have some kind of safety traffic control and they put the cones out there i don't there was no restriction to going to 12th street i mean you could turn in there but there was a cone before it would come afterwards i heard opposites i heard that the cement vehicles or the whatever is that mixer whatever they were using was blockheaded of course the person did not have their cell phone with them and i did not get a picture of it um i don't know and that that could have happened okay but i'm saying it wasn't preventing you know maybe there was a concrete temporary you know dumping this load of concrete well i don't know where he's gonna dump it unless he's in that i saw it and it was a mess between the the traffic the way the traffic flows right you know that sign that getting in the way and then they had construction and the the lane that everyone is supposed to now go into to go straight was blocked just it was sleep confusion right well that was when they were doing the drive i don't think it's been a problem with the underground people they're off the street and they're you know a spectrum who it is she was shooting the undergrounding project on that side of the street to get rid of the cross wires that was the one thing that happened anybody else any citizen questions from a city manager i i wanted to go back on that double turn lane that's something we really need to look into i purposely tried to stay in that lane coming here tonight and you just can't do it there's not enough room to make that left turn i don't know what the fix is but someone's we're going to have some bad pilots out there yeah i've talked to the county about a couple things already it may be that they need to shape the turn a little better it may be that their initial recommendation was to take that island out that's backed up so you can kind of slide over and get in that other lane the other question that's been brought up is it used to be when it was red left turn and there was no cars coming from the other way it was a leaky caution caution where you could make another turn those are questions that i've proposed to the camera i haven't gotta answer yet i hope they work out whatever you know problems we have because the the busy season is coming really soon and uh you know there's definitely some questions that have part of it i think too is it's it's new to people that's that's a little bit of a struggle i'm sure another issue with that is once you've turned on the causeway boulevard is there enough room for the guys in the right lane to merge and if there are a whole bunch of people coming in the right lane to merge into the left lane heading east is there enough distance there maybe two would that make sense [Music] it's going to require a lot of cooperation in an overly aggressive pinellas county for this to work out and i would say also my concern because i've tried out that lane to the new left lane and the concern is when you're taking a left the people come the opposite way taking a right are kind of used to going so that may have to be a no right on red well they haven't they have a red light right but we all know those are heels so a no right on red may have to be added there if we keep it just do that and glenn wants to speak so we get to him but if we do that you know last year was the first year of south of the bridge trying to go south of the bridge we live south of the bridge we were getting constant traffic on the weekends on our side which we used to never get that as they were going up to the light every weekend there was traffic so if we make that no turn on red um we may push it back to indian rocks i mean the county really it was yeah so if we go no right on reddit really but i hear you because now everybody's merging into the same piece well i think it's partially like i said there's some newness here uh and and even the county said you know we've got to give it some time and see how it works out and they're monitoring it and with their cameras and uh there seems to be two green lights in the straight lane and that's another question i'm asking because it looks like life or two there should to me just be one unless there's some reason for it i'm glad they studied this it's great glenn god has a question [Music] yeah i was just going to add money on that thing is you know i used it exclusively for the last three weeks after it put in i've had absolutely no problems it seems like the people making the right turn lane coming north on the board you were fine and i've had no problems emerging as a traffic in the first lane seemed to be very cooperative and i've always perished before i even got to the first street coming off of the southbound on where the cars were there i mean i've had no problems now the substantive feedback is just like a city manager said there's an extra green light there people are confused by it and the other thing i would add is we probably need to validate the turn radius on that dashed line for the center line it seems like it's very uh right angle instead of a curve there and i'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the turn rings for the large trucks that are turning off the build they're going to access the causeway i i think the uh the county looked at an error engineering rafter and fell into it so they obviously have some standards for merging there so i'm not quite sure that's an issue right along with the city manager i would say given some time because just like the sign says hey there's a new traffic pattern there and people aren't fully aware of it i think that the real azim test is going to come with the snowbird season and spring break so i think we really need to sit back and let lettuce evaluate it a little bit more and see what happens but it seems like the trend seems to be moving uh started officially through there and that's that needs to be the first step to be determined for me to start taking out the island uh further to the northern intersection and moving trees that's sort of thing with respect to the speed signs my question is is we've got new speed signs to the south and we've got the one that comes off of the bridge the question is have we collected any speed data from those signs yet because we just had a citizens complaint about excessive speed on the uh coming down the bridge here and uh we probably need to pull it down and take and see what we're actually seeing there as well as we always have the anecdotal complaints on the southbound uh gulf border so we probably need to take a look at that that kind of stuff right the county will get i just have to request it from them and they did give it to us for the southwest of the times and we found that it actually slowed the traffic uh and and i'm i'm thinking you know when i've been out on gulf boulevard and see people in front of you for the most part they're hitting their brakes and slowing down so uh we'll get some data from that the bridge i have two more points when you're done yeah i'm finished go ahead glenn yeah we talked about the special uh enforcement we paid for to have uh the officer sitting at the bottom of the bridge through error with our radar and we didn't see anything significant there and maybe it's time to put a speed box further up on the bridge and take a look at that stuff so that's that's one thing the second thing happened that we talked about some of the lawn services and the big delivery trucks parking in the center turn right there and i would just advise a cautionary make sure we truly understand the problem before we take action on it because a uh a consequence of that might be is if you insist on these large trailers and trucks pulling into private drives the service bill air shore imagine what it's going to be like when those trucks or trailers have to back out during the spring break where during snowbirds cease to entire traffic as they're trying to maneuver and stay in the parking lanes so um city clerk this is your time oh you're very welcome thank you great job enjoy the day off and um city council we start with leslie nateron claim gun how did he hurt me audio this past month they received our letter it wasn't received too well by one commissioner but the mayor seemed to uh thought it was a pretty generous offer i think um they didn't say but they're looking into it a little bit more aggressively they haven't shot it down um but your attorney i don't believe has all the facts with the fwc and that i wrote to patty um because i want one i got a citizen asked me about um the buoy changes in belarus beach which she says you know it was stated at the council that i'm against any votes coming into short i've never said i was against any votes coming into shore i was never against any buoy changes in belarus i still have i'm not against the greek changes in valor beach yet i'll get into it the next war section but i think what we need to and i would like to reach out to mayor schmidt and see if i could have a discussion with him if you have an email dressed home or not and do some clarification on all this frank i i listen to those meetings routinely as part of my um diligence for the suit and i heard everything they said about the boys and i know because of the sunshine thing i can't talk with you so now i can talk with you about it um it was fairly well received the person who doesn't receive it well doesn't receive anything well for us so i'm not i kind of discount that the one comment that i do remember hearing from their attorney they said maybe bellar beach doesn't realize how generous all of this was because they were coming up with some estimates of like a hundred thousand plus to do this and my first inkling was a hundred thousand dollars to sink a few buoys i mean if the state has made it this complicated well they're almost making a disincentive for safety and that is just against everything we stand for as a city it should be everything against this that they stand for i don't know if like you said she doesn't have the right information or do we shoot ourselves in the foot because when i heard a hundred thousand dollars i almost fell off a chair going wow did we just offer them a hundred thousand because that's a chunk of change um but i'm not saying no to it but i just want to make sure we know what we're getting into because they seem to think like wow thanks a lot this is really a great offer um we're only talking about two buoys right and i think and she was she was talking about replacing the ball yeah okay yeah okay and and to put in two buoys is probably gonna cost us after we buy the buoys and what have you uh somewhere around three thousand dollars well it's a big difference you know now there is going to be some cost for them to rewrite their ordinance because it'll have to be clear and i will i truly believe that bellaire shores put it put in a request right now for two permits with no wake zone and idle speed that permit would pass right now no it wouldn't well i'm telling you right now um not according to fish and wildlife well according to fish and wildlife when you go back a year ago they asked repeatedly what's going to be on the buoys and in the emails it changes with kyle said idle speed no wait three times this so the other towns aren't being attacked only ups um and we should we should have just remodified that permit back when i first bought it and i think it would have got passed easily but you know frank we've had lynn reeves go across i think go across across the street but really it's down the road here he's went to their meetings and spoke about underground and stuff like that um you are clearly the the most knowledgeable person that we have in this city on this on this buoys issue i have absolutely personally no issue whatsoever with you going across speaking with them speaking at their meeting um because i i sensed that they were open to it and if you read some of the actually some of the stuff that i've picked up in the discovery they were not for a little while ago so i think there's been some breakthrough over here and it is a safety issue and if if you know if it's three thousand dollars and they say yes i mean we're gonna vote on that real quickly because that's a no-brainer so i've talked to some of their residents and asked council to bring them back some of their commissioners actually addressed it i quote on them put on the record before that they would like to see them back and they actually used a scenario to use the pinellas pennies for canal is when it was already spent but all that said is i think it can be done easily if they get the correct information and i i'm not degrading your attorney or anything like that i just think there should be a i mean i mean and you know attorney to attorney we've had some battles and stuff like that with litigation but um she did a very i thought a very thorough explanation to that council so she put some time in on it again she may have some misinformation i have no problem with you reaching out to the mayor to the other council members but you certainly have my stamp of approval um any other council members how do we feel reach out to them and if they want you to speak at the meeting i mean you know you're not representing the council but you're getting the information to them you help clarify it and um if you can move it forward and you know yeah you know there's one person that has a little tougher cell than the other four but you know and he seemed to be waving a little bit towards the end too okay we're okay with that i think we you know before you do that frank at the work session we need to clarify what our wording is going to be and because we sent what we thought we had back up to the fwc and they gave us another rendition which fred and i so if they're immediately to it we just need to be able to make sure this will be what they're hurting is going to be we don't know what their city's going to i mean we know what we wanted you know when we were well it's going to probably have to be the same thing you know or something similar uh unfortunately i can tell you that one of the deciding votes over there talks about how he brings his paddle board out from his house he doesn't it's not a restriction in anything the issue is unfortunately [Music] based on my last conversation with fwc is we don't qualify to have an island no wake zone and unfortunately because of all this back and forth they're looking at us and so we have to come up with whatever zone it is and then change change our movies which that's my discussion on another night but uh yeah we'll have that discussion at the work session if everybody's okay with putting that back the only reason i'm saying though they're meeting we have our work session i think around the 15th they're usually their meetings around the 18th or something yeah that's who may have a better understanding once but he still want to get on the agenda for their meeting if you wanted to speak at the meeting yeah i would like to know the direction uh what what it is that we are deciding upon before you have that conversation so that we're on the same page i don't want them to agree to something and then we have to bend to match them if we're all going to have to do the same thing i don't think we all have to be the same we are two separate cities so well mayor you do because they don't qualify any more than we do to have like a higher my weight zone uh based on the statutes but they could let me give you a scenario they could have no like our first thing was no no vessels at all and we could have oh yeah yes so that's what i was talking about yeah i mean they don't qualify they don't qualify no matter what they do they're not going to qualify they're not going to qualify neither do we but they say no nothing which i don't think they will i think they're gonna go what we have they're gonna probably want manually propelled um you know paddle type things but um so i don't think it matters because they'll get their own choice really you know we could have two separate things we could right but what i'm saying is the i don't know weight is is out it's it's pretty much dead and talking to clear water they have no swim zone up to somewhere along north beach but beyond that there's no buoys no nothing you can do whatever you want that's pretty much private residents in therapy indian shores or indian rocks has no weight but nobody's brought that to the nwc's attention indian shores has no buoys they opted to get rid of and madeira has a swim area swim only no no wait zone so we're getting the information from the other cities so unfortunately we got attention but not the attention we wanted yeah because we don't have a lot we don't have a boat ramp uh let's see where else was there within 500 feet we don't have a fuel station all of that was was you know brought up to us when we set back what we thought we were going to do unfortunately but we're going to get the middle hustle zone down people still do it so i mean it's you know we've got four sheriffs vehicles four sheriff's votes in the whole county you know you take your choice i'm not telling anybody to break the law but you know people are going to chance it out yes yeah you're not you're not going to prevent it the difference is your chance that you hit somebody you got massive liability because now you're violating the the movies and have fun you know the person you hit below your boat so that'll be the end of that game frank i'm okay with you going right now but we have to vote on this let's make sure everybody's on the same page but because like they could do this different than us the states could ultimately tell them their limits and their limits would be the same as ours they're not going to get votes so i'm okay with it david i would like to know exactly what he's going to say and the reason why is because um it looks to me like uh approaching the fwc backfire i know it wasn't intentional but it does work well i didn't approach the fwc the city approached the fwc when i brought this to the attention of the city saying hey we got a safety issue here and i got residents complaining if we would have just gone to the fwc and said we need to amend the permit again because we removed too many buoys this thing wouldn't have been we've been done all right but we looked at trying to say keep the buoys out that's that's what this is that's when the fwc got their hair done okay yeah i think frank should get the call into the mayor get on their agenda we can certainly you know make sure we have talking points given to them um on the 15th you know that our our voices are heard the way we want to be hurt but i think he's got to start this ball rolling things move slower over there that they do here they don't have the staff like we do getting there he's you know law suicide he was a decent guy i was able to reach out with him many times in the past and um and i talked to him yeah his council shot him down and then we got into this so he tried so is he going to talk to the mayor now and then what are we doing i'd like to get it going on there at least and he comes back well if uh if it needs to be an agenda item you know i would say add it and we're going to have a work session right before that meeting so let's just kind of let's work on the game playing together the message you're going to deliver and uh i think right now we're wasting two weeks that's the only problem with that i think let's get better and you can talk to one but until you address the entire council you're not gaining any traction and and i i know bob also and [Music] he's he'll listen to you but he under the current circumstances doesn't give a whole lot back he's uh he's very very careful about his wording and what he says so i would just let him know that if you want to put an agenda item on there and you would like the opportunity to speak and then uh let's let's kind of do a review of what it is that you're going over to talk to because i don't want it to appear that it's prank banker i would like this council to know what it is that you're going to so how about if i just do this i i'll just go over and talk to him as a citizen you don't need our permission for that just say you're representing yourself but you're just getting some information i mean i think he'll give you the idea of the idea of the kicking if he could suddenly float you know no pun intended but he'll know what his council's feelings are and i think there's four people on that council that will go along you know county mayor schmidt would probably have four people you might have one problem is that one person is a very influential council member there so um so that's and that the extent that let's put it on our work session um and then come back to us maybe with some better insight and then we can say here's our city's position and he can convey that with that i'm good with that yeah i plan to put the buoy organs discussion of the ordinance we have a lot on this coming work session so i mean we still have some leftovers three other things the report the movie i don't remember we still have a letter that we're writing to better shore about [Music] the best practices for staff reporting on a discussion letter to the dollar short and then i have this so that's frank i'm still on you okay um [Music] i'm good okay uh guys no comment and um i don't have any comment either it's late we've had a nice meeting i enjoyed it we got a lot done next meeting is uh november 15th we have a city council work session at 6 00 p.m for these items patty what's the approximate deadline for getting anything on the agenda if anybody comes up with anything else [Music] probably tuesday because we didn't want to get it out on wednesday next tuesday basically okay all right all morning at school yesterday maybe we could just download a picture of that for everybody it's almost like your beach mat except it's more sturdy is it like a um like a foam or something or no no it's a actual like uh it's been around many many years my only concern and maybe this is something to look at beforehand we have a limited access on on morgan because of the cos and the dunes and stuff like that so how does we don't want everybody walking on it this supposed to be for you know people with disabilities and stuff so how do we work that into the existence well that's a wide opening there because that's where we go in for the beach renourishment okay so the opening is why i think they're i remember right there like three or four five probably four because is a wheelchair two different sizes on the website i don't know what they are though but i'll get you some pictures obviously i don't want to disturb the dune or cos or anything like that no it would have to go where the concrete pans right okay it might work and the price is right so great um all right i'll entertain a motion to adjourn second all in favor all right have a good night"
