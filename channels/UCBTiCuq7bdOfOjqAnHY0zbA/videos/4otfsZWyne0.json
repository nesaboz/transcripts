for the month of April there was 716 events in the month of April with 799 units responding majority of the calls were directed patrols traffic stops house checks contacts traffic control and illegally parked vehicles [Music] a total of five arrests made in April all misdemeanor charges primarily revolving around minor traffic infractions there were 140 citations or warnings issued which 23 of them were for parking and there were no crashes in the city in the month of April good sounds good anyone have any questions uh it seems like uh assaults were up in April were they uh I'm sorry assaults seemed like we had three questions falls under the domestics so they were like domestic quarrels or correct thank you foreign thank you all right next we'll have the code enforcement monthly report good evening Miss vice mayor uh city council member staff citizens Steve clap here for the record uh in my monthly code report uh again we are still doing some investigations as far as permits and unlicensed people uh doing work within the city a lot of them we have a uh we've been doing a lot with the cleanup around the city uh our major one which we've been working on for about a year is on 17th Street uh where the house was sold and the home was cleaned up um and now they're just waiting for a permit to do some work in there the other thing that we're doing is we're focusing on since hurricane season started uh with some of the docs within the city limits if I'm not mistaken we already got three letters going out and another three four um to get the homeowners to prepare their docks one that I'm very happy to say is was on Elita that has been going on since December 21st so when you see my report next month you'll see that uh they finally got a crew out there and they're replacing the dock so other than that I'll stand for any questions any questions yeah I saw him down here um unpainted uh worn out paint on house what about um citizens that say have pressure treated lumber unpainted um you know attached to the front of the house or around the side of the house uh is that one in particular um not right now just at just asking right at this point well again we'll look at that and I'll get with the city manager and also with Aaron to you know assess that but yeah if it's if the woods dilapidated deplorable or whatever then yes we can we can take care of that okay thanks any other questions I have a question regarding the docs how are we um monitoring them do are we using the sheriff's quote now or yes we are um I'm trying to go out at least once a month with them um and again it's it's scheduled change uh this Sunday I'm going to try to go out again because I'll be back out Sunday uh and I'm gonna go with one of the Marine units and just again start looking at some of these areas not only with the Docks but seeing if there's any other unscheduled work that's being done to some of these homes and this may or it may not be a question for you but if someone pulls a doc permit how long do they have to complete the project and uh that stands for like a full permit too because those seem to be open for I believe it's one year if I'm not mistaken the problem that they're having is getting these companies come in and do the work um because there's not a lot of Doc companies that people are using out here and um the issue is getting somebody to come out give an estimate and then find it out like we had the one on Elita we found out they weren't even licensed in this County so they had to get their licensing all together before they could do that so it's it's from the time they pull the permit I believe they have one year to get the work done and that's the same with a pool yes ma'am thank you you're very welcome also just to add that it doesn't leave the homeowner very responsibility so if the doc's under repair we have a storm come through you know the homeowner's still responsible even though the work's being done so we still have an issue with a little dangling so you know again it could easily be removed by the homeowner of things but um that's why I'm asking yes ma'am we've got that ongoing problem okay all right thank you have a good evening thank you any citizens comments questions okay thank you all right so item four is the presentation of the Pinellas Suncoast fire rescue District council members Jeffrey Davidson fire chief vanilla Suncoast uh this Thursday uh we are uh hosting a hurricane and water safety Expo uh right here and it's going to be from 1 to 6 p.m there will be uh vendors there's gonna be a life jacket giveaway Beach and boating safety information there'll be uh free barbecue there'll also be a blood drive and I believe if you don't eat blood you get a 20 gift card and a T-shirt and a wellness checkup and all kinds of I think it's gonna be a good day good informational session um and we expect anticipating hundreds of people to be here throughout the communities I know it's co-sponsored with ballet reach as well as Indian Rocks Beach so that's going to be a good day I look forward to seeing you there did you say it was wonderful it's from 1 to 6 p.m okay thank you yes ma'am I wanted to get the static guy on this microphone but so close can you all hear me okay just don't breathe on it use your hair I want to explain to the council and the citizens uh the EMS services that I have been pursuing for your city and provide you an update yes the enhancement that I requested to the county as its budget season uh to add an additional EMS unit service there you go good job Kyle that come on thank you this is great and there's an identified Gap that needs to be addressed I can tell you 100 I can show you we've had calls and cardiac arrest where we cannot get an ambulance for 40 minutes and that is absolutely unacceptable not in anybody's book especially mine Bel Air means alone okay not to the fire department to the County EMS fund Bellaire weeks alone paid 1 million 360 375 last year and you're not getting the services that that you deserve according to Pinellas County 2023 adopted annual operating capital budget the County EMS fund has approximately 66 million dollars in reserves and is projected to have 83.6 million dollars in reserves in fiscal year 28. almost 40 39.8 Reserves 83.6 million dollars and we're asking for one million dollars to fund two paramedics for an ALS transport unit that is desperately needed for this area your residents are paying accounting EMS tax and you're not being funded again the residence of this area were funded for one unit have paid in over two million dollars and we were only funded 689 thousand dollars EMS response time compliance is seven minutes and 30 seconds 90 of the time and I can tell you from EMS to this area selling meaning 88.61 of the time when it comes to all calls not just EMS it's in the sevens trying to fix that okay so a request was made for funding to staff and transport cable Rescue Unit and two paramedics to provide the EMS services that are needed into your city and this request was not moved forward by the EMS Authority it was not given to the board of County Commissioners I've asked three times for a written explanation as to why this demonstrated the was not considered unanswered so I'm urging you it's budget season I am urging you to please contact your County Administration as to why this request was not considered to be registered to the board of County Commission your citizens deserve it there's a gap in the system so it's been identified for since 2009 however many years that is a lot and this is the solution and the money's there so why is it not happening this is what I'm facing and I need your help okay if you have any questions we're we're off he's got a microphone over there if you speak loud enough I appreciate email BRC Badger and publish that email on our website so Association um you know I I left some of these uh on the table over there but I'll bring them up I have six copies for you that's the email addresses so the commissioner so you have to look a lot but this is this is you know I'm passionate about this this is what I do for a living I'm doing this for 35 years and this is no joke like if to see where we can't even get an ambulance at times 40 minutes to a cardiac arrest you're not surviving you're not surviving in in 10 minutes right so why are we here and why are our citizens here in this area paying over two million dollars and we're being funded for one unit there's a county resolution it's a resolution 09-37 that says EMS is closed zones which there are two here ps43 and ps44 which is Bel Air beats and Bel Air Source should have an EMS unit in it that was not even considered and I need your help you reference the EMS reporting this is sad questions EMS Authority is defined by the laws of Florida that were made in 1980 and amended in 1989 which designates Pinellas County as an EMS Authority this means they have a lot of decision-making power now there's a group efficiently The Authority is the board of County Commissioners but there is a group of a few people that made this decision and there was processes that were supposed to take place that were supposed to go to the EMS advisory Council which is why it's there they're supposed to make recommendations for funding and service levels and these decisions are already made and that meeting is not until June 23rd how does that happen when I asked for a request I asked please tell me how you came to these decisions I'd like to know your decision Matrix and what you used to establish that this was not worthy of being pushed forward to decision makers a week later I didn't get a response I emailed again I'm sorry I was busy I'll get back to you soon as I can just Friday third time three weeks later just a friendly reminder I'm waiting on a response you know this is not something that I take lightly um there would be a difference if service was being paid for and you were getting it right and of course there are some areas that help other areas financially that's the way it goes right you're paying for a service you have a demonstrated need for a service you can there's nowhere anywhere else in this entire County that there's 5.6 miles between fire stations and you've come to the beaches when you're only getting here by Bridge whether it be drawbridge or or big bridge or whatever pedestrian traffic and two-lane roads at 30 miles an hour we're not getting any more facts there's times where we can't even get to a call because don't Boulevard is shut down right if there's an accident if you need for example and we need other resources that they can't get there without coming a different route or sending different units so we have a geographical need you definitely have a geographic we are a Barrier Island right and there is a resolution by the county that needs to be considered so yes ma'am they might ask initiates that I might have been before recommending that he brought before them that would be before and whatever else exactly that would be the Department of Emergency and Safety Services you go on the website you'll see exactly the the people in that division who they are yes ma'am every story about attending election Commissioners meeting bringing some residents yes yes the next uh the actually the budget hearings which are not open for a public comment but those are the dates set out of June 14 15 16 21 22 and 23 but that's county-wide it hasn't decided what which one of those days is going to be for a few events but I'm absolutely going to be there absolutely and I've set meetings I've had three meetings with County commissions already and I'm going to continue to follow up I'm fighting very hard for for the services here for you and for your residents because not only do they deserve it but they're paying for it questions have any questions okay just just real quick if you get put together just like a little mini blow jar um so you you I'm assuming it's an online form Quest or is it simply not simple whether it's a letter uh it's that is your request and you send it to the group per person okay so if you could let us know in person whoever they are that would help I'll actually send you the actual request and then I did a request but then I had supplemental information that I wanted to particular ly do other supplements show this is a dire need um everywhere that doesn't work um as for City attorney report this is our first I think our last meeting happened just after the end of session I've given you a summary and I've since provided you some memoranda on um on enactments that specifically impact you both as elected officials and as a community and I continue to work with your city manager on um how the city will adapt to some of the more right more recent regulatory adoptions one bill we're still watching is Senate Bill 170 it was passed um to my knowledge not yet signed by the governor that was the bill that requires us to do economic impact statements with ordinances um and and also changes the landscape for legal challenges another similar one is Senate Bill 250 uh which in as a in in the follow-up to Hurricane Ian places some land use regulations and restrictions on communities uh within 100 miles um and and that's as I understand it as the crow flies from the point of impact for Hurricane Ian which was ke Acosta um about 98 of Pinellas County I believe Falls within that 100 mile range um there might be a slight sliver up by Tarpon but generally speaking that would capture this area um not yet signed by the governor either that bill makes it so that any land use regulations that are more restrictive may be nullified if they are adopted within two years of the date of Hurricane Ian's impact and that dates back to September 28 2022 so it would be retroactive um how how what is more restrictive is not to find fun things we may have to either litigate or defend against um whether here or in other communities otherwise uh your man your manager and I are quite literally in daily contact on um the various issues and action items going on in this County and I mean in this community and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have my pleasure thank you vice mayor uh starting off with our budget we're getting into the budget season on June 1st the property appraiser sent the estimate of taxable values for our city um so we plug those into the the budget that we've been drafting I sent out on Friday um the budget and I realized today that there's some parts of the capital projects fund um some pages that I need to get in there so I was planning on having uh planning on having uh the paper copy for you today but I need to get those supplemental Pages um and then I could provide that so I'm hoping to have it delivered um tomorrow so that we can get some one-on-one meetings um in the next two weeks before the budget Workshop which is on the 19th and uh yeah so we usually have a work session uh on the third uh Monday of the month that is our budget Workshop I wanted to uh get a consensus of what date we want to do a work session this month if we want to do it uh immediately after the workshop or if we'd like to push it to the next Monday um which would be the 26th of June I think we're currently at about five some different things have been covering um I know for one uh Emergency Management was on there with the marina which I'm going to bring up a little bit um but yeah oh uh some some Charter changes bringing that up as well so some important stuff for the work session so you think the work session the following Monday foreign so the workshops set on the 19th so the work session would have to be a different day [Music] if if but okay yes yes okay okay thank you next Golf Boulevard underground project again we have the locations of all the phase one which is south of Causeway Boulevard um we have all the locations of equipment figured out except for one which is right at the corner of Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard um Duke is wanting to have everything set before we put start piping the conduit through um the underground Consultants of Florida is continuing to ask to get started on this project so we're we're trying to keep get it moving uh again we're kind of getting held up by Duke engineering but we keep pressing through our progress reports uh the stormwater Improvement projects we the survey uh is underway uh by George Shimp and Associates um they are collecting the survey for each of the project area and streets um they were just down here on 9th Avenue or 9th Street recently um as they get the streets surveyed they're sending it over to the engineer so we're not waiting for it all to get done we're good getting it over and then he's starting to design so once he once he starts getting some preliminary designs together um I'd like him to cut come in and present them and to the council for questions the marina dock renovation we went out to bid um for the uh the replacement of the pilings and the cleaning and wrapping of the ones that didn't need to be replaced the project only got one uh steel bid and that was uh for 75 000 it came out much higher than expected um currently we have 52 000 saved for dock improvements in the marina fund um being that such a chunk of uh of uh expense I'd like to bring it to the work session to discuss um some other options because it you know it is a significant amount of money and maybe the way we end up deciding to go or we might want to look at doing more um at a later date where we accumulate more money um to make sense of where our what our vision for the marina is so I just wanted to to discuss that in the work session um we just recently got um it's a small amount but uh close to five thousand dollars back for our uh um our sandbagging efforts for Ian so we got some money back cover some of our expense so took a little bit but I'm happy to say we got the check um the uh we put some five bar in over there at the at the playground so that's uh uh looking nice and and wrapped up the uh while I was out there I it brought back to my mind that there's a boardwalk over overlock that goes from Bayside um down to a little Beach area um it's it's getting in a um just deteriorated condition uh my thoughts on it are it's not even necessary to have um I would recommend removing it um because I don't think it's worthwhile to replace I don't know how how anyone feels about that there's an observation uh yeah and we've you know that's still in good condition um this one is much older um what it does is it walks out um to to the sand area and then it steps down but it's you know rental of this yourself foreign sure my gut feeling is no um just because the condition it's been in and I and um citizens have made comment about its deteriorated condition so I would say no um I can check on that uh I feel you know you take it out you still have a passageway down to the beach um I can't see any uh other means of it being there are reasons that should be there yeah take a take a look thank you very much I'd like to hear if there's any feedback from anyone if they think what they think about it it seems to me that if you don't try to prescribe people are just do direct traffic I'm sorry man just for the record would you mind stating your name and address thank you for your comments thank you so that we'll put it put it aside and look at it down the road just wanted to kind of throw that out there okay okay um the next council meeting is on July 3rd Monday um July 4th is Tuesday I want to check if we want to keep it on that date or consider moving it being the holiday weekend if you have something um okay thank you um yes okay that's all I have said yes I had three contractors yes we had one that submitted it wasn't a sealed it was a sealed estimate for a total remodel but it didn't count in our bid because it wasn't done correctly but we did get something else turned in all right thanks for each rate I think it's it's three times or after a storm that washes a lot of seaweeds what were permitted um years yeah currently we we drag it we drag it down to the water where the water takes it again like it would the tide so it's an annual thing it's in February you apply electronically to the state um like I said we put in for uh triannually and after major storms um I have the dates that we've ranked this year I keep track of them um I it would I can check with them what's required to up the frequency yes yes yeah and now that we don't have very much Beach it goes pretty quickly so but does make a difference yeah um so yeah let me start with the state to find out if we wanted to increase if if it could be done you know halfway through the year here so approximately okay so like right now I would say a couple hours back when we had nourishment and we had a big beach you know it would take almost a whole day um she just you just had a lot more sand and we got to be down to maybe 15 of what was there we start with Bellaire Beach um but yeah they work down the LR Shore at the time that we rake okay [Music] is going to meet on June 14th to review Attorney Morris draft time okay today [Music] foreign vice mayor one moment please this is ordinance 23-03 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending the city of Bellaire Beach Comprehensive plan pursuant to the evaluation and Appraisal process of section 163.319 Florida Statutes and the amendment process of sections 163.3184 Florida Statutes adopting new goals objectives and policies and Maps as presented here and Below providing for a copy to be kept on file providing for severability providing for the repeal of all ordinances and conflict here with and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of ordinance 23-03 on first reading by title only motion member Notaro motioned member Livingstone secondary sorry I wasn't going to be a presentation yes yeah so with with that we're prepared to go to staff presentation everyone turn off their mics and I'm going to try and turn this one on thank you I'm a low Talker by Nature so I appreciate this he's getting the micro and I'm just trying to get the speakers going foreign thank you um so uh good evening it's it's nice to be here um my name is Linda Fisher I work for forward Pinellas um you probably know us best as the countywide agency that coordinates Transportation Planning we also work with land use but wearing another hat we also provide technical assistance to local governments in particular we do a lot of comprehensive plan updates so that's the Hat I'm wearing today I'm here to help you update your comp plan um just as a reminder the purpose of the comprehensive plan is to provide a policy basis for the regulations that the city adopts and the decisions that you make in particular it governs land use the plan establishes a set of future land use categories that establish where different land uses can go in the city and how densely the land can be developed from the state's perspective the purpose of the comprehensive plan is to help regulate the growth of your community but for a stable community like yours the purpose is really to maintain the quality of life that you have you do need to update your comp plan every seven years to make sure that your policies are still current and to stay up to date with any changes to state law you also have to update the maps and data that support your plan and any terminology or references that change over time and this is also your opportunity to add or update any local policy priorities as you see fit and there's a defined process the draft amendments need to be reviewed by your designated local planning agency which in your case is your Planning and Zoning Board your board has done that they held a public hearing on May 8th and voted to recommend that the city council approve the draft that's in front of you and now it's your turn to review and consider the draft amendments um so this is the first of two public hearings that you're required to hold for this process if you vote to approve the Amendments then the next step will be to transmit them to the state for review and I'll talk more about that later in the process for the presentation but first let's take a step back and talk about what's in this draft what would be changing from your current comprehensive plan well the first and most important group of amendments are to address three new state laws that have been passed since you last updated your plan the first is What's called the Peril of flood Act passed in 2015. and it requires you to adopt strategies that address the risks of flooding hurricanes and sea level rise in their specific language that you need to adopt so the draft amendments include a number of new objectives and policies to address the new law however you're a Beach Community so you've been addressing these issues forever you already do this so it's really just a matter of spelling out what kind of strategies you already practice you follow State Coastal Construction codes and Coastal setback requirements and FEMA floodplain management regulations you participate in the National flood insurance program and so forth so all I did in this draft was take the things you already do and put it in your in your draft plan another new law that was passed last year is called the private property rights act this law is really largely symbolic it requires you to adopt a new private property rights element in your comprehensive plan and the statute provides a specific language addressing what people are legally allowed to do with their land it requires you to respect judicially acknowledged and constitutionally protected private property rights in other words it's acknowledging rights that already exist it's not creating new rights those existing rights state that the government cannot take a person's land and that a property owner has the right to use and control their land but it is subject to state law and local ordinances so uh and that includes your comprehensive plan and your zoning code so it's also acknowledging your right as a city to practice reasonable land regulation the last of the new laws is one that doesn't have an immediate impact on the city but I included it for due diligence in case it should apply in the future it's called the live local act and it was just signed back in March it allows certain affordable housing developments to override some local comprehensive plan and zoning regulations it only applies to land zoned for commercial industrial and mixed use which you don't currently have in the city but I drafted a policy that just acknowledges that the law exists that way if you're if your land designations could change should change in the future or if the state law changes in a way to make it apply to the city then you're not in conflict as noted on the slide I do need to correct a statutory reference in the policy I inadvertently referenced an identical statute that applies to counties so I just need to update that to the one that governs cities do you have any questions so far about these these three laws okay thank you so those are the minimum policy amendments that need to be included in your plan now your Planning and Zoning Board held a series of meetings between January and may to review the draft plan and I want to commend your board for being very engaged and thoughtful throughout the entire process not every city has that so they were a pleasure to work with they did a technical review of the draft plan and they also voted to make some recommendations to you for updated policy priorities highest priority issue that they identified is the high volume of traffic that passes through the city due to higher density Redevelopment and tourism from your neighboring communities well that's not a problem that we can solve with a comprehensive Plan update this is your place to identify actions that you take that you could take that might help and that includes things like using the forward Pinellas Forum to work uh directly with those other local governments in Pinellas County for example you could explore whether there are options for Traffic Control measures either technological or law enforcement that could make it easier for your residents to exit from their local streets on the Gulf Boulevard and it would also be a means to seek funding to pay for those measures we also talked about making sure forward Pinellas has accurate data that takes into account that your Rush Hour patterns are different from the mainland yours are driven by tourism not nine to five commuters and we can't use the same one-size-fits-all approach that we use for the rest of the county the board recommends that the city consider designating a specific representative or even a committee to reach out and work with Ford Pinellas to um to work toward addressing these issues the next issue that the board identified was the importance of the Bellaire Beach Marina your current plan has a policy providing for the potential Redevelopment of the marina with residential uses in the future and the board recommends deleting that policy and replacing it with others that recognize the Marina's importance to the city to declare that the the city desires to keep the marina as a Marina and to prioritize it as much as possible for the enjoyment of City residents and then the last major group of recommended policy editions uh concerns cost savings and additional funding sources through things like seeking Grants State and local transportation funding and even potentially the use of renewable resources like something like solar panels so those are the Planning and Zoning Board recommendations so now it is the council's decision whether to accept those recommendations or to make any further changes to the draft amendments if you vote to approve the draft at this first hearing then two things happen next the document will need to be transmitted to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity which is the state agency charged with reviewing comp plan amendments and copies will need to be sent to a number of other state and Regional agencies and the local governments that are immediately adjacent to you who will all have the option to weigh in my experience is that virtually none of those people will actually weigh in but they have 30 days to do it and then overlapping that same time period Deo has 60 days to review the plan once they are done with their review they will issue what's called an objections recommendations and comments report or report and if they feel that anything that you've proposed doesn't meet state law or needs a technical review then they'll let you know typically we get one or two very minor comments just wanting us to update citations or clarify something so that's usually not not an ordeal the city has 180 days to respond to the orc again I don't think it will take that long once you make changes then you hold a second public hearing to officially adopt the updated comprehensive plan it goes back to Deo they have another 45 days to review and unless there is a citizen challenge then it becomes it becomes effective as soon as they issue their notice that that they found it compliant so there is a built-in process where citizens can challenge or comp plan update but I've been doing this for 25 years and I have literally never seen it happen so I don't think that's a big risk and that is your comprehensive Plan update process if there are any questions I'll be happy to answer them no okay thank you okay so we have a motion and a second on the floor are there um any citizens comments citizens have any questions or comments okay Patty do we need to do a roll call vote on this okay office please yes yes hi okay ordinance 23-03 passes um moving on to item 11 consideration of

business no okay city council comments last thing we'll start with you and just run down the line I just want to thank Kimberly Shaw Elliott appreciate your service uh um last month I was discussing about the fun Insurance problems and when insurance and I was put on the flood mitigation board I attended my first meeting this past month was mostly about flood risks getting information out to surrounding communities that are involved portion of the surge which surges and how it occurs and where it starts and uh the risk of flooding and flood insurance companies leave in the state um I've also been in contact as I noted the senator Scott's office since late last year regarding FEMA 2.0 I was under the impression that Ian was going to impact this area even though it didn't impact this air with flood costs which it is just got notified today that another private insurer flood risk is leaving the state so they're all telling us to go to nfip Senator Scott is trying to introduce legislation this month to get more private insurers back into the market our state senators did the same thing last December With the Wind insurance which caused nothing but a mess these problems really aren't that hard to resolve back in 1900 there was a town a little bit West in West Galveston the experienced the cat fight or hurricane wiped out the whole town leveling two years later they built a three-mile sea wall extended it over the years to 10 miles God see Walters from anywhere for I think 15 feet to five feet I'm not saying we need a 17 foot sea wall but we should be investing our money because Ian's Ian costs the federal government four billion dollars just for that one storm so I went to Center this guy he said why don't we take that money and invested in storm drainage catch basins pumps sea walls instead of just pumping out money to repair these homes that get washed away every year and whatever like that well I don't know if that would resonate to the taxpayers but we can just keep spending cash foolishly in my opinion that isn't going to prevent anything um so sadly today I was finally given information because I've been after this 2.0 just give my constituents your constituents Mr Scott some explanation on where the city discount of 20 we received along with somebody submitting an elevation certificate and the adjacent grade now adjacent grade is the bottom grade of the ground okay so your street is true generally the adjacent great take a show on your yard dig down you'll find sand about a foot down okay so that dirt wasn't here originally it came in when they built the houses so you'd have grass and everything like that anyway no one can show me where those adjacent grade discounts are so now I was given a Laya sign but I was told to fill out a form uh what was it called today this is just more I can see why Chief Davidson gets so upset with the government um it was it was informed so I can Privacy Act consent formula is called so I feel like I'm just going back around in this Merry-Go-Round Circle wow I don't know I guess the right word is while the resonance here get screwed so but the other thing I wanted to mention was I visited Morgan Park Saturday Memorial Day weekend and Sunday and I know we got a lot of flack about raising the rates there wasn't one parking spot open from 11 o'clock yep thank you Mr zagel nothing nothing okay uh nothing from me either but thank you all for coming out and joining us for the meeting tonight and uh have a good week um do I have a motion to close second all in favor thank you thank you thank you foreign"
