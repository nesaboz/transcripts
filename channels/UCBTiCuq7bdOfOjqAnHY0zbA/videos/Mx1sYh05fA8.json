the first time this has happened um why don't we just move right on over them to the monthly code enforcement report and thank you thank you for being here yes sir thank you Commissioners mayor of Civilian officials Mr President Steve Cloud pick for the record as you see in front of you the monthly report by code enforcement you'll notice that our weed and grass and overgrowth has raised a little bit but we are taking care of that and our impermanent work has dropped happy to see that it's down to 7.5 out of a percent out of the circle there uh been doing a lot of follow-up working with a lot of the residents on the overgrowth of weeds and instructions on the roadways I've been in contact with the city manager also meeting guide instruction to help go along with that we still have a few problems along the boulevard that we are working with and do the Duke Energy contract trying to get together on utilities other than that that's it for my report I'll stand for any questions Council if you have any questions for the day thank you very much thank you I appreciate you hey YouTube um while we are discussing uh the police of the police report I do have a question for the city manager do you what do you know what the current procedure is for parking and creation this is where I'm going what I've noticed is that settling the bridges and the shoreline anywhere where there's non-homes has become free fishing and I have yet to see anyone Patrol and and I've I've actually rolled down my window and said hey you might want to you might want to reconsider doing that because they do patrol around here you can work an hour later and they're not leaving Mr verify the address that on the fourth I was out I didn't catch several people uh out on the bridges they were parked and told me they couldn't be there you can't park there one of them was up on Harrison we had to move over to the marina as far as part of fishing on the bridge there's not really much we can do about that because it's considered open Waters but if if somebody parks on the roadway I get an opportunity to move if they don't but we're going to sign them and move them anyway this is one individual that was part of Harrison went to the marina didn't pay ended up getting a 55 fine anyway so um but I am I am monitoring any type of street parking like that for anybody who is not doing any type of work in a residential areas okay and just for clarification I don't have a problem HD parking at the entry or exits on no search and it's happening constantly I'm wondering if you see it in your neighborhood also you see it's so long Harrison but I know uh I know someone's adopted produce that so they were parked at Laura Park areas or you know where they can fish offset here and they were primarily so I know that the sheriff is doing their job when it comes to that but you know along with that I think I'm going to Bear Camp out here majorities but also at Bayside Park to it and writing a lot of citations out there for the same thing where they're just quality they're not paying and they're going out and fishing along the coast here all right and um is there a better number of them a permanently owned whole phone line um what I can do is I will get uh Joe and David's cell phone numbers so we can we call them directly because they they do not mind having that happen and they just have coconut when it does happen say exactly and giving out my cell phone number so if there is an issue I will go check on it um but I will address this with Sergeant shiver to make sure that we get it on the line to make sure I appreciate it thank you very much yes sir any other questions or comments um all right let's make a varietal to item number four is Davidson here tonight presenting for the vanilla Suncoast fire and the rest of the price key District number five a presentation before I call Mr Davis to the podium it's important to know why he is receiving this award since 2000 and possibly earlier Rudy has served Bellaire beach in various capacities including serving on the steering committee that made recommendations to the council to replace our aging City Hall he served on the citizens advisory committee they worked closely with Pinellas County to agree on the design of the Bel Air Causeway Bridge he served as president of the Bel Air Beach resident group that form a pact and brought the council manager form of government to referendum he served as the first mayor of Miller Beach in the new Council manager form of government during that term the council elected to move forward with the construction of our community center he served as a member of the board of adjustments he served on not one but two city manager search committees he also served as Vice chair of the Planning and Zoning Board I could keep going but I'm pretty sure that everyone here gets my employee now I'd like Rudy Davis to join me after coding Mr Davis on behalf City I am honored to give you this distinguished service and we are very proud of all your accomplishments thank you very much thank you thank you prayer goddess final four members of City staff I sincerely appreciate this recognition of my service to the city of Bel Air Conditioning it has been my pleasure and privilege over the years to work with so many dedicated residents who shared my love with this community and the desired that to maintain the unique character the lifestyle that we enjoy while working on various committees or to special projects over the years some of the most satisfying confluences accomplishments I've been serving as the president of their father of his residence group is hard work practical manager for governor for referendum the subsequent approval by the voters of our city serving as many are doing the transition into this secure profession that's more professional form of government and continues to serve us throughout the day and most recently through help organize the campaign to defeat the mayor who would be king uh what would you felt like the 73 years of Valor Beach council members before me that service to our city was fully compensated for by the opportunity to maintain and protect what we had within this law organizing community and I never wanted a salad where you couldn't work I mean maybe if I were here for the money I was here for the wrong reason because I think behind public service to attend other matters or require my full attention I do want to alert our residents to what our city council to already knows there's a serious challenge that Belair meets in all cities in Florida if I preparing Florida legislature and Tallahassee their objective is to take away a local municipalities ability to control what happens within its own borders and take that power to Tallahassee to make and serve the winning special interests who don't want you and need telling them what they can't do in our town rename compress them through either change their views and support public or face removal from office by local voters who put them there mayor and Council should take a very proactive stance for retain your authority of local matters and our residents report their support their evidence to do so for Tallahassee we will soon take that right away from us we should all actively support the local the local voices United project sponsored by the Florida League of cities I asked Council to make sure every resident is aware of the project and how it sorts supports our right to self-determination mayor council the city staff I thank you again for this recognition they wish you and all the progressives of power reach the very best thank you thank you all right we are on to item number six which is quarterly more birthdays let's begin with the board of adjustments report from Mr Mike Kelly Mr Kelly you have before thank you Mr Mayor I appreciate the opportunity to tell you that the board of adjustment has been busy before we adjusted normally only sees two or three variances a year we've had two this quarter and we're supposed to have one this Thursday but we postpone it so we have active board we've had the same three kind of cases that have come before us regarding pools Council sort of get a plan to make that get me viewed and I'm sure everything will work out just fine but again an active board we're getting a lot of experience for the new members and if there's any questions I'll be headed to Hamilton this time thank you Mr Kelly do we have any questions or comments I think you guys are doing a great job and I'm hoping we can't get this forward absolutely so thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen all right man we are on to the citizens advisory committee report for Mr Ron scanning thank you mayor council uh citizens advisory committee at this past quarter under our other title as the audit committee and we approve the Bible comprehensive annual financial report on May 3rd and it is the council approvement and they picked some errors of all the reports that were missing so I will be meeting later this week to review the budget and that's what we've done thank you do we have any questions thank you again all right next up is the Park and Recreation report from again um just a couple things from the parking record once again I'd like to thank all of our between our volunteers over the last quarter we are looking at new items to put Valor Beach logo then I like the table class but um so if anybody has any suggestions please contact anyone on the park and ride order please call We are continuing our new welcome back program for new residents along with all the necessary information that they need as new residents um they also we also include some Bella Beach goodies and some local version info if you as a resident own a local business would like to contribute something to the bag please drop off at the city hall matches of 10. the UC City website or our e-sign for upcoming fall and spring events our third annual health and wellness fair is in January and we would love to have more resin participation as vendors if you're in the health and wellness field anymore but um yeah that's great I don't I know like there's a schedule that the city maintenance team has to to rape the beach are you looking for the parking rank to maybe get volunteers to do that I'll borrow too but I don't know about somebody getting hurt or I'll drive the track now I did I did contact the fdp and we had an auto permit and they said that we can't really get more frequency with the turtle season you know and sometimes you know during the busy season we 've done the turtles are clear on the beach people out there so you kind of can't get involved to get around them how frequently we'd like to do it um limitations for volunteers would be I know would you rate if you've got a dump anything to take away waste of exactly can we put resonance in those systems equipment you don't want to be doing that but there are no insurance coverage right you want yours that's what I thought it to me it seems like it would be difficult because we don't always know when the beach needs to be raped just based on when there's like something like a big a lot of food coming in out of the water so like you know I know it's scheduled but if I don't know we can have maybe something I don't call but like that we could do through the city without trying to get groups of volunteers because we can't always do that on short notes anyway we have to sign a waiver Hardware but uh music we used to do this regularly I don't think it was on a regular scale why did we stop um the last two times we did it when the weeds were accumulating on the beach since I've been here since 18 uh our permits been filled out for triangularly and after major storms so um typically what happens is a resident will report able schedule any other questions or comments thank you all right and finally we have the Planning and Zoning report from Mr jcm Mr Mayor vice mayor council members 3221 East representative the zoning board has mastered several times since the first of the year it's not important it just sits and looks around sometimes we look around and wonder why we got certain things but we got the comp plan and just as a for instance we spent four meetings and return it to the council until about five hours two two one and one and this is times that the citizens are both and we presented that back to the city and recently we were presented an ordinance considering signs and it's only this thing and when you go through this I'm wondering whether it belongs with a zoning board because most of it I have through college degrees but one of them is at law and most of these presentations early beliefs and we're not attorneys and I would like to ask the council to reconsider putting this towards the board for our consideration because when it was first reviewed by us there were a ton of questions someone know the answers to but the the near flights on the board did not understand a lot of the verbage so I don't believe that belongs to it I'm bored it was referred back to the attorneys we proceed from there I'd like to thank Patty for helping us out quite attention and the city manager is always there and Randy and we're a silent board but we do get our job done and we know that the city and all you people do a good job too and the people behind me that show up they do a big job and I lost some averages and they didn't die but they might as well Rudy ran away from me this year about the big hole in on the right side of me we have been on boards together for the last 28 years and then another person resigned and we got new ones they are not familiar but we keep trucking along to get our reports but some of these things should be reviewed before they're Dunked On Us are there any questions that any lovely people have I uh I would like to make a comment first and I think that there was probably a little bit of miscommunication of what we were looking for from Planning and Zoning we certainly I hope I'm speaking for the entire Council we're certainly we weren't looking for legal advice and unfortunately I'm afraid that that's what was interpreted whenever it made made its way to Planning and Zoning we received numbers that were highlighted and it was it was our job to kind of look through it and make some recommendations pitch into planning and zoning and see if you agree you and your the other members agreed I don't know how we went down this rabbit hole but that I don't think that's what we were looking for I do appreciate your effort and your time and I I apologize on behalf of the council for the miscommunication I think maybe the next time we pitch something to any one of these uh boards or committees we need to make sure that it's clear and fully understood as what we expect with any council member like to make a call what I just discuss I sympathize with you with that side note so I was hoping counselor throw it in the trash I think we went from six six items to 40 pages in that new sign organs um Justice painting I don't want to Discord but she says this will come back to court one day all right when they got some alarms from residents but I think the Old Law uh an old city manager handled it Mars beautiful Whenever there was a problem this man right here I think has the same ability to handle it I think we should trash it but sympathizing the whole door to even address it thank you very much I am I'm I'm not going to waste Mr trash time to try to explain why as things have changed over time that we have to become more uh protective of our liabilities and I think that that was the original reasoning for even altering our sign policy all the way around uh again on behalf of the council I apologize for apologies not necessary it's just a matter of communications everything's accepted you have your job we have ours and I appreciate it I I do have a question for you uh now that we know what the actual task is uh does uh Planning and Zoning have enough energy to review a copy that has the numbers that we that we inserted showing distances thicknesses Heights because it's not it's not terrible but I would feel like a second opinion I understand I'm looking for a yes or no I didn't quite understand the question you don't know I would like to I would like to meet you back to you again but this time highlight every number where it's feet inches so that you have something tangible to look at instead of Legally speaking if it's shorter than 45 pages it will be 45 pages but all you have to do is look for the yellow where it's highlighted down it should be pretty straightforward and if we put little marks on the side of saying something that each translations I think we can handle that we okay we were just looking for another group of citizens absolutely so that we can say that the council did not dictate safe size height with weight Etc that's what I tried to say if you're nervous of what we came up with half well more than half 95 of this was passed by the legislature in Tallahassee so we couldn't do anything about you correct and so anything that could not yes thank you so it's Mr NFL I appreciate you call me JC everybody else any other questions or comments for JC S no thank you so much for your report thanks have a good night all right and Mr reefer if you track down that copy that's got the highlighting on it and make sure that they did copy of it yes what I gathered from the meeting was about because the amount of pages the language is they felt that it was a customer understands and they were worried that the average resident trying to follow the code so it was left for Mr to try to streamline it make it easier to understand okay is he working on that house yes so when everything happens it needs to come back to us first right okay thank you very much all right now we are on to number seven the City attorney report contract from trash Daniel is filling in for Mr Moore tonight Mr trash you have the Lord thank you I did speak to Randy he said that although he has been talking to you about the adoption Senate Bill 170 which is one of you to thank you very much any questions for Mr trash all right thank you very much now we are on to number eight the city manager's report this week for you thank you Mary I'll start off with the underground project uh we actually started construction phase today uh for the conduit going on the ground on phase one and as a reminder at 28th Avenue South uh Southern jurisdiction of the city of two causary Boulevard and then moving on the utility Consultants of Florida are working on uh phase two the stormwater projects we are currently got about half the streets surveyed coming in as they come into Gemini engineering they're being designed and um Georgia ship and Associates is planning on they're finishing up the survey so in a matter of exams a personal policy manual um continue to work on this received City attorney comments back from Mr shinfeld he promoted a lot of data Insight added a lot to our personal policy man yoga was missing it could be the legal status and we did a little history looking into some of the coordinates that were referenced in the previous documents and it's been in the past with personal policy that the city has passed it by ordinance so in order to um make our revision legal we need to pass an ordinance which I have Mr Moore drafting at this point hopefully in August will be my first reading and that what that'll do is it'll sort of supersede all the previous ordinances and allow us to whenever we amend the policy manual to commend my resolution the way to do it um I would like to bring up and uh in our budget Workshop we discussed future savings for a City Patrol boat for code enforcement from the water something that's come up this past week where some of our Waterway markers were already experiencing issues with the big Clearwater Harbor another use I just wanted to bring that up good news this week the the ongoing Code Enforcement issue with a tree I have a scheduled with an arborist I got permission from the property owner to go on the private property and we're going to do the sterile analysis of that tree and then I'd like to come back up to the top project which is our 2023-24 budget we have our next budget Workshop coming up on July 7 th after that we will adopt the tenant of the military tonight in our last budget Workshop meeting we said that tonight we would make a decision on the waste collection services on whether we are like we negotiate reason and eventuals our current contract that is expiring the end of September or if we're going to advertise an RFP those services over the weekend that provided you with some documents or some information that was gathered in the past a week and a half or so um first document kind of laid out the price increases the rate increases that we've experienced in our current contract provided a documentary from a waste management that summarized all the cost increases in the different areas of Waste Management business through the document on the recent Florida Municipal big results across the State of Florida from 2019 the this current year showing you know the different contracts that went out to RFP and were awarded who they are awarded to what the percentage of increase was per ler municipality in a different amount RFP and this this uh the percentage of an increase Compares their services directly to their previous contracts so as you know every city is different the contracts are different so the best way and lastly I prepared I did a lot of research on working with the county on our our Utility Billing how it's set off how it's built through the multi-family dumpsters first of all they canned in the single family residence I tried to lay out where the group currently at a bi-monthly billing and is in the utility bill all the other accounting utilities and how that covers our revenue from that how that covers our current contract and what we were looking at as far as a rate increase for a future contract that the proposed or the estimated I should say increase of 25 percent that's all I have I just want to believe it had that decision marker all right can we have any questions for the city manager yes Mr Roberts so excuse me the cloud cells with regards to the waste management contract situation if the city wants to go out to a user request for proposal do you need a decision on that tonight it would be preferable uh the last time we did an RFP uh was was advertised on June 22nd of the contract of the Year expiring and um they received the bids on fourth so we're a little bit behind that schedule I was told by Mr Moore that our RFP schedules is aggressive per um what he experiences in other cities but I do think it's doable we've done it in the past so I propose that if we do RFP we can advertise by July 26th and received the beginning time August 29th leaving enough time to bring it to the September regular meeting okay so is that something we need to to vote on I make a motion that we put an RFP out you'll have to all we're doing is looking for the bench suppose I mean we have to be waste management and and every time reporting before we do that I just kind of one question what was your thoughts on the data that was after you look at all of the data how did you feel about the price increase when I compare it to the other this Valley Cities counties that went out to RFP the data shows that the uh the awarded contracts are coming back higher than the proposed estimated renegotiated rate of release management my biggest concern is that we go out to RFP and at least side that we want to Circle back to waste management but at that point we're actually paying more of the same services fair enough uh what I'd like to hear out of your mouth what your recommendation is to people my recommendation based on the numbers figures speaking with other municipalities and also speaking of municipalities who aren't satisfied with their service after they've changed would be the simple ways to have them through looking at the history of the services to our residents we've been with them for a long time and I know there's a very positive relationship with our residents I rarely hear any problem if there is a problem police management response immediately and addresses the problem so in my my time is mandating even in my previous position I've been very satisfied tissue Bankers after hearing uh his comments about this are you still for rip well I don't think an order of Peace would have hurt anything else we're good so Council doesn't want to council would you stick with the hiring we didn't come back with him removable there's a couple of holidays to be able to come back it was going to make minimal difference to remove the holidays per week um I just would like to make a point that in my meetings with Waste Management if they renegotiate they estimate 25 increase what they're saying is if we go out to RFP they are based on the numbers that they believe were going to come back higher even though they're lowest bidder um the last time we did an RFP the lowest bidder was 13 we special was 13 more than the lowest paid we ended up going with basement doing the reviews of the scoring process again I would just looking at all the information I feel based on the time we've had waste management and my experience with them and here in the feedback from presence I I don't believe that the numbers are going to come back I know database management is saying that they're going to be higher it wouldn't be coming a little bit than what they're going to renegotiate at and like I said I a couple other cities that have changed their services and they weren't happy with the until the lowest bitterism was the answer so that's why I recommend that all right so it sounds like we are down to the viral making of decision but I don't believe we can vote on this because it wasn't only am I correct you can do it on this tonight tonight okay so would anyone or to approve this this contract rate increase well that's going to come back to you this is just do you want to go out to RFP or not the negotiated contract will come back well that's what I'm saying is we have to agree that's a whole month from now all you have to do in a special meeting so the contract will come back to you after the next break in the meeting if it's if it's been properly prepared yes they wanted us to commit to renegotiation to start the process on the okay so if anyone would like to do a new RFP uh I'll be a motion otherwise we have one question we're not into the rating proposal screen you know not we're not watching that ranking came out and said just wait for the next year so the projected rate is really bad at 25 increase now they're going to throw up a contract that's in La probably very similar to what we have now I think what Mr riesler is saying and correctly if I'm wrong is that if this goes down to RIT they'd have to get in on it also and we may not necessarily get the same rate back had his perspective Council comments is this something that we would need or ask we're not voting on anything we're thinking we're asking questions okay yeah okay so so I appreciate very much the position that Kyle is in here's what I have difficulty with first of all um when the current vendor made the comment that we're willing to negotiate a certain percentage increase which we think is very good that they're saying however if we go out and we ask for a request or proposal there's sort of threatening for lack of a better term that when they give their proposal number it's probably not going to be as be as good as a negotiated member that sounds very odd to me first of all secondly when we're dealing with taxpayers dollars and we don't know we have no clue what the other competitors maybe big through their proposal and anytime I could just get involved with a government organization um I spoke with column the city organization has some minimum amount of money that you can understand uh it has to go to request for data or a request for proposal if it exceeds that number which is a good thing now Kyle pointed out to me that actually there's verb is in the current contract you know it says we have the option of renegotiating with them without going out to another RFP again I don't support that only because of the unknown is and what we may be hit with if we do it the other way another company probably will come forward and say hey not only if you're going out to proposal I'm confident I would I would be that number and then we're sitting in a very uncomfortable position with the way that we spend taxpayers dollars so that's what I'm uncomfortable without going that route I can't imagine another company like Waste Management saying we would negotiate with you with a number of Acts but if you go out with a request for a proposal where our number is going to be X Plus that makes no sense to me other comments well the only other thing is the number that we should actually throughout the which is a public immigration and deal with contract with all my life anyone that's going to fit this job to open that number and say I can beat it um I'm not saying wasting active isn't going to come back and say we're going to upgrade or whatever you never know like attractions of dirty business quite obviously I got no problem with wasting advocacy doing an excellent job and I just think they're a little bit high on the cost I mean they haven't last year if you remember they came back and said we're fueled up to five dollars a gallon and this is up and labors up their labor their labor costs have bottom to help this past year fuels down uh 450 down from diesel from Over the six and where do we get 25 increase so that's that's the problem well I guess what we need we need to find out if we have a consensus on this at all so what I would just like to hear is from each council member of what they think which is what they prefer to move forward with the uh the proposed contract or to do an rmp sorry we really appreciate Kyle's um Joe and I appreciate everything 's doing okay for a way to what he recommended however Frank and boy have a very good no business goes without getting a request for a proposal and I love voicemail I love what they've done for the citizens they're great they've been over efforts for us but I think during our due diligence I want to talk vice mayor sure I think we should tell us able to concur uh go out here in America to Robert all right baby on this case I am in the minority and I agree with Mr rieckler also but uh counselors is pretty much said their feelings and I think two seven made by Frank Baker so it's a seconded by lightsaber Mr Banker you have a tour I think we should just see the competitive bidding hopefully it doesn't come back later so I mean I don't think it will but that's all I have to say all right we made a motion like I'm gonna have to make what do you need citizens like to make a comment yes sir John Manson 22nd Street I was here for that Workshop I was one of the few full person here when you discussed this contract and I listened to the place management kind um my question would be are we at the end of the current contract typically when we do these contracts they're multi-year contracts within those contracts that stipulates a maximum cost increase am I correct it stimulates a maximum cost increase of four percent based on cost index in the past two years if you look at the layout of the CPI increases they've asked for more different inflationary prices until September 30th 2023 so the problem so we're not going to be able to find over Waste Management on the specific dollar amount because the term of the contract that's expired that the contract also provides as the city manager has mentioned known as read the language for you the city May indicate the desire to renew the agreement for an additional term the term is 60 months upon giving the contractor 30 days prior to it notice the attempt to renew Renewables shall be by mutual agreement in such event this agreement may be renewed under the same terms of conditions including the payment adjustments has set forth in section 9. section 9 shows the dollar amounts and then all the sub paragraphs and these are the reasons why we can increase it like the CBI and the gas and those types of things okay I wasn't completely clear on whether we were at the end of the current contract or not so okay um the other thing is as I recall from the budget workshop on this topic because census then was you were going to lean towards leaving that door open but consider seriously rfps so I think go in the right direction take a chance but I can't see what this gentleman was trying to justify 25 that's waiting on whatever I think it's really reasonable that's my opinion thank you Mr Hansen for any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right back to the council so this is the motion to uh do an RFP or Waste Services um I guess could you just development all in favor all right so we have one of those I went the other way to be with a group and the opposer was in the Terrible anything else Mr River that is all i'll get on it okay I did have one more question for you which was um the boat what how much money are you uh proposing to spend for both um right now I'm a government contract for a patrol boat has a lot of options on it it's for shallow water it is good until 20 I know we can uh negotiate if we decide on the exact uh model that we want and then go on power of people and get it lower the best options one thing I do not want to do is I think that we need something that's uh and a hundred thousand dollars today it's not um let me ask you this if you've got your vote would it keep you from jumping in the water again it was only because I wasn't doing it I can't say that 100 all right any other questions or comments for Mr real please Mr Roberts and the Kyle um back to the school morning Ruben context which is wonderful that we're moving forward with all of the balance of the of the streets my question to you is I know we discussed once before even actually offered then the engineering firm at some point would come forward either be a workshop which is probably more applicable for the council meeting what would you kind of visualizing how that was going to work are they going to be more on the front end or after they've completed the design what do you think would work best I was envisioning and probably kind of out laid out in our our schedule is once they get to above the 90 percent design um I think look at it on all different options and coming and addressing the council and that's still on the table perfect yes sir thank you any other questions or comments to the state manager all right so now we are on to item number nine this is the city clerk report it's Gentry do you have before no report this month mayor a report any questions or comments

since January 2020. but you've lived here for a while um can you explain that no it must be a mistake on my part I'm not sure on the application the voter registration date oh I probably was thinking about just being in Florida we moved in December of May so that's probably what I was thinking was in general okay yeah I don't have any other questions anyone else want to cancel all right thank you again very nice to meet you all right uh is Mr leeks here if so would you like to introduce yourself to the council good evening my name is Michael lease I am a resident of Miller Beach since uh 2016

my application thank you very much any other questions so how long will you redo 28 years thank you Mr Lee very nice to meet you all right before I ask for a motion to appoint any citizen like to speak of this matter code says some comments are now closed now I'm going to need a motion to a point to how did the two positions differ Patty I guess we go to Patty and I understand that one is for a full term I could explain that okay they're exactly the same it's one as a whole other is to fill the Gap from okay all right so one is a very short term and that person can reapply what's up does that mean that in September remember we're going to have another appointment yes I get that right yes okay so now I'm going to need a motion to make an appointment at least made by Frank Baker do I have a second second say goodbye uh Lloyd Roberts all right Mr Bank have you had it before I guess we've just now hope to take the uh well make sense to me all right it's time to vote vote for a vote one or nine it must be specific about which term your candidate is being selected for no two candidates can fill the same term for both terms each must have a minimum of four votes to be appointed if need in the council will make up to three attempts to fill those terms either of the terms are not filled we will advertise and try again next month I don't expect that to be the case does everyone have a ballot all right let's move foreign [Applause] Patty are you ready yes all right council member Banker voted for Miss Conti for the term ending September 23. and Mr Reese ending July 25.

Estates Island assessment area directing certification of the assessment rules of Pinellas County Tax Collector and providing for an effective date that was a reading of your resolution 2023-0 thank you very much Mr trash Mr rieckler I'm assuming that you you agenda and I had a generator is that correct that's correct all right would you like to explain the need for this resolution so uh with the assessment this is a requirement that we do every year we recertify it and we do it in July for you we'll probably have 15 more years [Music] that sounds great that would say 15 and basically what happens is uh associated with Prague that goes through the three different loans make sure that everyone who paid off gets removed and then checks the interest rates um and re-certified it'll be submitted to the property appraiser to get going thank you before we move forward with Aces I'd like to comment on this proposed resolution let's get some comments all right our Council I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution motion made by Leslie material do I have a second seconded by Jody Shirley Mr Terry you have the floor thank you any uh further comments resolution nope pretty much just standard housekeeping every year in that case this is to approve resolution 2023-04 Miss Gentry would you please call the roller council member Baker yes council member Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council members able aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye so it passes you uh unanimously thank you very much all right we are on to item number 17. this is for authorization the city managers to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department for fiscal year 2023 uh 24 city manager Ridgewood thank you mayor this is the law enforcement contract typically in the previous years we had law enforcement on its own contract and the code enforcement on another contract this year when the new contract was drafted it was made clear by the sheriff's office that it's unusual that we have two contracts and asked would consider going to one Contracting they said the terms of the contractor would be the same essentially um combined and leaving our code enforcement Services as a as an even basis which is which they have in the past so the new proposed contract for the amount for the law enforcement Services is the 592 716 that is an increase of 7.94 from last year's and then the code enforcement is built on a per hour basis and it increased to 55.66 per hour which is a 7.5 increase a little history in the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office has done our law enforcement since 201 7 when we expanded from the police department in Code Enforcement Services we've used sheriff's deputy to assist since 2020 from the beginning of the code forces of it being done by Pinellas County we use them at a 20 hour program week rate last year we decided during our budget meetings that we drop it down to 15 hours per week at Seattle room that's going well in my opinion and I propose that uh this is currently here I'll be starting October 1 we utilized 12 hours of code enforcement for a week supplementing with in-house staff and uh this contract has been reviewed by eternal and it's provided thank you Mr wrinkler before we move to the housework into the citizens for comments for any citizen would like to make now yes Transit thank you John Hanson 22nd Street it's interesting the annual increases year over year to get higher higher decision close to three percent more of the mice this conference we are I believe so I don't know what's going on inflation's down I think it was Transit videos all right said some comments are closed and now we're back to the council before we continue on going to need a motion for authorization for execution of this contract total motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second I avoid Roberts vice mayor Shirley you had before other questions or comments Mr Baker um page four okay this contract is it refreshing to the count of memory and the citizens shared our deputy how many hours a day do we share to one hour per ship to walk for two hours I don't have those numbers in front of me I know it's been reviewed at least for the past two years I can find that out okay I forgot what it was determined um I was told it was like one hour per shift but a couple residents have raised questions to me and I've noticed in the last couple weeks and I'm not excluding July 4th weekend because Bel Air Shores having paid for extra Police Service committee service great just noticing on the beach in the parking lots very frequently just one day two weeks ago would definitely spent over three hours from Sixth Street to cross street picking cars taking a 10 off of The Sixth Street taking two umbrellas off of 12th Street and taking two bicycles off at 6th Street now we spent over seventeen thousand dollars per hour 30 days a week I believe shortages we no longer get the tax we never no longer get the fine to the parking at this three-pointers so they get out they have to write it up one traditions did a inquiry of how much time is being spent it was well over three hours a day is look at the house quality of them every day they do have twice a day no way they do this in two hours and I believe we should be getting the dollar store should be getting at least three hours a day back with us with service which would save you guys are not 17 there were seventeen thousand dollars so I think we should table this contract I'm going to put it on the floor right now that we should make a motion to pay all this contract until we get a review of how much of the time Belair Shores is actually using our Deputy on our time we have a motion in the table yeah on the floor right now but anyone like the second that motion all right the motion dies so the conversation will continue with anyone else like to make a comment about this contract disabled yeah um I understand that obviously the rate did go up in referring to code enforcement but the dollar amount does not because the lower hours on this offset any potential increase here um what I'm going to ask I mean I understand the concerns about Bel Air Shores but at this point I believe the best method is actually you approve the contract and now that we have a contract let me go forward to approach Bel Air Shores with you know reducing the potential hours in because this contract is between us and the county not us and Delaware Shores so I'm recommending that we go forward and uh with this contract thank you Mr saber another comments totally what a legal question can we sign this contract and then go back in charge of Valor shorts will be flying out here I think that'd be more than they're paying for this contract specifically provides that you're going to share of the Deputy doesn't say anything other than that so once you've signed this contract this will this will of course I ask for any contributions made or set off by Miller Shore that would be an agreement between this my question is it's an open-ended contract when it comes to the time that we're sharing a step it is open-ended to the extent that we use the word share and doesn't have any specific that's and that's my that's my problem after getting our citizens are getting tickets our citizens are telling them they need to remove this and they have to move remove that name our Deputy we're paying our Deputy to do I'm not sure whether or not this has changed from last year whether this was the same language as last year something I understand it's the same language as the same assessment of the percentage of time I believe it is and uh because other areas have similar contracts with the sheriff's department I think that the goal is is to be able to to tend to demand anywhere that is needed and other than the sheriff not being here tonight which I'm very disappointed about considering we're debating over their contracts I have no good plans with the service that we've received I I think if we could step up correctly such as the street on Street party that and I would also be interested in knowing if part of that contract includes their leading here because this I believe is the second or third time so I do have a problem with that and it needs to be resolved uh it definitely won't prevent me from voting for this contract however I want this address going forward and I think no matter what we should always have someone else the community and the council and the staff are all safe any other questions or comments let's take it to the boat all right this is for authorization of the city manager to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff for fiscal year 2023-2024 pay council member Baker no council member Livingstone yes council member Otero yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley hi mayor goddess hi so it passes six to one this rate for you are authorized to receive amen item 18 unfinished business we have any other communication all right we will move right on over to city council comments by the way this is item number 19. this month the randomizer begins with council members Sable great um two big items that are up in front of Florida people right now especially us uh one is Beach renourishment and the second one is high insurance rates and I just wanted to draw your attention to the work of the city council specifically uh councilman Baker then is continuing fight to get lower insurance rates or even get questions about the insurance rates answered by our limited representatives in Tallahassee nourishment the mayor has been very vocal in working with various local groups specifically on this topic and maybe you can address them later on but the next Big C median I understand there's going to be some updates on that issue and I believe we're hosting it here on the 26th yes okay so that's uh we usually Supply free food you know coffee and it's really good to understand what's going on with the rest of the beach communities that's all I am thank you thank you Mr Zoo all right now we are on to council member Notaro all right we'll do provide all over the council member Banker um today I sat down with uh representative Fairfield our state rep about wind Insurance um and the changes they made last December He was unaware of a couple things in the state and I'm talking about him statue now which requires each individual if they want to carry One Insurance it now has to match their flood insurance and she pointed out to me that she's looking into secondary homes compared to primary homes and maybe adjusting the rates there and make it more equal but one of the things I addressed to her was about insurance fraud and what they what the state has done now is they put themselves in the 750 billion dollar liability when it comes to cost because they're escalating all these policies to be maxed out so you have to Max at 250 75 000 for contents then your foot has to Max at that and to rebuild some of these homes or for well under four hundred thousand dollars the first thing people do to get insurance adjuster to come out and they just bring everyone now she says well you know that's insurance for our academic paper it's over 125 000 roofing insurance fraud claims were found fraudulent claims just in 2020 I see so they found 125 000 how many people really got to wait so she's going to readdress this and get back to me with a couple people in the state and the other thing is I've been talking to Ray Scott's office I thought it was getting somewhere with him and the end of last month he sent me a consent form to get into this deeper and then last Monday uh I got another consent for from one of his Liaisons to fill out and I actually blew a gasket I had as cheap as staff on the phone saying oh it was a misunderstanding we're going to get in so I wrote the Rick Scott and I mailed it break it down to his Naples address and I did get a call today from FEMA we're gonna have to sit down hopefully within a week or two about the percentages deductions noted in 2.0 per flood elevation that everyone is supposed to be getting here but if you look at your elevation certificate without if you look at your premiums without your elevation certificates it's probably the same with your own patients for each foot or H6 inches you're supposed to receive the discount plus the city supposed to get a 20 discount for the things we did to modify 2.0 and nobody from the NFI paid FEMA can show us where that discount is so that's all I have to say thank you Mr Baker all right Mr Roberts you're up thank you I find this kind of compliment both uh Mike and Frank at our last uh Workshop that we had a topic came up that might have been working worth a while regarding the same challenges that we have back over here on the 9th Street and the cool part about it was so Mike made his presentation why he thought the best idea was to move the same banking operation [Music] which was an idea and their brain said brought up reasons as to why that probably wasn't the most effective process for our city for our citizens that's when it really happened addition time we have discussions about what we think is best for our city because through a discussion by all seven adults that are up here a whole different approach came to be which was really the best solution and fixed the problem the problem was traffic flow coming in and out but through that discussion I don't know how many you people have actually participated in that Infamous you're on a rocket ship and you crashed on the moon and you have 15 items that you need to rank from one through 15 that's the most important thing you do it individually and then you get together in a group and I've done it many many times with with departments that I've worked with and each and every time the group solution is superior to every single individual ranking in the 10 to 15 member group has been put together and that's what actually happened in scenario about the sandbank operation because Mike then heard different input and he grew together a solution that we excuse me move the traffic which there's a little space behind us over here that's going to allow the traffic if everybody agrees to it and come down 9th Street and then exit all in one motion and get back out onto the whole book which was really the problem so it was just kind of cool I just wanted to thank everybody on this Council to work that through and it came out really nice thank you for yourself okay all right okay this month I have little to report concerning Beach nourishment at The Big C Beach nourishment dominated the meeting however the county is still holding out in hopes that the Army Corps will have a change of heart I get the feeling that the county is afraid that if they fully fund it once they will be expected to fund it every time in the meantime the majority of the millions collected from the FED tax continues to be spent on Advertising to bring more and more people to our beaches perhaps I'm missing something but if there's no beach when they get here then what happens I would encourage everyone here to contact your County Commissioners not just one not just the one that represents us but every single one of them and demand that the county creative plan and fully fund Beach nourishment for Santee Island as mentioned once before Council we have an upcoming budget workshop and tentative military meeting on the 17th and finally I have heard Rumblings at least four members on this Council are either ineligible or have decided not to run again apparently having to submit full Financial disclosures is already having an impact which I suspect was the whole purpose of enacting it so the question is do we really need seven council members or should we reduce the five next should we increase our terms to four years and align them with a general and midterm elections aside from cost cost savings overall turnout should increase dramatically finally should we increase term limits to three currently we are limited to six years or two terms I have seen firsthand that this limit prevents our city from gaining any traction in the county our needs and our opinions have little weight in Pinellas County due to the lack of time to build these relationships I question to each of you is are you willing to consider restructuring the city council in our election cycle I ask this because it's very very important to me that our city dudes its very best and it looks like the path that we're going right now we're not going to have either the amount or the quality of candidates we've had in the past so I just want to take up informal survey right quick listener would you be interested in having that conversation is Chris able yes Miss Livingstone Mr Roberts about the changes yes Mr Baker no vice mayor Shirley yes all right so I have a four to two and then I would make five so I will be reaching out to pay to see if we can schedule a work session to discuss this whether we make changes or not I believe it would be irresponsible of us not to have this conversation as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as those who've watched remotely do I have a motion picture motion moved on brain Baker thanks always first starting line right increase doing a second for me uh Wesley all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone thank you very much"
