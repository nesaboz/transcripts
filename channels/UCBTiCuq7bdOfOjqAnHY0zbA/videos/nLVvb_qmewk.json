solemnly declare or affirm that the testimony you are about to give in these proceedings is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I thank you we have one variance that we have to adjudicate tonight I'll U for the benefit of the applicant and his representative I'll go over the rules of what we're going to do in the procedures uh because we're going to invite you to come up and give testimony and and any information and support to this case I will initially read the variant's request and then the staff report will be made by our city manager then we will ask you as the applicant to come up and make a statement at the podium and then we will have discussion amongst the board and with you as the applicant regarding the entire variance at that point it's the burden of the board to go ahead and vote on a series of six criteria questions that you had in the application and that we will review one at a time in order for the variant to pass all six criteria questions must get an affirmative answer any of the six gets a no vote the variance will be rejected we will take our time we'll we'll explain everything to you and after the criteria the board will make a motion and we'll also have a second and we'll have a roll call vote on your variance pretty simple procedure but we'll go ahead and and and get started on it at this point this is variance request 24-1 and the applicant is asking for a variance to city code 94220 220 to install water feature within the front setback Kyle if you'd like to go ahead and make our staff report and explain it to our um to our board members we appreciate yes sir Kyle rler City Manager for b beach um this is covering the report given to us by Larry fluty our city contract engineer um the section of code is the uh chapter 94 zoning code which is 94220 which establishes the minimum living area setbacks um if you're familiar with the minimum living area set backs uh all front set backs within every parcel of b beach is 25 ft and after reviewing the plans that were submitted uh Larry flu established that the uh the setback encroachment needed to have this Fountain is 4T so it is a measurement 21 ft back from the property line so we have a 4ot encroachment of a structure by definition in our city code this water feature is a structure uh that's correct um by the definition um the engineer felt that because it was a vertical um not easily movable um what you would call portable structure it it is a permanent structure and it um required a wiring to be done by electrici so at some point the city code enforcement officer um discovered this violation and pointed it out to the homeowner or the or the contractor is that correct yes um I think it was reported to the code officer that um someone felt that work was being done without a permit and he investigated and you know found the structure called me for advice and we from there looked at it said yes we believe this needs a permit they appli for a permit uh L denied permit for the encroaching on the front set back and that's where we're at okay any questions of kle from the board like this with the St B all built turn on your mic was built uh in let's say someone's island of their driveway okay like this like this gentleman has an island driveway Circle driveway and if they wanted to build a water feature like this on in the island let's say away from the structure would that need a permit if it was the same design we would Define it as a structure so yes it would be a structure in the front set back and is these Boulders going up as high as the uh front stoop of the where the front door is is it going up that whole wall or just to where the boulders are now I don't believe it's that tall um no it's it's as is is it's complete that's the complete struction and the circle driveway still going to be there yes front of the yeah the new or the new feature thank you how were there any um emails or letters from any neighbors no I have not received any comments so this is actually buting right up against the the front part of the house where the setback line presumably is very close to that and the encroachment is coming on Street side of the of the building in front of the building um it's basically I can't say it's attached to it but it is a permanent structure yes it is a structure by definition because it has a veral component it's not u a portable structure that's defined differently for this for the board's sake we've had these kind of variances in the past um some of them are related to Spas portable Spas um the building department at the county U takes the position and we agree with it that if this these Spas which in many cases have a gazebo top and it's making look like a a a small building or a small small room that these are consider considered portable as long as there's just a plug in for electricity if they're hardwired the added toe the building department we agree is that this is permanent it's not REM it is removable for temp when cutting it but it's considered tied into the building as long as the electric is hard this is hard the structure of L the house and is between the house and the driveway correct yes it's between the house and D way and I don't believe it makes actual contact with the house any other questions before we ask the applicant to come to the podium gentlemen whoever wants to to make the statement on behalf of the owner please come forward give us your name and and uh hi I'm Jerry Rickard I own Bel Air property name it's of landscaping um I was the contractor on theob okay um so you were the one that was surprised by the officer for you yes were yes sir welcome to b beach now here's our law yes sir um there is no concrete that binds The Boulders together um they can be taken apart at any given time um and move if Dr kusano does want to move he can take them and he can have them move to wherever he wants to go um there's a pond liner so it's a concealed SE sealed unit um we uh we looked up permits beforehand because we seen different water features within the community and as you can see there's some that I pull up here that there wasn't any permits pulled so we considered it a landscape modification because there's no concrete binding in and uh uh we were misled to understand that it was considered a structuring b beach misled by who uh my own thoughts okay yeah um I've been in the trade for 26 years um we've never had to pull permits for a water fature that's contained and if you can see here there's other that are considered structures within Belair Beach that have concrete that are considered a structure that can't be bu that never got permits what we're doing tonight is is resting on the merits of this particular property yes sir we as a board make recommendations to our our Council we adjudicate on behalf of the city but what happened in the past is in the past okay it's no precedent per se it takes place but we appreciate the fact you did some resarch search and you looked around it yes sir it tells us as a city that we have to decide going forward even after your case um if all these upcoming water features or um masonry features whether or not they have electricity or not need to be considered as structural for our future whether or not they all need permits going forward Y and it is not hardwired it is a plugin so it does have a pump that plugs into a re CLE so it's not hardwired fixed into a receptacle as far as that goes is the receptacle within the Set Set uh no sir it's not like yeah it's beyond the setb it's within it's it's against it's against the wall it's against the house so against the house so it's out of the setb out of the yes sir Dr G you're welcome to come join in oh sorry that's okay we appreciate all the information both you want to give us um that microphone down a little bit there sure so yeah I wasn't familiar with that um again we hired him and my understanding was unfortunately if we didn't realize that the way it was built was going into you know that the setback in that that area I again unfortunately and I apologized misunderstood again against the house and then it came down to the front and and I guess the The Rock I think is like um foot and a half into it and then there's um a bin that the water goes into that's lined and and pumped out and I think that's 2T2 and I think that's also considered part of the 4T whereas you know it's the rock only goes in like a foot and a half to 2 ft and then there's a ditch there that just the water goes into that's only about I don't know how deep is that 18 in so again I I apologize you know for this I'll learn my lesson we're not here spanking T that um question for app um as a contractor did you provide this sheet to us as a photograph with the dimension of 19.3 7 ft and I'm not sure what that means um I don't know if it comes up on the it's kind of scrolling back now close we don't know what the purpose of that 19.3 7 ft is as it relates to the Fountain location yeah that is from where the setback starts to where it ends um it was just pretty much they wanted the measurements of the property within the packet per scale so that's just a paper that we added into that shows the setback Red Line being a setback line problem yes sir everybody see that one okay the with the feature ke of the distri that it would beard and could it be made smaller instead of where it is now could come back and still have the water be within the set is that possible um within the the aqua blocks to hold the water so the the pump doesn't dry up they need a certain gallon size for the pump and everything one of the questions you had to ask was whether or not this is the minimum variance and in essence you you've answered that by saying water peaches stck as close to the house as possible yes so the size of the size of the water feature and the location it you're only encroaching into the minimum amount of area of our 25 setb we'll V on that here short that answers Carol's question gentleman reference that you could in the future if you wanted to move rocks would it be your intention to move rocks in the future and expand it or no there wouldn't be no expanding it's it's as big as it's going to get and you know that's as much as the pumpin so that's pretty much how was designed and built just before we vote the last thing I want to mention is that again on the application are two buzzword two Buzz phrases that we we review here is whether or not this property had any special conditions or unique circumstances that dictated why you needed to get a variance um based on the location where where where you've chosen to to put the um the water feature um you really didn't have any other choice I mean a special condition in essence is established but that's one of the important things that we look at you know is there hardship not necessarily the hardship is it you where where where you want to put it comes into our 25 foot front set back and that's the board's discretion is sign up tonight yes sir get any more information questions board David good okay yeah go ahead okay okay this time I'll ask Vice chairman um Jane Goldman if she'd go ahead and start reading our criteria questions that we will vote on one at a time gentlemen you're welcome to stand the podium or sit down it's up to you you can relax okay good have a little bit of a tickle so if I have to stop I'll raise my hand okay all right so for our purposes today we have to go over each one of these questions and respond and everyone way in so on question number one have you demonstrated that special conditions or unique circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other similar structures or building the same zoning District Yes means it's okay no means it's denied Miss conry no Mr Gardella yes Mr

the U for your actual period I mean apply for your permit K I don't know whether or not they have a uh short version of a permit process up there like they do when you move air conditioners or or condensers I don't know when it comes to Landscaping how long it takes to go through the review process that's the longest part of the whole thing because you know you have to re you have to apply
