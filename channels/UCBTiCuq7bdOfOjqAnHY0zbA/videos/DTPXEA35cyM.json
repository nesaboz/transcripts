    "transcript": "so so what's up for minutes um this is a zoom conference so she would have to use the she would have to use the link the zoom conference to dial in so that there's a phone number associated with it so she should be able to dial that number and they will appear [Music] okay i apologize for the delays just when we think we've got it we have enough time and take mine it's not offline okay that's all we've got right there so i'll get you to move there okay don't anyone touch them [Applause] jerry can you hear us hey shirley can you hear us it's jody yes i can hear you okay i'm sorry i'm muted because i'm in my car no worries no worries all right it's now 5 002 pm july 18th and the special counsel meeting will come to order please rise and join me for the pledge of allegiance i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all point of order did you say july 18th i did i think today council member leslie otero here council member lloyd roberts council member jody shirley here council member mike sable here vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gattis and city attorney randy mora president thank you very much this evening we are conducting interviews with four candidates for the city manager position each candidate will be interviewed for 20 minutes followed by a 10-minute council discussion about that candidate after all candidate time cycles are completed we will take a five-minute break then resume discussions to vote for two candidates earlier today we all received an email from city attorney maura concerning do's and don'ts and sample questions mr mora would you like to give a brief summary of the days sure just very very briefly uh to be clear i did provide some sample questions you are in no way bound by those questions they were offered as a suggestion as some members have not had the opportunity to interview a public official in best practices it's often advised that your questions be consistent so that you can consistently compare the responses you received again that is at your discretion as each of you individually proceed with this as a general reminder as you take notes those notes may be public records as you take notes on the candidates and be mindful of that that's not an admonition not to just a reminder and also as far as the aims of this that your your questions should be targeted at the individual skills not their views beliefs personal lives unless those are beliefs that are very specific to the role like i believe in the management style of x as opposed to you know i believe this party is a better political party or something of the sort um this is a a a political job in that respect and so we're not looking for those kinds of questions somebody's family life and other similar questions are not relevant to this inquiry and i would advise you to stay away from those and target more the person's professional capacity to perform the role that you intend to hire for thank you very much we have about four minutes until the first interview is scheduled to begin uh during that time i'll take questions or comments from the council concerning the interview how are we going to rotate through is it like one question per yeah what i'm going to do is i'm going to first off we know it's a 20-minute interview and what we're going to do is do a brief introduction with the candidate and then we will immediately proceed into questions from the council and we will just start on this side or that side and rotate around until everyone is asked a question and we'll continue doing that until uh the very end of the interview and um and that's really about it he's got time at the beginning to kind of introduce that's that's what i uh basically i'm gonna ask him to give a brief uh introduction so uh i think i think that should be sufficient yes sir um let's say for example we have three of the four that just knock it out of the park is there going to be hopefully we'll have the opportunity to say hey we wanted to three is two in concrete you um you know i consider that and it sort of defeats the purpose and i also believe that there's only going to be two top candidates and so there could be possibly a third if there was a tie but i think generally what happens is we take another boat to see if we can narrow it down at the end of the first vote i think we'll clearly see two winners but then again we can always change okay all right i i will definitely consider that if it looks like it's a time across three equal candidates what would be the backup plan then if you take the top two or from jobs well i think the the plan at this point is we take the top two and we ask them to come back next week for in-person interviews and that's where we'll be able to spend more time with them and and they'll also be able to ask us questions and at that time i think that you could be comfortable with would be my thoughts but there has to be someone that we select and hopefully the next candidate is you know that's that's not a bad idea if we have the top three and one of them drops out maybe we should pull the third one in i'd like to have two two people to interview next week my advice to you having done this process with other councils is eat the elephant and the only way to do that is one bite at a time so go through your process tonight as best you can it's good to have an eye towards the various possibilities and probabilities but your hand may you may say we're going to revert to our third and your third may go on the record saying if i'm not in your top two i'm not interested and so having those plans you know it's good to have an idea but i think it's better to to i would advise you to be a little more fluid and go with what your intention is at this time and then if we need to adapt we can adapt accordingly ultimately this is your process the council is charged with hiring the manager and so you folks will be at the helm of that at the end of this i would like everyone on this council to be comfortable with the final decision and feel like it was a fair process so that being said the zoom meeting i think it's time so [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] hmm [Applause] hmm see him there okay based upon what i'm looking at we don't have the campaign can we give the candidate a call and make sure that he's logged in or that we're logged into the correct conference that was the first one so [Applause] yes yes [Applause] is are you trying to log in this is is no that ends in 3 2 7 5 6 8 2 4 seven seven five two zero three two seven times oh but the green one actually works pretty good pretty naturally kind of baffles for some people it bounces off you know you know what are you calling that purple is yeah but that's purple you know that's like everybody has a laser in that one i want one not telling anybody okay that's what i like about her mary he's very technically stupid we should give him mileage i think yeah these are a techno tech protect guy hey my machine scale let me try turning it on and off do you want to hear that after a while i got a mug that's at our tfm juice just in case don't love that angle open famous [Music] else okay my question to them was how far it would burn into the scale so far they didn't want to take it and put it in there let's hear something unless he has something later tonight i'm sure okay because [Applause] now this does not work come on okay not a good start happens guys if we can refrain from any sidebars until we're back fully on the record in your email okay [Applause] [Applause] thank you very much [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so [Applause] so [Applause] [Applause] time is we're going to do a telephone call well i didn't want him i didn't want to take time away from what he did [Applause] in the meantime we have a few more minutes so what i would advise everyone to do is do what you're doing right now and just researching candidates and we'll pick this back up in about eight minutes i apologize for the technical difficulties occasionally this happens mayor can i stop the recordings while we're out of session thank you i would advise each of you to refrain from any council of business discussions [Applause] hmm and you said let him in as soon as he gets here he's here hello everybody hello mr kamali welcome and uh thank you for joining us i am dave danis mayor of eller beach and uh it's very nice to meet you would you like to start out by giving us a brief introduction for the council absolutely my name is pete cavalli i don't know if you remember i know mr nintaro does i worked for the city of bellerin beach back in 2005 to 2010 so i feel very comfortable talking about about the city my background also i was the city manager over in kansas city for the last 10 months or so i had left just a little while ago just june 26th before that i was working at canals technical college the public works academy doing a lot of training for local government public works emergency management things like that before that i was working at elder beach and uh before that i was over in the city of san diego so very familiar with uh pinots county especially uh you know central pinellas down to the southern tip thank you very much um all council members have prepared questions for you so if you're ready let's begin as i call on each council member please introduce yourself to district we'll start right here with mr roberts hello pete uh my name is lloyd robertson speed okay here you go by peter oh absolutely pete okay so it looks like you've got some experience in public works hands-on as well as some teaching experience if you could take a minute or two to share with us one of the what you feel is one of the most successful public works projects that you've had an opportunity to work with and why you think it was successful okay um well obviously there's been lots of public works excuse me i'm sorry i didn't know what my video was on um okay so uh one of the public works projects i've really enjoyed doing right there in bellar beach is actually working on a lot of uh the sand dunes in the area and not just working on the standards you know for aesthetics but actually working with folks like the audubon society the clearwater marine aquarium all those agencies to make uh some of your sand dunes the most biodiverse sandings or at least when i was working there that's what we had gotten a lot of notoriety for related to that also as part of if i remember correctly i forget if there was one or two um nutrient nourishment projects uh in mellor beach and it was either one in mellor beach and two would say each i think that was the way it was or the other way around and i really enjoyed that again providing erosion protection protecting against uh storm events things like that as well as just having a beautiful environment for our residents to be able to walk around and enjoy okay just to follow up so what type of agencies did you have to work with with the uh beach residence restoration yeah um when i worked with the abuse registration uh our local contact was nicole elco i don't know if anybody remembers her name she used to be the coastal manager for pinellas county uh related to that we worked with you know state uh the state department of environmental protection we worked with the army corps of engineers again it was it was a lot of people come together to make a project like that happen okay thank you thank you mr banker uh thanks for attending this beat uh when he's right back out of the councilman uh you and one other candidate had the most diverse experience with belarus why do you feel that you'd be the best candidate in our coach um i guess so one of the things that i i feel like i'm pretty strong with i have a lot of connections in the local area um through pinellas county through the state of florida and also uh i could bring i can bring volunteers i work with several nonprofits in the area um i have a proven history of working with keep hills beautiful you know we've done things like litter surveys in the area for my volunteers to do coastal cleanups i have pretty i still have very tight uh ties to knows technical college you can bring volunteers um interns uh things like that to to assist also um like i said i've spent quite a bit of time we spent about five and i think about five and a half years in melbourne beach and still even talking to some of the residents uh out there all right just one follow-up you said you left your last job at the end of june are you presently employed um i've worked with the public works academy as well as i have my own business i restarted what i call tampa bay training again doing things like emergency management training actually just so i came from doing some training out in ellis county public works uh teaching them about safety teaching maintenance and traffic how to set up uh work zones out of industry and things like that i know also being in a small city i also know that it's really kind of a hands-on city as well uh one of the things that i really enjoyed working in melbourne beach i'd often get in your i forget the name of the the type of four build vehicle but i would drive around the streets all the time and get to know the residents you know person by person know their stories you know kind of try to try to create you know a small family atmosphere that that bellar beach needs to be in and has in my experience thank you thank you hi chief this is leslie doterra how are you doing nice to see you too um as you know you know fellow beach is unique in that it's a small community totally residential we don't have any business taxes and things like that so money is always an issue um can you give us a little information about your grant writing experience uh it's been a little bit since i've written a grant but i've been several grants like uh indeed beach if you look at the southern sand wall that they have i got a grant for that um i believe four of the beach student walkovers i did that at least one of their programs i got grants for uh i also worked with swiftman to get community education grants in the past and one of the things that i try to do is actually look at where we can take one brand and you know several different things um at the same time and what i mean community education um one of the small grants that i got in saint pete beach was a community education brand and one of the things that we used to stand for is to uh to meet a lot of our own pbs our stormwater requirements as well as to really educate the public on what public works does um more than just uh you know create print materials you know i went to the elementary school both beaches elementary school talked to the kids got them gave them a lot of information to pass to you know to their parents i had a lot of community presentations i remember kind of early in my career i had a community presentation i thought i knew everything and all of a sudden you know i'm going around the room and i found out wow this is a phd an engineer and this is a phd in uh chemistry some of the people that are blue ribbon communities and really rather than trying to talk at them kind of turned it around and created a community forum for them to talk and actually got them involved uh working with the community you know the leaders as well so again using some of the grants i've gotten from how many years of experience do you bring and what was the most responsible position in city management uh had you held in some accomplishments i started uh my internships and things like that go back into 1996 a good portion of that was in pinellas county i'm sorry i'm sorry pastor hamilton and then uh about 98.99 i made my way down to pinellas um so my history working full time started about 1990 19 000 in pinellas county uh the most i figured the word the news but the most responsible position i have you know i just left with the executive city and uh and also hillary vitros your community services and i t director um being in bellard it was really kind of an interesting time i don't know if you all remember i know it was the tire of this um when we actually took our old city hall which was kind of dilapidated and falling apart we had all kinds of uh air quality concerns inside of the facility and things like that we wind up knocking it down um working with verizon the rsu that's right next to your city hall and and finding a way for us to be able to uh you know to build the city hall where we are now uh not only do we have to do all that coordination and funding and all that but uh some of the most interesting memories i have is taking you know going from that old city hall into a single family house on the next block over and having to bring over all of the um the i.t infrastructure telephone and schools infrastructure over a weekend and after we built this city hall in one weekend having to bring it all back to this new building and and putting it all together to make it work thank you ip glenn gunn speaking [Music] you were here at miller beach from 2005 2010 2011 time frame it was a transition time because we had just moved from a strong mayor to the mayor city council former government and i'm just kind of wondering what were the things that you observed that could have been improved on and we did well that we didn't do well and if you were to come back here do you have some ideas i think you can probably take a really close look at it and perhaps maybe there's some experiences or expertise you're bringing directly from ken's city yeah actually i was hired i'm literally in that transition i read silverboard was your your first city manager and uh he recruited me from uh some accounting committees that we worked together on with the nps committee and so i was your first public works director of sorts and kind of an assistant city manager of sorts um a very interesting time um the main thing that i've learned in recent times is the importance of strategic planning and getting us all together getting a common vision keeping open communication and really bringing together many options to you all and uh and providing you all the information to uh to give the executive leadership and to pass that down to me to implement thank you very much yes dave gaddis again um right now we're in the middle of setting the next fiscal year budget and this is something that we're not really struggling with but we do encounter some issues with the entire process uh can you give me an example or maybe a rundown of what your idea of creating a budget would be like uh well it looks like you have a fair start um at a budget i don't mean start by any means i spent a couple days looking through your budget and i think it's pretty well formed um i just i really don't see a whole lot of improvement i mean by format and it looks like you're generally in good shape one of the things i'm very excited about working with the budget and until i actually you know get my hands on and get to talk to y'all you know kind of more face to face and seeing some of the issues and some of the more recent history um working with andy tess has has been a great honor of mine i've really enjoyed working with them and i really like to collaborate with them to to be able to kind of get deeper into your budget um it's like you said there's quite a few things that kind of are limiting the fact that you guys don't have businesses is kind of limiting um i think it's a great thing that you know we built to city hall and we built the city hall in such a way that we do a lot of rentals and things like that and it brings some some revenue but it is minor revenue um you know that's exciting um you're really without getting back involved and i love the opportunity to uh to to be with you guys again you know to really talk about the issues of bellar beach and to to see where we need to go with them um at this point i i really don't have a great handle on that on the outside i think you know i have one more question and uh capital projects management can you give me an example of a difficult project that you managed uh well let's see um well your city hall yours the building of your city hall was a big project that i was involved with the erection or the replacement they should say of howard avenue bridge was uh was a little bit complicated um you know during the discussions i i really was looking at making it howard edmond bridge a little bit different than um than it is now i was actually put in uh when we were designing it i can't i'm trying to think of the name uh the elite engineering i think was the company that i was working with i forget their name exactly but um we were looking at actually making it a little bit more of a decorative bridge we were looking at expanding kind of a sidewalk area that would be um being locked into the children in the area that used to do a lot of fishing in that area uh what else was uh some of the other things when i uh when i first got to miller beach i remember talking to our sitting lsus our city clerk at the time then became our city manager um is to nancy where's our all of our plans uh you know for for the um you know for howard avenue ridge when it was constructed 40 years ago she goes oh they're upstairs i go up into the public works garage at the time i mean they were just disheveled we couldn't find any plants and basically it was really difficult to you know to put that there without knowing some of the specifics on what was there and once we started doing construction uh we found out there was you know some bad techniques that were done such as uh throwing down there was a huge amount of concrete that was placed there that we had to remove and that cost an extra 25 000 at the time but uh just the idea of working with the community working with our leaders and coming to together to you know make a project like that happen you know was a wonderful opportunity to put that in there although like i said i really think we missed some opportunities to you know to to elevate that bridge where i forget how much more it would cost but it was marginal and um i think we could have made it a safer ridge we could have one that was a little bit more conducive to pedestrian traffic to fishing to uh to things like that thank you mr roberts yes so pete is lloyd again um with the town of kenneth city i know you weren't there for a long time so the time you were there what do you think was the biggest challenge you had while you were there and what skills did you use and how did you work through that challenge well one of the biggest challenges i remember coming to my first day and literally there was two professionals myself and a temporary employee and i was like okay you know this is a small staff but you know this is something we can you know move forward from and then day two or day three came about and it literally wasn't just me and the uh temporary employee at the front counter um yeah it was very difficult to basically put together a staff for a short time i feel like we were building a team together you know very close with the city clerk i brought the city clerk and when we were looking at how much that that would cost uh to get this in clerk when we went out um you know and advertised it i believe we're talking about around 84 thousand watt percent we had a budget at about 50 000 uh 50 to 60 thousand dollars um i had to scour everybody and i knew or really looked for the best person i have i couldn't get and um found annika basis at the college um she's now at the city of seminole and she's thriving in fact i i did a presentation to the mississippi alerts association last week and got to see her we're going to go to lunch not just friday friday after um really one of the things that i truly believe is to create you know i don't want to say a family environment but in small cities you know having everybody work together have honest communication have uh you know really build the team um unfortunately a couple things happened and that really forced you know a chain reaction um in fact i remember talking to you know uh you know at least several members of the council and say please you know we're in a very difficult situation as if it's unstable you've lost two entire you've lost an entire management staff a little while ago you went through two of interim city management so now you have me the biggest thing that we need is to have people comfortable in their jobs we're building people from the ground up it takes education that takes collaboration it takes a lot of communication and that was starting to happen again and within a few months it really was starting to happen and uh really some barriers started popping up that i don't really think needed to be there um i really need to you know again i really didn't feel that communication is key and um and also just uh what we call the chemistry i've always had wonderful chemistry in the city beach bella reach for some reason i didn't really have the same cognitive chemistry as for every place i've worked in i've really had a strong chemistry with except for this last city i still have some really tight relationships and still talk to several people there um regularly but um really just making sure that we're all working towards the same goal i think is very important all right was there a particular reason you decided to move on [Music] uh when i started seeing it like as i said i threw up an alarm and said you know some of the things that i'm seeing some of the decisions that i see being made are really going to create this chain reaction that that wound up happening unfortunately um yeah and that's the reason i left you know rather than prolong this situation where it wants to become more of a battle and can be quite honestly could be destructive to the city why don't i leave quietly shake hands with everybody and again do do what i do well where i do well and allow them to find you know somebody hopefully that they could find somebody that really convinced some offenses and move this it really was a difficult situation again management staffs leave within exactly one year i think that that points out something you know they really didn't need a lot of assistance i think i really should have been stronger i bring up outside help and i've talked to rob duncan which is one of the consultants that's working there now and uh he's trying to bring in some consulting in fact from what i understand next month they're going to bring in florida leave it in this right they're not part of the experience uh an outside consultant to really try to met some of the um the difficulties between council there seems to be a couple of actions and i thought you know over some time and seeing some uh some progress that now you know we can start mending and building those relationships between our accounts and at some point it seemed to to really not go that way i think in the future i'd be a lot stronger about you know when i see you know let's put it this way when you see some kind of sickness you know you've got a disease you call the doctor in it and you solve that problem right thank you and we have time for one more question and i'm going to ask you to keep your answer brief and uh and then that will conclude this year that's right [Music] to demonstrate your personal self-motivation and goal achievement i'm sorry can you repeat that sir uh where in your career can you point to demonstrate your personal self-motivation and goal achievement i don't really understand the question do you mind rephrasing it yeah um can you point out somewhere in your career that you were self-motivated enough to set a goal and achieve it okay um well um i guess just in general you know ever since i was a young man i really found the government to be so amazing and uh you know i wanted to be in my first bachelor's in political science and second bachelors in environmental science and policy in public administration and um i remember i just even interned in newport richie and in their development services department i also interned in environmental labs of pasco county public transportation and just once i started getting involved i said wow you know forget about federal government i mean you know that's kind of its interest and that's wonderful but i think i really want to work for local government and that's really been a um it's been a goal of mine and i've done that um again since the uh the late 90s so i believe that that was me finding the role uh getting into this uh this world and making myself a um a resource i talked to a lot of sitting managers i was at this sorry fccma's professional development professional development uh committee today uh being volunteering for the strategic planning community to uh to again to to bring education to work to imagine the community so again the idea of getting involved with city government and all levels from education training uh collaboration just being the general resource has been my goal and quite honestly i feel like i met that and i continue to move that thank you very much we're out of time uh very nice to meet you and uh we appreciate your interest in the city manager position we will contact you tomorrow sounds wonderful it's a pleasure meeting and seeing you all thank you very much [Music] all right we have about 10 minutes if anyone would like to discuss departure from kansas city but i'm gathered would it be a stretch randy you had some experience at kansas city can you give us any background on the climate there better question i will speak to the candidate as i think you folks should handle that and reach your own conclusions as to the general question pose the climate there i would say that it certainly was a a municipality in transition um simple facts in april of 2021 at the time they had a manager a clerk and uh two personnel full-time personnel in town hall by by may 2021 all four of those people were gone within a month of each other i was a town attorney at the time we worked through the league of cities to recruit an interim manager that interim manager came they had been interviewing in multiple positions and one of those positions came through while they were the interim and then they left within their first 45 days or so and so they went through about three or four managers in 2021 culminating in mr quality selection in august of 2021 and then the clerk's election in september of 2021 i don't think i'm saying anything out of turn to say that there are differences of opinion on the council as to how the manager council form of government should work what is guidance versus what is interference versus you know and then there are differing narratives on that and i'm not characterizing any one person's conclusions but that created some dissonance and tension and ultimately by by the spring of this year early summer their manager voluntarily separated from employment they're clerk voluntarily separated from employment and their attorney separated from employment i've been there nine years i've just you know gone through that transition a year prior um so ultimately i think that they there's a lot of challenges in that community that you know some internal some external and i've said that in public records so i'm not saying anything in that term but i would just say that it's uh you know i would also caution just generally speaking um the league of cities when it publishes materials on managers says that the average tenure in the state of florida is anywhere from four to six years in any one place and four years is typically it's a pretty decent run manager departures and attorney departure charter official departures tend to be seven often following elections um and so that's not without precedent you can draw whatever conclusions you wish to just give you that contest thank you very much any other comments um i know it's a difficult format uh you know 20 minutes but what i was getting he wasn't very focused he wasn't you know he can answer a question but he wasn't leading toward a goal and an interview you should drive it around okay this is what i have done and this is how i did it so it's an issue i can work your problem doing the following doing x you talk about writing contracts i have for the grant process she said yes i have submitted 20 grants out of 20 there was one and what i was afraid to do is the society reported that it just seems very it was passive and not focused it seemed to me that the interview just lacked content it was a lot of filler in it and he didn't seem to have the focus or really any accomplishments that he would brag on he would say yeah i know this um i don't know what his role would have been in the construction of this building but it certainly doesn't yeah know um before um very capable um very easy guy to work with and so and he did a lot here as far as working on the future nourishment project um that was beautiful and stuff like that i was not unhappy with his answers to the grant questions and budgeting and things like that okay why is i mean um insurance you know try to brag on yourself it's really hard to do you gave him an opportunity look tell me the word demonstrated self motivation in a cold and i kind of didn't understand the question which is the first you know object in my mind well i rewarded this a few times see what you come up with and it didn't really the answer he got you know wanted to pursue mastery because i like administration all right we've got about two minutes and then we will start the next conference which is where mr riegler so i think i'm good is we're here hey you're gonna have to unmute you hear me yes can you hear us yes all right next candidate is mr kyle welcome mr riegler and thank you for joining us i believe very nice to meet you again and uh would you please give us a brief introduction for the council okay my name is kyle reedler i've worked for the city of valley beach for four years i've been in charge of public works where i started after that i assumed the role of assistant city manager working for mr munrees i under his guns i learned the ins and outs of almost all facets of the city and i believe i'm very qualified for this job thank you very much uh we're going to uh start this time with vice mayor gunn and ask some questions going this way hi kyle uh easy named and change one thing what would it be i would like to increase the level of understanding what the residents want um i'd like to develop a better reporting process so that we can analyze what what it is that is most important to the residents and then be able to be able to deliver on it and ultimately whenever something comes in question being able to answer why we do what we do mike okay what makes you stand out from this field of experienced city managers and candidates with advanced degrees and 20-plus years of experience why should we hire you the reason i stand out is because i'm a certified flood plan manager 100 another beach is in the flood zone so everything that goes on in the city is related to flood in some way form or another it's very important that you understand that when you're looking at construction when you're approving permits at the same time i'm familiar with two years go around of crs certification that's also important because it provides them with twenty percent discounted flood insurance thank you nicely i can't it's leslie notaro you talked a lot about the flooding on the side streets and the infrastructure and stuff what is your idea for the beach side of the city what would you order what would your plans be for that to protect the property on the beach side um i think it is important to support our treatment system on the beach side um to encourage um not not destroying the engine to let them build up because they're a natural barrier to defense when a hurricane comes in another thing would be to just make sure that the management of the beach is is correct or people are following the rules because that's a lot of what people on the beach side have to deal with is all that beachfront property um you've been with us for four years you've been the assistant city manager for at least one you've been actually men's right-hand what tests have you confronted that you can't have with this job i mean you know this like i said you've been here for four years you've probably done everything from getting involved in underground lighting storm water paving beach i'm just asking you what what do you believe you can't handle or haven't failed to i haven't run into anything i can't handle i've been fortunate enough to be in the interim position where i've come across a lot of things i haven't done directly um as far as for example like just uh testifying in a public hearing for a code enforcement also uh dealing more directly with the budget uh getting directly involved in code enforcement as far as the nurses and violations um also i've come across emergency management i'm directly involved with that uh i've taken over reigns on the crms program i've been doing that for two years going around and answer questions flood flood plain questions to residents approving permits understanding the code and how it applies to construction and study dealing directly with the residents communicating with them and meeting their expectations the best visibility of the city um given whatever the situation is so so far uh it's been a learning experience where i continue to constantly improve what i do but i haven't come across anything that i really couldn't handle hi kyle's lloyd how are you great how are you good so we've had a couple of discussions about public works projects and things like that the short time i've been here which is good so if you can share with us not all public works projects typically go perfectly it's just not the nature of that area so if you could share um a particular project that you've been involved with that met that criteria where there was some challenges throughout what were those challenges what was the project what were the challenges what did you do to work through those and at the end of the day you walked away saying wow that worked out well well with the star water program i started getting involved we started but we did uh third fourth fifth and sixth street um but those projects comes to mind is when uh when you're when you're digging up hype and you run into something that the engineers didn't know it was there and you had to figure out in the field when you have installed a conflict box of some sort that deal with a ladder will come into a property so it's kind of like thinking on your feet working with the contractor and uh coming up with the best solution for the problem so it's always nothing is set um it goes perfectly so it's it's always something you have to make adjustments along the way a lot of times towards the end of the project when you're doing the plug sheets just to make sure everything's completed when you find things that you're not satisfied with so you have to go back to the contractor and work with them to get to the point of a level of expectation okay were there any any of those projects you just referenced where there was a change order involved and and you recall any of those and how we actually work through those as a city to determine whether or not you felt like the change order cost that they presented to you in the city and how you dealt with that well we in the past three projects we stayed within budget um so we did not have to do a change on it there's a contingency built into the project itself um but we're thinking back i don't even think we've touched the contingency we did it was slightly um a lot of times there's other things in the project as long as you're doing the accounting of what the contractor is actually doing in the quantities uh sometimes you'll find that they don't actually fulfill all the quantities that are in the plan so there is room um sometimes for extra money to move from one item to another okay thank you hi kyle um you've worked with lynn reeves for quite a few years now you called him over from oldsmar in fact is that correct correct yes okay so did you work for lynn athol tomorrow also yes okay all right great what would be the difference in your management style versus lynn reeves the difference is um i would say just for a generational difference i think i'm uh definitely a little bit more inclined to use technology but to try newer ideas uh has a lot of experience in a lot of different areas uh but i think being so the use of technology is a little bit more uh appealing to me um and being kind of coming up to date with how things have changed in different fields of the job okay i'm going to ask you one more question and then i'll pass the tours here if you were hired as city manager what would be your top five priorities top five priorities uh one of my first priorities would be to hire my current position to uh field asset delegation of an important reporting procedures and on the ground management that's needed that are kind of important both right now um next priority would be depending on when you make a decision getting us through this budget year and getting to the start of the next one i'd like to start early on next year's budget and rethinking kind of how we do things based on our discussions this year following that like i said in the reporting process i'd like to get more feedback from from the code enforcement and what the residents are are asking on us to do and to try and prioritize what this will support so that we can focus our efforts towards getting what their needs are fourth changing the way we do our smallmouth projects we came across a project this year where um you know we kind of like wanted to analyze more we didn't quite get to we weren't early enough on stage so moving forward we got the next projects uh 1738 i've already working on getting the data that we need to really look at consider how how we may be able to prioritize what's important move our money the best spend it um to get the most effect for that project and uh i would like to oh adjust our bidding process kind of goes hand in hand with the budget i would like to make sure we have adequate funds budgeted for projects so we're not going in possibly being underfunded i want realistic budget numbers and then at the same time i want to tweak our bidding process slightly to possibly with the stormwater projects to give an option to of a higher stack of job um to see that to really be able to make out and not tie ourselves down to the lowest building bidder to really way out um is this contractor going to be delivered by the product is it worth the extra money to achieve the better product because we you know we're spending a lot of money to begin with make sure we do it right thank you miss rifler mr good all of those things those five points you just made were those communicated to they raised did you try to put those into motion while you were working for liberty i mean you talk about this this generational kind of thing and maybe there's a difference in division where you want to go but i mean so so you had a vision of some things you wanted to fix or try to improve upon my question is did you try to put those into motion as an assistant city manager and how did that work um at any point where we were looking to gather more data for a project i jumped all over using technology so it's definitely something i embraced with given the opportunity direction from wind um being in charge of myself i i would probably just do more of it um and again kind of just from this last past year some of the some of the issues we're dealing with when it comes to inflation and really kind of analyzing our projects and that is motivating me to do so might say well uh yeah kyle how would you improve our strategic plan uh to prove it i mean i think that going through the process more often than not throughout the year it's important to ensure that um that we are sticking to what is most important in our objectives and the projects that we're completing are satisfying the strategic plan um the more you bring it up the more possibly you can get feedback from residents that are attending meetings or at least aware of it um just to find out maybe there's some tweaks i'd say the strategic plan mostly analysis and find out what's most important to them and then adjust it accordingly thank you let's move to toro i have no other questions i call you you've been privileged to be a celebrity followers a council person mentioned last night which um total agreement could actually be worked out to come up with a project that you can explain in five minutes you think you're capable of putting something like that together i definitely think we're capable of i think it's a matter of working through the numbers finding out what's most important what do people want to see and know when you're explaining the budget um and then dumping it down so to speak i mean to a simpler document to just that ties back into the main knot and uh it's as deep as you want to dive into it we can thank you for so kyle i've noticed on many of our requests for bids that we put out there we don't really have too many contractors that respond obviously that's not great for the city because we need to create competition out there i'm assuming that most of these contracts would go out we also have pre-bid meetings so when the contractors come in and i'm a contractor and brexit contractor we're the only two contractors in there um that's not a great situation because i kind of know you know frank fitz and he knows how i did so we're probably not going to get the lowest bid so do you have any ideas and or thoughts as to what the city can do to increase the number of contractors that are going to participate in our request for bids so a lot of times when we do send out our solicitations we send it to everybody that we've worked with in the past we advertise in the newspaper at the same time you get a lot of companies that do jump all over buying the information for the bid so they're kind of remarketing it for us but it as it's shown hasn't really produced great results um in my mind i think i could reach out to other cities find out if there's local contractors if you want someone you want them continuous you want them global you don't want them going too far across the state but to get a deeper pool of the contractors in the area and get getting interest so that they do get okay kyle um can you give me some examples of working with both the state and federal governments um i rejected the state we have our own doing a grant or fulfilling grant requirements i also work with the state when it comes to fdep requirements for our permitting our ms4 which we complete every year for our stormwater system um federal government mostly most things that who go to the feds do go through the state they're kind of like the in between uh conduit uh federal government uh i would say fema directly most of my female classes are related straight from federal government and guidance um so anytime you need advice uh questions about flood plain management if you do contact that level i'm just curious have you ever had to deal with the army corps of engineers i have not dealt directly with the army corps of engineers i come from a profession where confidence does not necessarily equate to competence so a concern that i had is when we're dealing with budgets capital planning projects my fear is group think kind of stuff i mean what i mean by that is you followed lynn reeves down here and he worked in his mentorship all this time so my concern is we don't know what we don't know so the question to you is you know how do we explore other ways of doing the budget how do we explore other ways of managing capital projects do you see my concern here is that it's the broadness and exposure to other ideas the way other cities do it not just hey this is the way you've always done it here because that's the way we did it up in oldsmar that's the way we've always done it in bellaire beach i guess my concern is how is it done in other places and are are we able to open up our lines together i guess i need a little convincing for you that that's a possibility if i explain that sufficiently yeah um i guess i can say that uh my management of capital projects um has been based on my experience on some of it's directly within but i also have worked projects that were under land but i had to deal with the state in the state level of inspection so i do know inspection and project management on a different level it's a satisfying grant and requirements are higher that we are keeping track of more data to make sure that you know the specs are being had at the same time when it comes to budget processing and capital projects it's a tight network um in the palace county area so there's a lot of people to ask questions too a lot of things you can compare and especially when it comes to some of the budget and briefs and things that you're looking at from other cities that's one thing government you find all the time is people asking other officials in government how they do it and sharing information thank you mr riefler we appreciate your interest in the city manager position uh we're out of time as you know you set the schedule uh we appreciate it and uh we'll give you an update tomorrow thank you sounds great thank you place okay everyone uh so we've just interviewed kyle riefler i opened his comments now let's just go ahead and start with honestly i like to wait until we've got all the candidates like kind of compare different skill sets before i think everybody is going to fit into this i think he [Music] had good he was well prepared i think for the questions that we asked today i feel like i don't think it was brought out for somebody that they could just compare the experience and the certifications and within the city manager type of a position i think on paper so far there are candidates that are far ahead so that's something to take into account i believe in the equation and we'll see how your candidates do thank you right thank you um i think he answered all the questions very directly to get like the latest candy i think he's got the experience of four years here under a good city manager with what lloyd said with other people who have experience in management management and degrees and then whereas his background was in the parking lot it's hard to compare him to everybody and i'll remind everyone after we interview the last candidate we'll take a break and then we'll come back meet again and then we will have a discussion and maybe a lively debate and then we'll basically take it to mike savers yeah looking at my personal experience with the leadership there's been poor leaders and great leaders and what really concerns me is he's been a one supervisor for his whole professional alliance since 2006 and never had the ability to reach out to other mentors or to be mentored by other competing ideas and he talked about he had a generational conflict that he was technology already well it would have been really very first professional development to have had another mentor that maybe he's different so he had a different set of influence unfortunately when you're in metro relationship since 2006 that's you're kind of almost getting a light in mind unfortunately mike makes a good point on that i thought he was direct or well prepared i think i trust you my last question my concerns there is also leslie touched on it there i mean if you kind of look at everything in the mix of qualifications and certifications there are people abundantly more qualified today a follow-on to mike's thinking i think is during those last four years has there been any motivation towards greater professional development certifications certified public accounting and from my perspective that was the perfect interview for someone that didn't sit in all of our meetings every time the door was loaded he knew exactly how to answer the questions because these are topics that we're constantly discussing but on the as far as the experience goes if whenever i look at the various resumes and applications uh he's a very young very young person and i don't mean that by age i mean young in the profession definitely i'll keep my eye on it and we'll see where it goes any other comments frankly um yes you can have a ballot and we'll just leave it on the basket facebook i think that that's fair enough thank you you know peggy would you make a note let's just say at 6 40 i did not see her signing and i don't know if she's listening on the phone thank you very much and the next interview begins minutes you're stretching what's up okay so [Music] okay all right everyone the final candidate is mr robert daniels welcome mr daniels and thank you for joining us my name is dave gaddis i'm the maker of bellar beach it's very nice to meet you would you like to start off by giving us a brief introduction i'm sorry mr daniels we cannot hear you probably can you hear us he can hear us he's still working out the mute edition there we go can you hear me now yes sir thank you very much um before we begin do you prefer to hear by bob or robert all right the legal name's robert but uh all my friends call me bob so all right would you like to give us a brief introduction sure uh first off i want to thank all of you for uh taking your time out your day to give me this interview i'm definitely looking forward to being back over on the west coast of florida and it's a great opportunity that uh you've afforded me to commit an interview and uh hopefully and give a run for the money with the other candidates but i think in the long run uh you can see i've got a proven record of managing in madeira beach um i've worked a lot of hard projects and we were able to bring bring them to success and you know most of my career i was in law enforcement uh primarily uh worked my way up through the chain of command in boca raton and retired as an assistant chief and then i was chief of police in a number of jurisdictions uh again picking up little pieces of experience along the way and not only running the police department but also being a key figure in the city government then i kind of found my niche i like working in smaller cities because you tend to get to be able to develop one-on-one relationships with individuals even as busy as madeira beach was you know there was still a lot of the residents that i got a chance to meet with and develop friendships with and i think that's kind of important having a channel of communication that's direct with the residents after all they're you know they're the ones that have a lot invested and you know there's a lot of long-term residents in all of the coastline cities uh in pinellas county so i think that's what's interesting i'm a big history buff so well learning about what life was like uh in say bel air beach you know in the 40s uh and you know just kind of working your way up it's just really interesting uh grasping that so one of the things i instituted in madura beach and i'll be very brief because i know i don't you all only have 20 minutes scheduled so but just having that communication on a monthly basis at least where we would go out to a particular location whether it be a homeowners association group or whatever and have what we call breakfast with bob and it's kind of a road show but i think it's important that we don't expect everybody to come to city hall i think we need to be able to go to them and i think that's kind of that smaller community spirit that i like to foster and you know whether you're a city manager or whoever you are within the city it's nice to have that personal touch with individuals thank you very much we'll start off the question with boyd roberts hi bob my name is lloyd roberts how are you great how are you doing wonderful i did notice on your resume that uh this is when you were with the town of melbourne beach that you uh were involved with rehabilitating your storm water utility system but even more importantly that you were working with fema to get a grant could you expand on that particular project and where it started and how it ended uh fema has had throughout the years mitigation grant so uh obviously we during one of the storms that they had an exposure uh to storm water and roadway collapse and then kind of you know that all really happened just before i came on board but we took it a step further and we did some analysis on what our needs were throughout the whole town and um then we wrote up a proposal for fema and with the i had some grant writers that assisted us at the college level and uh between that and our partners with uh keep brevard beautiful which is you know kind of that piece and looking at the sustainability aspect and uh we're successful in uh getting it covered uh i think is roughly about 1.1 million is what we were able to get reimbursed for it was a reimbursement grant so we had to come up with the money out of our reserves first and uh but they reimbursed pretty quickly that's wonderful thank you bracelet [Music] hello my name is leslie notaro the question i'm going to ask you to sort of covered in your um opening statement madeira beach versus bellar beach we are unique in that we are totally residential what reference do you see between in being a manager of a town like madeira beach versus a small town like bel air beach which is all residential right in melbourne beach they had a small business district but uh when it was in melbourne beach but it was primarily residential and they didn't really want business you know then a1a and you know so you can't really keep people away from the commercial sites but they really didn't focus on having a business district or downtown so and again it's it's a matter of what that community climate is and um you know so that's kind of what we work with you know in melbourne beach had a couple restaurants but you know you could drive a mile and a half north and you'd have a whole row of restaurants that weren't in our jurisdiction so and the residents kind of liked it that way it was kind of low-key after about eight o'clock things started to slow down and aside from having a1a come through the center of the the town you know but even that traffic started to get white because there was nothing really for anybody to drive to unless there they're a resident of our town or the county area that was to the south of us so again i just think it's a different focus uh you know in melbourne beach we did have tourism that we work with and the businesses and everything else but you know that just gives us more energies to spend on the other things that are important like you know sustainability and you know looking at how we address the sea level rise issues and and you know drawing up the stormwater systems and all those type of things so it's not that it's it's a slower pace i think but you have more time to uh get and interact with the residents and get out there you know bring that magnetic attraction from the seat of your chair to the seat of your pants and get out and walk around and that's kind of the way i like to manage anyhow not you know necessarily being behind a desk all the time i know you know when you have a smaller staff you're counting on and doing more than the nuts and bolts administrative and that's fine that's the way it was in melbourne beach as well but you know i got out and worked on some of the public works projects and we uh rebuilt our gazebo and did a number of things just with the staff of public works i was there swinging the hammer as well thank you about the mike table um i mean i got to tell you with your resume and we're looking at cities melbourne 3101 uh 7 000 north grill 3 800 madura beach we're only 1472. frankly we're kind of on the poor end of the scale you know we don't have a big budget um of all the places i mean i saw your career you look like you're going up why are you kind of stepping back for a small place like bellar beach well like i said i kind of like smaller communities you know it gives you more chance to get involved with the grassroots and what's going on gives you more time to interact with the commission or the council and uh you know so you know those are things that i really enjoy um i i don't need the hustle and bustle with you know working and obviously i spent a lot of time in boca raton and then as a as a manager working down in north bay village and then you know but nothing beach was good and then you know to me bellar beach is just a treasure you know it really is and to be able to to work there is just you know something i could do for the rest of my life okay and follow up uh advocacy the city managers what's your code enforcement method how do you prefer doing code enforcements well you know we've done it both ways i had when i was in melbourne beach i hired a part-time coat officer that we had and they primarily worked in the evenings and on the weekends kind of fluctuated their 20 hours that they had and then you know when we were in when i was in madeira beach we had the sheriff's office with two community service officers that also handled our code enforcement and in getting back to north bay village we had one full-time individual that dealt with the code issues so i think you kind of mesh what your problems are what your needs are and you try to get involved in that and a lot of times even in madeira beach i got involved in code issues because you still didn't have an officer on all the time and i just happened to always be around so well not just happening but but you know you're there and sometimes you can resolve an issue better than anybody else and that's what i'm trying to do thank you i swear done the uh i think mike's able touched on it the size of the beach is a concern there are homeowners associations bigger than us condo associations bigger than the city of baylor beach we have a very thin very broad we have a broad skill set but very thin depth of skills support our staffers very few people are there spread in here my concern is that we don't know but we don't know sometimes and i look through your qualifications the empa certified government financial manager icma credential manager i think that's that's important so uh i guess my question is if i look towards people with experience in other municipalities other government agencies because i kind of like this this idea of cross-pollination and bringing ideas from outside i'm always concerned about improvement and tunnel vision and again we don't know what we don't know so with respect to budgets and capital planning and products that sort of thing how do you intend to capitalize on those experiences in other municipalities and your credentials that can benefit each well you know a lot of times you can pick up from items that you've done in another jurisdiction so revenue sources are always a big thing that you can look at um and legislative uh allocations we were we became very successful that with using linda chaney the state representative that covered our area too but you know and doing those efforts that we needed to do and writing up the applications and sometimes you got turned down but you know it never stopped us from asking for the money to get done with the projects that we needed to do and i think the key thing right now is sustainability that's an important issue so anything that we can couch towards sustainability and from my colleagues that i've spoken to and from the items that i've been reading that's really where the important dollar is going to be you know we look at security and law enforcement those type of things but i think we're more pertaining uh to bellaire beach is just going to be what are we going to do to better mitigate those problems that we have from sea level rise and some sustainability issues so uh bellar beach will be there a hundred years from now and you know and that was kind of i think when you deal with a smaller town it's easier for people to understand that as you get larger cities um it's it's not so i think your city you know although like you said it's smaller than you know some of the places that i've worked in but it's i think it's there's a lot that we can get done and we have to do it together you know those homeowners associations and condo associations you know we have to get buy it from them and that's my job you know i know you all do your part uh as being the governing body but it's my job to make sure that we get the day-to-day buy-in from what we want to accomplish thank you very much hi bob it's uh dave again i uh i noticed that you know all about how small we are but can you tell me what research have you done on bellaire beach what do you know about us well um i know your previous manager was very involved with that same communication that i've been able to develop with the county level and maybe not barry as much but you know with chill and i think you all are very progressive in addressing stormwater situations and coming out with a strategic plan that's very important sometimes when i talk about strategic planning everybody all of a sudden says well you know i gotta go or you know everybody drops off so i think those are important items that you have in your tool chest because you have to know number one where you are before you know where you want to go and it sounds to me like from 2019 and on you all have been working at that you know from an outsider's point of view i find that very encouraging because a lot of times uh elected officials deal with a budget you know we have a year but really strategically we have to look what we're going to be doing in the future and really having a sustainability plan in the future or some of the items that i see that we can work on together and come up with some strategies that we need to uh to survive thank you very much wood roberts hey bob it's lloyd again so i have a very good childhood friend who was the city manager in the city in texas for 34 consecutive years which is unbelievable so i called him and we knew we were going to look for city manager and through the conversation at some point he shared with me that we know lloyd fire police chiefs he has found out do very well in a city manager opportunity why do you think that is i think because you know right away you're dealing with somebody that's got a value set and you know it usually centers around being honest being ethical uh and moral and you know those are three things that i've used as my value set you know uh my son's an eagle scout and so we work through the whole scouting program with him now he's 20 years old at the university of alabama but that's just an example i think i think we're more value driven on doing what's right for the right reason at the right time and also uh law enforcement teaches you to do a lot of self-reflection um you know there's many days that you know i made decisions as a chief of police and some of them might have been personnel decisions some of them might have been budget decisions and and even as a city manager and i would try um on my drive home because you never really get a chance to have quiet sometimes so on my drive home i would reflect okay what were the good things that we accomplished today and what were the things that we could tweak a little bit and i think a lot of law enforcement officers you know even like ashamed of what occurred in the elementary school in texas but you know they always look and reflect on things whether it's good or bad they look how to address it if it's good how can we make it better and i think you know having that mentality as a manager i think is very helpful because you know i i don't have an ego you know uh you know i've learned long ago your ego can't get bigger than anybody else's so you know i'm used to just kind of working at the service level but being a manager that's going to lead and when something goes wrong and i'm not perfect if i make a mistake you all are going to be the first ones to know about it and i think that's part of the thing of having a police chief because they're going to be straight up with you they're going to be honest and i think that's what you need particularly in a smaller jurisdiction because one thing leaking out could have a disastrous effect and so if you're honest and you're truthful all along uh i don't think you can go wrong well thank you for that answer bob you had me all the way up to the fact that your son went to alabama and i both graduated from auburn so we're gonna have to work that out yeah we'll work that out you know the iron pool is always a good deal all right thanks all right uh mr daniels we're out of time boy that was a past 20 minutes um i'm trying to keep it short too mayor but i get to talking sometimes i apologize uh no apology necessary uh we appreciate your interest in the city manager position and uh someone will be contacting you tomorrow to let you know how things wound up at the end of this meeting all right okay very great and have a good evening now it's a pleasure meeting all of you and if you have any other further questions feel free to give me a call thank you for your time have a good night okay uh i i thought that was a very excellent uh energy person very focused very professional in his own words okay besides just the qualifications and the certifications that answers my concerns about the cross-pollination issue but in his own words things like never stop asking for the money he used the word together and he talked about this value set as a former law enforcement officer those three things are just i mean you know the seem to be right there i hope those were very important to this point i thought it's very because it meant that we were engaged he was direct and we were engaged in what he was talking about and we're kind of prodding them for answers things that stood out he said i talked to my peer community never heard that from you know former city manager it's like i we've always kind of pushed and said and you talked to bel air what is indian rocks doing and he does that correctly he's reaching out to his peer community of fellow city managers um he believes in strategic plans you know he said you got to know where you're at so you know where to go um community game was two things that really stood out it's the mom's you know breakfast love and the understatement that he's the fragment he's the person that goes to the condo association not us he's the face so again yeah like everybody else i'm very impressed thank you very familiarity much a small town like bellar beach based on his experience in melbourne beach and it was very positive i think i think as a group we all ask very good questions with him as well very open-ended questions and he would just take that question and speak for a while like you said that's why we were so engaged because it was interesting to hear what he said and how he answered the question so i thought he did a great job and so far i i would have to agree with his qualifications his experience he knew exactly what to say and it wasn't just it was a legitimate real answer from experience very very good interview any other comments um yeah we do a back and forth with the city managers as council members and all the candidates so far that's the one i feel comfortable with asking a question and getting a answer based on experience uh law and there's one other point that i needed to drive home is when we took our course they said there was people there that actively pursued their state wrap phone went down and saw and that's how you get the money you get in their ear and they will take care of you too often they don't hear from the city and he's actively doing that and that's definitely one of the things that all of these communities in this area are lacking on is we can't figure out how to get funding for projects sometimes you have to be a phone in someone's side to make things happen you get to sit down and tell me how to tell them hey we need help so i guess in my mind the elephant in the room is figuring peaches losses possibly our game the question is is why did it base this opportunity i mean it went through the hiring process i know a little bit of a back story um uh but i don't know if am i allowed to discuss it iranian i know a little bit no i heard the question um whether you're allowed to discuss it uh whatever knowledge you have can be shared certainly if it's derived from you know most especially i would say if it's derived from public sources or publicly available information if you're concerned about not prejudicing the candidate you may wish to depending on how you're tracking you may wish to say if that's a question we're interested in we'll see you at the next round but it's either way it's your it's your prerogative as to how you choose to proceed i i think that uh i would like to if he advances to the next round maybe we can address some of these topics at that time i i really don't want to explain it one way or the other beyond the knowledge that i have first tonight any other comments or would anyone want to take a two to three minute break great all right she had a six o'clock meeting oh okay all right [Music] okay and that's why i encouraged her to be here okay let's stop discussing the process and take a break is that where you're from no i'm a florida board born and raised my wife is as well but her parents are from new england okay and they have uh in the family's vacation house my wife's virtually every song [Music] yes good uh is this afternoon griffin yes this is mayor this is uh dave gaddis city of miller hey mayor gaddis nice to talk with you i'll put you on speaker phone okay well we've got you all speaker phone loud and clear well that's good well thank you for hanging in there too it's been a long day for you i'm sure and uh i really appreciate you uh bringing me at the end uh it's a pleasure to talk with each of you okay so um would you like to go ahead and give us a brief introduction well i've been blessed to have a productive energetic career being a city county manager a city engineer public works director utility director for a number of years [Music] much of that experience has been in florida i've been blessed to work with great city council so you know over the years we've accomplished tremendous things it's amazing what you can accomplish when you work together and you work hard i am icma certified credentialed city county manager i'm a national incident management certified i'm a registered professional engineer in seven states uh including florida among other things and i am serving as a consulting engineer now i'm a senior engineer project manager with uh a large engineering firm that is getting started in florida but uh be honest with you i miss municipal work very much and uh when i read your opportunity and the things that you have on your plate that you'd like to accomplish i am truly interested in joining you working with you working for you and with the staff and accomplishing all that you envision thank you very much all the council members have prepared questions for you so if you're ready uh we're going to begin uh we're going to start off with uh glenn please introduce yourself and start your question good evening ken thank you very much for your time glenn gunn on this end here your your credentials are very impressive i put a lot of emphasis on the icma credentialed city manager and professional engineer aspect of your experience a concern that i would have is you bring a lot to this city with those that experience in your credentials here but is it something that you will tend to focus all your energies in in the engineering side to the exclusion of all some of the other things that are going on communications is a big thing for us and engagement with our presidents uh budgeting absolutely and uh your uh to the your credentials of vice mayor and uh and the rest of the council is are also equally impressive it would be honored to to work for you and work with you no i would not be doing any any more engineering work for the consulting firm my engineering work would be that would be for you uh you and our and our good residents are good citizens um and so uh i bring a lot of energy enthusiasm a lot of experience and i know that we can accomplish an awful lot it's a great opportunity it's a wonderful city thank you um yeah i am mike sable here looked at your uh background have you worked with the army corps of engineers uh you you have but in my in my areas you can see what i've done that you have no choice but to work with the army corps of engineers now they control the permitting much of the permitting for many of the things that you need to do and have to get done so you need to satisfy the army corps of engineers to pull your permits be able to conduct your needed projects and needed work but it's a good thing i've had a very good relationship with the army corps of engineers over the years they're a lot of very talented very dedicated engineers and so it's been a real positive working relationship and yes i'm comfortable doing that they're also they're also a great source for money too and there's a number of wonderful grant programs they have available and i've tapped into those over the years with a lot of success that's a good one why don't you follow up on that because we're a very small community we really don't have outside sources of money tell me how you go about getting that money from other sources a number a number of ways um you certainly develop a relationship with um with the the officials the the working staff for those state and federal agencies i've also been worked very well through our elected officials at the state and the federal level and you uh you help you make requests but you also have a clear idea of what's possible what the direct what the program is you'd really like to access and you do a lot of the leg work for the legislator for the staff to help it move in that direction and you uh and you deliver deliver on time and on budget with your projects and and take time to give credit where credit's due and celebrate that success um give you an example for instance when i was brought into up into mississippi they had the largest water agents in mississippi the pearl river valley water supply district we were we were also the largest developer and still the largest developer in the state of mississippi we developed 50 communities along with 50 park and recreation facilities boat launches golf courses et cetera around this 45 mile long reservoir in the heart of mississippi um three days after i accepted the position the board president earl walker called me up and said ken you know there's something we haven't told you um he said we have no vision and and we're broke he said our entire capital program for this very large entity is 200 000 that covers everything all the roads all the sewers all the parks recreation facilities everything we need you to help us secure funding and so for that little agency that we had uh we had a budget of time like 12 million dollars when i when i started and went left it was about 16 million we we secured 50 million dollars in outside funding in grants appropriations partnerships with the public in the private sector and accomplished amazing things that otherwise would have been totally impossible like doing that well thank you um mr griffin my name is leslie notaro um leslie leslie nice to meet you nice to meet you too sir looking through your resume and stuff it appears that you've been working with large cities counties large entities as you know bellar beach is a very small entity totally residential what challenges do you see working in that environment as opposed to some of the other organizations you've worked with well i think that the challenges i think is an opportunity where you get to not only work with the with the council to envision what needs to be done but you actually get to do it yourself uh because you're you're a good part of the workforce that's going to do what the council and the public envision and yes i have worked with hillsborough county which is which is unbelievably huge and frankly that was the shock so most of the entities i've worked with have been on the smaller side king william county as a county administrator from all the departments all the employees that was a hundred that was a hundred employees total we had a population of about fourteen uh fourteen thousand uh when i was uh utility director electric water and wastewater for smithfield north carolina we were a small community a community of about 10 000 i realized those were a little bigger and even the agency i mentioned in mississippi we had a total of just just a hundred staff um so most of what my work has been with smaller communities and i like the hands-on work uh that's an opportunity to uh to really get the job done you gotta jump in there and do it yourself and work with our good team thank you i can my name is lloyd roberts how are you today i'm very good oh thank you i yes i saw i saw your picture and read a little bit about you oh absolutely appreciate that so going back to the county administrative position so that that was actually great information so the king william county what was the number of um citizens there in the county in hillsborough county or king william king william county was a very small county about 12 000 residents at the time okay so yeah to some of the more engineering type opportunities you had what did you enjoy most working in the environment of more of a county administrator type role as opposed to leading a large engineering opportunity i enjoy getting projects done now i enjoy the process of developing a vision a plan a strategy with a council with the citizens with the staff and then moving forward to find the financial resources the grants and appropriations to make it much easier and much more possible to do and then moving through the obstacles and getting those visions and those projects uh done on time and on budget and we see our citizens enjoying them that's what that's what really makes me smile excellent thank you mr griffin um belarus beach is smaller much much smaller than any of the communities you've ever worked in even though some of them seem to be small we have no businesses most of our utilities are outsourced right is there a possibility that you would get here and be bored no because uh there aren't many of us to do the good work that needs to be done so i would uh just the opposite i would be uh quite busy quite quite energized you know and give you an idea you know i mentioned smithfield a little larger for instance but you know my budget for the three utilities electric water and wastewater and you know how expensive electricity is even with those budgets that we were we were very similar to what your budget is and very hands-on as well in that situation okay [Music] what research have you done on belair beach well i've read about as much as i can about each of you i've read about what some of the priorities are i've read about some of the recent challenges i've read the budget the the draft budget that you considered the other day you know i could talk about what some of those those issues are that i understand that in fact i was going to ask you some questions later on about them but you know i certainly have read about and understand about west bay drive talk about understand about issues about sea level rise and the state's initiatives on vulnerability assessment but also the tremendous amount of grant funding that's available read about your issues about your concerns about beach renourishment concerns about crs rating improvements those are some of the things that i've read i've read about the great recreational opportunities that you have covering the full breadth of of citizen interests and that's very impressive thank you very much clean gun i'm looking at your experience in king william county and you you emphasize uh how you reduce the county budget county general fund tax rates you said you looked through our budget one of the things i would be a big proponent of is bringing someone in who's worked in other counties and municipalities and had the opportunity to work with other people's budgets and how they analyze that you took a quick look at our budget did anything stand out where where do you look where would you go to in a budget to get the biggest return on the time you spend analyzing the merchant i you know i that didn't come through all that clear but i think you were saying where would i go to find the additional funds that we would need to accomplish what your vision is is that the sense well more so where would you look at our budget to to trim excess fat and i use that term very poorly to trim areas that might have a lower priority than other things are there particular areas of the budget that you would focus in on for the biggest return on the time you spent analyzing the budget well i i did you know i probably don't know enough about about the city at this stage um i did nothing jumped out at me as i i read every single line of the budget i didn't see any i didn't see anything to me that that spoke of waste i i'm sure there were tough decisions that that you had to make and i'm sure that you know to do some of the things that you'd like to do it's going to take outside grant and appropriation funding and i'm up to that challenge thank you yeah i read through and i'm looking at paris island especially groundwater everything about those times i mean i guess there's lawsuits right now with cancer in that water but can you provide an example of a time when you've had to implement a controversial policy decision and how did you handle the public reaction well we you know we it's wonderful we get to operate operate in the public um the public forum and so you you when you see a project like that or an effort or a need that you know is going to be controversial you will lay out a path forward for the council to consider for the citizens to offer input on and you start with developing what that plan of moving through this difficult problem will be um and uh the frequency and the specifics of uh when we will get together and and and have presentations and have input and have discussions and one will come back without with the responses to uh things that maybe are more challenging to to work through uh and you work through the process from from start to finish but for us for something that's challenging that can easily take a number of meetings it can take a number of months in fact but that's the way it's supposed to be done uh because these issues are are not easy um most of the decisions that you know difficult decisions that i've gotten to deal with over the years there are six good reasons to do it one way and there are five and a half good reasons to do it the other way and so they that's the nature of many of things that we deal with and so our job is to work through the best that we can with tremendous input and cooperation from the council and the citizens to uh to forge that best plan that meets the greatest okay need you how would you consider reaching out to the residents of bel air beach and then following them in the city process well i would i would think the uh the most appropriate way would be as i mentioned that we'll have a number of initiatives including the the budget um we'll have a number of challenges and problems that we need to work through and so i would build into my presentations to you how we would handle public information public input and so because i think it's it's easier for for citizens to talk about particular problems particular concerns something that's concrete to deal with that's that's a that's a very productive way to do it now i have also in communities where i have worked i have also visited each of the neighborhood associations on a regular basis on their time on their schedule in the evenings on the weekends to to get input to get ideas uh to get concerns of things that we need to be thinking about to focus out um and that's been really helpful and i've been very honest and open in terms of you know what i know at the time and what i know might be possible and take their comments and concerns and requests to heart and bring them back to you um in a number of forums that we uh would move through and address and solve and put better systems in place thank you all right this will be the last question we're going to run a couple of minutes over because we started a couple of minutes late so lloyd roberts hey ken lloyd again so as you have a lot of experience in the public works arena um could you share with us um kind of drilling down a little bit what challenges you've had experiences you've had with regards to roads and storm water systems in our small town that we have here that's that's probably one of the couple of the bigger projects that we are challenged with so both roads and stormwater systems your experience in those areas um good good question well in my years i have been in charge of six public works operations many of them in florida and of course when you're in florida and many other places you're dealing with storm water it's absolutely essential and storm water it's on the march here in florida we're very progressive in florida the state's very progressive in terms of what they require from us as municipality in terms of storm water um it's truly important in terms of addressing the the concerns that that happened with with storm water events i have a lot of experience doing that very very experienced at developing stormwater master plans and securing the funding it takes to implement the capital projects and other projects to that it takes to implement those stormwater master plans and improve the flooding situation and protect our residents and their property and there is more grant money out now in florida and at the federal level than there ever has been so there's great opportunity especially in storm water um i'm very strong in you know in in roads and bridges in fact i early in my career i didn't put it down after serving as a county highway superintendent in charge of all the roads for a county east of albany new york i i went to cornell university and i ran their local roads program and i trained public works directors and city engineers county engineers in how to design build maintain uh roads and streets um so i know that material backwards and forwards thank you ken all right mr griffin we appreciate your interest in city manager position uh and it was very nice uh to meet you tonight i'm sorry we couldn't see you on video but uh that's okay um we're out i'll send i'll send patty a picture so uh we're out of time and uh we're going to terminate this call now and uh someone will contact you tomorrow and let you know what our decision was all right thank you i very much enjoyed talking with each of you thank you so much for all your time tonight have a good night thank you we got a mirror and a tech expert yeah that's all can you go back should be in the job description absolutely all right well let's uh let's talk about mr griffin for about 10 minutes and then we'll take a short break and we'll come back and we'll begin discussion of all all the candidates remember we're only discussing yeah i'm glad i asked that last question because and this is not to throw down on anybody but um the previous city manager when i would ask questions about like the master stormwater event so why are we doing it this way well because the engineer gave it to us this guy would be asking lots of questions when we get things like that to come in from his experience and knowledge base that could be invaluable i agree uh leslie um i i don't know his experience seemed much more engineering-wise than city manager was if that makes sense it does make sense any other comments no do you know what's cited up for your background about the point when's working with these guys in the military he has two schools here uh graduate of the kennedy school of government executive program over at harvard and then the cornell executive program those are where we send our top people we you know send these you know future call or generals through those schools so that's a that's a pretty good highlight but what stuck down with me was in all my time in city you know sitting here as a council member we've always had to push prom ask questions it's like forget everything why didn't you ask that i mean you nailed it you know this is the person that will ask the questions but more importantly he says he build a process he award him work the process and he would brief the council we've always said said you should be bringing us the solutions we're not here to do your work i mean glenn's coming in daily is like no no no no no no we're going to work this strategic plan did you look at this this this is the type of person that will bring us a solution you know we have limited hours here we work with their jobs as well so bring us the solution don't bring us a problem and this sounds like the person that would bring in the solution i like that it sounded like what he would do is a lot different than what we've been doing in other words i've done all the research here are your options right now there's accounts i'll brief council please direct me which way would you like me to go they're both awesome awesome paths but uh that's kind of what i envisioned with with mr griffin vice mayor if you if you look at his background very heavy engineering licensed professional engineer that sort of thing if you look at his experience he's worked in managers jobs and counties and that sort of thing but what you probably don't appreciate is that in his engineering work he's working in teams and you know that's a a very collaborative process very technically oriented and you need to bring people on board with ideas and you know it's fact-based kind of stuff at the end of the day to make the best decision you can based on that sort of thing with that said you know with this heavy background in engineering which what you what you cannot exclude is that this guy's got a phd in leadership management okay it from my engineering background is you don't have the geeks managing the geeks okay and this guy obviously took it to the next level and understands you know what what's important in getting people to work in teams and what motivates with respect to our infrastructure problems this guy could be the man of the hour right i agree and even if even if he didn't come on board long term because as as randy touched on down there you know the average term of a city manager this guy brings a lot of experience and a lot of know-how that we could capitalize on in the next couple of years and not only that but i'm assuming with all this engineering work and public utilities in the saint peter he's bringing his role at dance with him he has a network and he has the context that could the contacts that can really move some of our projects i i agree with you 100 i think if if this council wants to fast track our infrastructure capital improvements this is the way that that's probably a good route to go as far as uh personality wise and how he would interact with the residents i don't know i think uh i would have to uh definitely see him in a second interview and and get a feel for that but for the most part he seemed personable and i was easy to talk to seemed to have the right answers and uh i i wouldn't mind bringing it back for a second i wish we could have seen it so he was at a disadvantage that we couldn't see sometimes that's better yeah um if i could follow the vice mayor uh there's something really struck me professorships with five major colleges university since 1988 okay he's taught brad's courses this is his words he's not a hard engineer in leadership and management international studies public administration and there's the checkpoint advanced stats but he co-developed a new master's degree program in engineering management for the university of mississippi now if i know yeah working the engineering i mean i got my ms in software engineering you have the heart engineers engineering management's for the mba student this is the type of person that puts things together looks at funding they do engineering by budgets contracts instead of slide rules and hard calc so my my question goes back to would he come here to go and oh we i have nothing to i have nothing to do that's that's my fear is that it's uh our problems seem large to us uh to this guy this this is a walk-in party it seems like but i also worry about someone we never thought for it a million-dollar contract yeah billions no problem all right any other comments before we take a short break now let's take uh i'd say we take 10 minutes with a crowd let me go over the crap all right all right everybody ready stand up and remember uh we're talking about the i was leading them in a scratch almost like one of those japanese auto manufacturers good yeah all right hey uh the meeting is back in progress and uh let's just say 10 tilly okay all right um we're back and uh before we begin discussions i need a motion uh to select two of the four candidates for in-person interviews i'm just going to need a motion to actually move forward with this so that we can like make a motion including immediately but this is going to open up discussions i'd like to make a motion to move forward on voting on two to progress to the next level of interviews questions [Music] i feel that we have reviewed first of all we've taken into consideration the scoring and the work from our citizens we've listened to their concerns we've listened to their inputs with all the candidates we have then thoroughly investigated ourselves by reviewing their packages that we asked them to submit and their resumes and finally we have talked to them via skype or the phone to get a better feeling for them asking them individual questions thank you very much [Applause] you're probably going to ask for citizens but we're fortunate we've got two of our citizens advisor committee members here and they gave us the initial list and they listened to the candidates like we did so i hope we can move after we do this one round and we're going to the citizens thank you okay well in that case let's take it to this who would like to speak yes sir please come up to the podium give us your name and address and uh let's hear what you have to say if you all can hear me okay i don't think the citizens can hear yeah we need you too i'm sorry are there citizens listening and i did have the honor of serving on the citizens advisory committee i think that what we witnessed tonight was proof that we had whittled it down sufficiently to give you some choices that appear to be meeting all of the requirements first of all and secondly that you feel comfortable talking to them and that they are able to communicate fairly with you one of the things that bothers me a little bit about this is the setting of expectations may be and this is always a problem when you're hiring people that you are not very familiar with we are setting expectations for them to come into a position where we are expecting a huge return on our investment what we've heard tonight know that in the past we haven't gotten everything that we've wanted out of the position before for one reason or another and we have a lot of initiatives that we would like to see happen we finally have city council that can work together along with the mayor and one that can agree on what we need to do and how we should go about getting that done i don't want to risk the initiatives that you all have and the feeling that you all have that we can get this done we can accomplish what we manage for the city by setting expectations for ourselves and also for the new city manager that we may not be able to paint because of the financial constraints we operate the city under i think the biggest issue we have here is that previously although we did get some occasional grant money we have not taken advantage of everything that's out there to the fullest extent for one reason or another neither we didn't have the expertise we didn't have the impetus to do it or we just didn't have the skill set to do it so i think if we don't make sure that whatever we bring into this role can get the money from grants we're setting them up not to be successful in both resident sides and the city council class so i urge you to make sure the next round of questioning that you get comfortable with their ability to raise funds for grants so i hope they spend a little more time trying to figure out from what they say whether they feel they can do this and are willing to set the tone for getting this done and allowing themselves to be successful i wouldn't mind hearing you tell them that the way to be successful in the city manager role is to make sure that you get enough grant money to make the city successful in getting everything the residents need to meet the needs that we're going to have over the next five years so uh thank you all for doing this job it's it's immense and it's hard um you set the time for us and we were able to validate the credentials in the historical background of most of these people but until you actually talk to them one-on-one and i've noticed that you all respond very very well when you get the positive feedback you're looking for it's human nature they all do that and those are the type of people that will be able to meet your needs as well as the needs of the city because they can respond appropriately now can they do the job it's the other half that's all i have to say thank you very much mr goldman okay i appreciate your input anyone else no okay we're back to the council any comments anyone okay fine go ahead i'll address the grant issue what the grants okay okay the corporate memory for the council came back three councils this was it grants was an issue brought by [Music] the original when joey came in i came in warren and nick that was one of our top priorities is the city needs to engage positively and proactively on grants seek grants don't let them just fall into our land but proactively go out there and beat the bushes we said we want somebody designated as a grant manager we need a grand policy okay so at the end of three councils later what do we have we have a part and replica for four hundred thousand dollars and we were going to be obligated two hundred thousand dollars so that was the universe based on the experience level we had in house parks and records and we know how to get back well it obligated us for 25 years and gave us things that we didn't think we needed and you couldn't get rid of if you wanted to in those 25 years and we didn't know what the recurring costs were to support those things so we heard from one guy never stop asking for the money and it sounds to me some of these people have expertise in seeking out grants if you look at mr griffin's experience part of the mindset in good engineering work these days is they will tell you where to go to get the money and you can write into the rfp and the specifications for the rfp of you will help us write the grant work or the great application for that stuff so it sounds to me like he has some experience there now if you're looking for a generalist i think daniels is our guy he had all the the right things you're looking for a laser-focused new infrastructure guy in virginia so i mean these are just things to think about that as far as expectations go i i think we set the expectations but we can again we can manage that kind of stuff part of that's going to be the salary and that's part of the discussion we need to have here is these guys are looking for more money right now than what our salary range is are we willing to make the commitment to bring in-house the expertise we think we need at the time are we going to get a return on that [Music] okay and talking about salaries i did call the mayor of madeira and i asked him okay what what was daniel's making and he said he was making 135 and he received a 500 a month car allowance and i said do you think that that was fair and uh and he said i actually thought it was too much um and then i said well where do you think that bellar beach stands uh whenever we're much simpler we don't have the infrastructure we don't have the commerce where we obviously we have difficult problems we have to manage but they're not it's not to the level of complexity that most municipalities have and uh and he didn't give me a a straightforward answer but he told me he believed that biller beach should be able to hire within the budget that we've allotted so for somebody for either one of these guys i think that if they've even looked at our budget and i think they both said that they did yeah they know they know what we're what we're getting ready to do and um you know we may have to we may have to allow for some wiggle room to make something happen but um i was i was impressed with both and uh i think that uh my decision was made so any other comments how does that quit and i apologize i didn't bring the application uh that they had submitted uh did mr griffin list what his current salary is uh no he did no no he did not no and we know mr daniels is not working right now that's correct one thing i i would like to clarify is are we comparing apples that happens in order to work because we're talking about this you said 135 down in madeira major yes so here's the budget information on our outgoing city manager okay the adopted budget salaries and wages for city manager was a hundred and one thousand dollars right but by the time you add in all the allowances medical care insurance workers come that number was at 138 000 the proposed budget for next year is up to 142 000 so that's all i want to do is clarify when he says 135 thousand is that bottom line i think that was his salary it did not include that workman's that's that's an top that we have exactly right right any other comments should we take it to a vote sure yes all right patty would you mind passing out facilities and as you receive these ballots there is a place for your name and signature please filled out about that field thank you [Applause] thank you so so i think we're fortunate okay this is in no particular order okay vice mayor gunn mr griffin and mr daniels mayor gaddis mr griffin and mr daniels council member roberts mr griffin and mr daniels council member notaro mr cavalli and mr daniels councilmember banker mr reiffler i'm sorry riefler and that was all on his ballot and council member zabel mr griffin and mr daniels okay so you have the one that he did right now it was read another record it was mr cavalli i mean uh mr riefler was his only one okay so the the tally is driven for a valley one reefer one in daniel's five so the top two are daniels and griffin um eddie tomorrow would you please notify all four candidates or the selections mate and uh i'll contact you tomorrow and we'll see about scheduling for the interviews of the top two candidates initially before we end this and get out of here is there any particular day next week that's good for everyone and then i'll have paddy survey banker and shirley and we'll see if the stars can align this will be i mean we can do five or six thursday would be good for me the 28th or monday the 25th um any days yesterday i said something um next week we're talking and don't forget next week it's a big c right big c is it will be in the morning though okay so we won't we'll this will be all right all right um i'm over 89. okay okay you're open i prefer thursdays council members uh with banker and shirley and see if they're okay with thursday and if that works and then uh notify the candidates that thursday is 6pm uh 6 pm will be 5 and we'll interview them and then we'll hire a few things i wish to raise uh one my entire firm will be in bonita springs on thursday for the florida municipal attorneys association it's the annual continuing education conference on what we do um based on how tonight when i don't know that the city attorney presence is critical if need be i maybe could drive back i just want to check if you know if it's the will of the council that the city attorney's office be present for that meeting or not well um you want to zoom in i could zoom in okay that would work i could zoom in i could certainly we can figure out how it works would all feel comfortable doing uh having those interviews and voting without you understood i will figure out a way to make myself available during that time um the second thing i wish to note that other councils have considered i don't know if you folks have specifically addressed this one of your candidates is from out of region you're setting up in-person interviews with hopes that they're here is it the desire of this body if they ask as far as subsidizing that cost at all um i i know in some communities it's sort of been a given in other communities it's been a point of contention and rather than put your staff in the position of hemming and hawing on this short timeline i think it'd be best that this council decided how if it all wishes to address that issue are you recommending paying mileage i'm not making a recommendation either way some places have said we'll subsidize a plane ticket up to x or mileage up to or mileage if you drive others have you know said whether or not they would contribute to the cost of accommodations it's really at your discretion but i did want to sensitize you to that issue in case the question is presented i don't i don't recall particularly where the gentleman is i think it was the carolinas oh jim oh they're both they're both here okay they're both close enough okay i i misunderstood i thought the gentleman in tampa might have been out of state so it's sort of less relevant in that regard i think that's a reasonable ask i thought somebody was coming from out of state my mistake was like four hours four to five hours great dad joke but roughly 45 years mileage plus hotel no just thinking out loud with that it's we're talking we're starting this meeting at i guess six we finished at eight recommended that means for safety you see about mile lodging and a hotel in that case so he's now driving back at eight o'clock getting home at midnight have you prized hotels lately in this area yeah yeah oh you need to stay at the memphis house yeah we'll we'll look into that um well okay so um what i would do patty whenever you contact them um by the way it was did we pick six or five six yeah and then if you receive some pushback just give me a call we'll talk about it okay okay um any other concerns no none from me thank you okay correct issues like that is that something we will discuss after the next interview i mean is that a concern having a guy who's a geo bachelor problem is that how he managed the madeira that did what daniel's is the guy who talked about elizabeth jupiter right yes so when he was a city manager was he had geo bachelor obviously he wasn't going back and forth i believe he he has a permanent residence in jupiter but he was renting a home in madeira and i think his goal is to come i think he even said it in the interview his goal was to come back to the west coast here so is that a requirement i know it's not good i mean eliminated places here in belgrade beach in the salary discussion there will be further um yeah i believe that's that's what we'll have to do uh we those things can also be pending the party's respective positions those things can also be negotiated as part of the ultimate contract entered into i've seen communities say you know no further than a x mile radius something reasonable that captures basically the entire county in a little bit of the periphery so that you know in the event of emergency response again that's negotiated if that if the person's not willing to negotiate that term that's something else but currently the interim city manager gets a car allowance okay other than that um i think you're just some have made some have placed that but living or or alternatively you know will subsidize up to this radius that's probably um once we go through the interview and vote process we'll have to have another meeting we'll call them in and we'll work through the negotiations i don't have anything else i think we uh i think we did a great job and i appreciate everyone's time and i know it was very trying and i appreciate all the work of the citizens advisory committee and uh and i appreciate everyone who came tonight to uh to watch all this take place um would anyone like to make a motion i'd like to make a comment okay sure similar to life we were making the decision for the attorney the city attorney i thought both of those options were terrific i think the four that we interviewed tonight also very good i'm just going to say i know kyle's going to be disappointed but i really feel like in the long run this is going to be best for him i think he's going to get an opportunity to work with and for a professional city manager he's going to learn from that and that's going to be good for him i hope that's the way he looks at it i agree and i believe we received some correspondence about that today he has potential we don't want to lose him but i would also say he's not over till that's right yeah that's right okay so now would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn thank you very much for everything [Applause] i'm gonna make a sunset oh"
