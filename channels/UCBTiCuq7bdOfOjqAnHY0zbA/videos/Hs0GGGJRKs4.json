for joining and then I heard that Kyle had was was at a yeah he's at a flood plane conference this week all right awesome okay Madam chair all right all right first order of business number one is the approval of the agenda today if you look over it quickly and see if there's any adjustments that need to be made I guess and then soon as I can have a motion it' be I'll make a motion second okay approved all right second item is of the meetings but we've up the minutes from the last meeting and we have partly discussed that that they will be coming to us sometime next week yes ma'am okay all right thank so um with that being said would we be able to have Renee distribute them and could we vote via online to approve them just back to Rene personally to approve them so at least we've approved one or we can next okay we can so we can turn bring Rene and ask her that question just so we get clear clarification on it want do that just to make sure by the rules perfect yeah of course we always play by the rules asz I think before we have done two months at once on meeting on minutes so hi reene um can we wait till next month and approve two months of meetings or should can you send us the minutes prior to the next meeting of last month yeah I can send them to you out but you would have to approve them at the next meeting that's not online or anything back to you approve them okay all right thank you I'll and like I said I I'll do both this meeting and the last one I'll have to you next week all right thank you so much all right and agenda item number three is czen comments and we have a lovely guest today Miss Kathleen yep I'm here to make a proposal that we start a community garden on our property and I this is what I'm going to go through for everybody and then you get a special this at the end thank you very much I appreciate it start a community garden yes and where is Victory okay what I wanted okay what kicked all this off is um last year we had a plethora of mangoes I mean we had so many mangoes we couldn't eat them we couldn't freeze them we couldn't turn them into anything and a lot of them went to waste so one of the proposals and I should have retyped this but I didn't the second one is consider opening city hall parking lot for US citizens like maybe an hour during the month where we can trade food so when we have all these overages we can give it to fellow citizens or people can trade or give away other Foods at yeah so like a trade and share fruit and vegetables for us for so you are a resident B 21st Street I love 21st stre perfect yeah great yeah so I think and I you know I I wrote In Here consider opening our city hall parking lot for May to October you choose the months it's up to you guys months to be decided on a weekend day so that we can hit the people that are still working to our residents so they can share their homegrown produce see day time duration to be determined so that would be something and then my example of the reason for that is the mangoes they're just going to waste and a lot of fruit in this city does go to waste it stays on the tree and falls off and we've got people that go north and leave their trees and I I think they should be approached and asked you know do you and and everybody on every street knows who's there full-time and who's not who's got fruit trees and who doesn't so maybe write something to the community about thinking about sharing their wealth their food wealth all right so that was the second part but as far as the Food Forest they used to call them Victory Gardens they're now calling them Community Gardens I call them a food forest and I want to use permaculture standards permaculture standards are low maintenance you're using the Sun the water that's provided through rain you're using as many normal natural things as you can you're not Landscaping you're not doing any of that you're using gilds beneath the trees all of that to feed whatever you're growing so and then of course no chemicals the the amount of um glyphosate that I see being sprayed around here is just unbelievable so that provides a a place to grow food it also provides a place for people to meet and work together in positive relationships and then I had talked to Kyle I did talk to councilman Banker about this and and they both Kyle said to come to this this group and I think that's that's where it belongs so I'm coming here I am a member of a life Farms I don't know if you know that Clearwater has a farm and if you don't know about it you should go out there and visit them cuz they're amazing what where is it they're down starky you go under 19 and you'll see I wish I think it's West Drive or West Street you take a right and it's right there on the left it's across from um oh what is the burial it's across from that burial plot and just before it calvary no no Calgary no I can't remember but it's called member life Farm it's called life Farms life F yeah so check that out and they're also I'm also a member of the um Billard Beach Island Garden Club and they're speak to us at our next meeting which will be in October and they come out they will deliver the reason I bring them to mind is that they will teach they will also deliver Mulch and compost so if we need that we'd have to purchase it and they would deliver it and they do spread it too when they deliver it if you say you know can you put it here they'll do that and it's really high quality better than you can probably buy at Home Depot or Lowe's and then um I suffer from migraines and I there are days like maybe three in a row or more where I can't go outside and I I was never getting my food forest in my yard gone it was always little bitty pieces nothing connected so I hired Food Forest abundance group they're south of Orlando and they came out they gave me a design first they gave me a designer in um France and he gave me a design my food Forest has to be wheelchair accessible so I mean that was a bottom line it gave me a design that wasn't wheelchair accessible so I called the guys in Orlando and I said this isn't cutting it for me I want another designer this designer worked with my yard and I'm really happy with him I had it done about seven months ago they came out 6 months to make sure all the plants were growing and when they were here I walked my designer around this property because I wanted them to see what it looked like in case you decide that you want to go that way you can either hire them to give you a design or to actually give you a design and then execute it come and put all the plants in Plants are expensive but for me it was worth it so I had it designed and then instituted by them so are you self-sufficient are you growing all of your own food or um also my little yard is on the back of this what I did and where I planted it I have one of those Rock yards which really restricts me so anyway I will be this is um today this is what's growing in my yard these are mulberries I don't know if you've ever had a mberry there is no plant in my yard that I haven't thought about mulberries help with um your A1C numbers they help high blood pressure they're not high in sugar and it's a tree that fruits three to four times a year that's another thing I wanted I wanted as many as much of a harvest as I could have in a year these are Everglades Tomatoes they grow on the ground they're um tomato indigenous so and I wanted as much indigenous stuff as I could get now these are for you guys to try I see there's a little somebody in there so be careful to eat a mberry you just hold the stem and then you eat this so you can try one poisonous right poisonous berries trying to poison the committee I don't I don't use any pesticides I'm kiding kiding yeah I'm an anti- EMF anti-chemical person so anyway you're welcome to try these this is for the mulberries and I just picked them so a purple so you get an action to go with your M may I ask a few questions of course please oh do you want to start well just want do you want to finish and then we can ask you questions or that's yeah I don't care yeah that's I don't care I I like City Hall I go to City Hall I want clean water clean food clean air they listen to my rant and I sit down and nothing gets done so the interaction here just now is awesome for me however you guys want to do it I inie so doesn't fit in with your uh way of life kind and I am kind of a propose what are these little tomato things those are called ever cream you said it's on the box see you want to they're organic dead G it Everglades Tomatoes everad Everglades Tomatoes Everglades yep wild that's the breed that's as big as they get I go out every day and I pick some mulberries I go out every day for the mulberries because otherwise the birds get them they very much I don't kill except rats but by the way there are plants that rats don't like like catnip and I have that in my yard and I don't have as many rats as everybody else so you know maybe it's working maybe not there also plants rats don't like and other birds and whatever so that can be in your plan you just tell them I have this kind of problem and I want you to address it one of the things I asked them for and this is disgusting I asked them for a toilet paper plant because we ran out of toilet paper a while back back and um and so they gave me an example well it's it's not acceptable the plant is too small so I'm going to get something else to grow but I mean you got to think about what you might need and then ask for it and the unknowns to me were the land available I know we do um weddings and have functions the water source is available because I don't go out some days I wanted an alternative water system and I have this in my yard right now these are called OAS o l l a you fill them with water you put a little top on them and here they're supposed to last seven days they only last probably four or five days if there's a lot of wind somehow that the plants take the water they water about six feet around so I have a bunch of voyage in my yard you'll see that and then I have um I've tried other ways to water you're welcome to borrow these books I'm going to show you but I want them back so let's see I'm sorry Kathleen you said um your desire clean water clean air and what clean food if you're not checking your food right now with a magnet at Publix you're making a big mistake I've already found beef and chicken with something um metallic in it with and I carry a magot with me with what just a magnet a little magnet I have it in my purse and what happens with the magnet it sticks to the meat because there's metal in the meat that you're ruing a lot of things from me oh W there metal in my more than you want to know maybe but I've been chemically poisoned so really maybe I don't want to know boy I sure do like those chickens I got it publ and the and the coffee we're going to start on the coffee again this is just you just run this little magnet across the top if it sticks you don't buy it I had one lady had a beautiful state the kind men would like to grill outside and drink a beer with and she asked me to run my magnet across it and it's stuck really strong and she goes now what do I do I said you make a choice are you going to eat that you know I don't know anyway so that's that's okay let's see okay so water sources you have more than just the water from City Hall available we can do this many ways and then plants and trees available we need some rules like I know we don't have homeless I don't ever see homeless people over here eron I don't know if we have them or not but we do we we have some that will come and um here underneath the bridge not a lot not a lot and we our sheriffs or deputies they do a really good job of see I don't think and we always have a sheriff's car back there so I think we'll be okay but there need to be rules in interest like are you going to let all the residents you know gain from what you've done or just the people that work it and there there are little things that need to be done it's not totally so you could always charge a membership fee correct that's it see that's why you're there and I'm here and then interest our people going to be really interested in this okay can I CL I got okay and then advantages like the improved air soil and health I chose a um mango tree because it's supposed to be one of the highest trees to take carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen so I have a big mango tree in my yard you know so that there's a lot of truth to this that I think maybe is yet to be proven or discussed or whatever but it does improve the air in your health and then increased access to food and then the physical security and the I don't know the interaction between people I think all of that would be good for us and then we always have University of Florida extension they're phenomenal yes when we moved over here to the beach we contacted them about certain trees and things like that they they sent a booklet I mean a stack of paper like this about this thick about two different trees we were asking questions how to when they did the sand here I took the old sand and the new sand there and had them analyze it and then sent it to me because anyway because and how was it it's different it's made out of different things said that first of all it killed all of the my son fishes this area it killed all of what we call Sand Fleas I don't know what they're really called so that's what he was using to fish the beach so that's gone so we're waiting maybe for that to come back it's lighter so the next storm it'll all be gone one now I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure that was the way to go that came from those things probably probably bugs okay and then let's see the Port available there um there are many Community Gardens in Tampa that you guys could could see and walk through and then there's this Coalition that you can get in touch with there's University of Florida the Food Forest abundance people and then the Beller Beach Garden Club those ladies were scared when I first briefed them but I said they're not going to you know you're not going to be the ones doing it you're going to be the ones maybe helping or advice maybe yeah they like that's how I wanted to use the Garden Club yeah so anyway I think they would be a good resource and then as far as understanding um permaculture this is a great book for permaculture if you're unfamiliar with it and in my yard if you go by my house and I'll invite you all to come and have a tour but I don't do that for everybody so so where are you on 21st um 106 okay on 20th so oh yeah you're right next door yeah I walk up and down your street yeah you'll see my little peanut but anyway by the kitchen window I have a what they call a herb spiral it's a way of getting 26 feet of planning space in 6 ft is what I did I only had so much space and you'll see it's full and then I've got Parsley Sage time B is that what you're talking about something s can't do that here why not why don't we we could have a much bigger we a much bigger I mean that's up to you my son built it for me but this is a good book talks about that and it gives you different ideas talks about what wi does how to make your own mulch I this is a really good basic book for permaculture and then um you know you don't have to stick with what people say you should grow and eat you can also look at what you can't eat that's out there like our weeds eat the weeds there's a guy out there who does tours I've taken it he he he'll go to a park and just walk through the park and tell you what you can eat and what it'll do for you there's so much out there so I wouldn't plant weeds but I would eat them and then the second page is my yard and the spiral in the front is the herb spiral and then there's the Mulberry Tree you'll see and then a Moringa in the middle and the moringa is supposed to be the tree that's going to save the world you can eat the leaves you can eat the bark you can eat the um Roots I only eat the leaves it has fruit that's super long I've never seen any fruit like that all the Islanders know how to cook it and how to make it and it's it's good and it has a lot of medicinal properties so that's why I have a Moringa now the MinGa and the Mulberry you cut down every year really severely and then it'll come just back beautiful and you can use both of those they call it Cho and drop you can use it kind of as Mt she chop you know the branches off and then cut them up and then put them around well can I just interrupt you have an amazing wealth of knowledge and fabulous ideas but I think we get the Gest so okay let's am I right like I think we get the Gest about what you're trying to accomplish which is pretty much Community utilization sharing your fruits and vegetables planting as a community just the betterment of the city so with that being said I don't think we should get too far into the horiculture part of it because you could really like be speaking Greek to me you know I'm not that person who understands it and I don't I want to like give you my input if I can okay um number one thing I know offand is the city's booked almost every single weekend and they make a lot of money from booking weddings events or whatever so the parking lot must be reserved on the weekends for whatever events however if you as a citizen want to book out a certain amount of rentals and pay for the price of renting it for a farmer's market so in in other words let's say you have a small membership of 10 people in it then everybody will contribute just let's say to the reserving the parking lot fee I don't know let's say it's let's say it's $100 let's I don't know what it is what is it I don't know yeah because it's you have to reserve the venue and they're not going to let you reserve the parking lot if the venue is having people load and unload so I can see them saying yes to maybe doing it on like third third week like Thursday third afternoon or something every like third Thursday something catchy you know but to say on the weekends maybe they could do it at that 4 or 5:00 6:00 time you know what I'm saying and but maybe you could have something like that where somehow you have to have somehow the city has to be paid for their space yeah that's I think that's number one and to consider how often it is used on the weekends and then number two we do do a lot of community things and I'm just going to lay it out there we do not get a lot of community involvement I know and it's very heartbreaking we clean the bridge we clean the beach we have events we put on conferences demonstration Wellness things very very partially attended so I also work on the belir beach Community Foundation so I have a rare situation of being with this board and that board so I think I see things from the nonprofit side and I see things from the city side with that being said that's why I said interest yeah I mean it's it's definitely an interesting concept but a can the city just grant you land is that like I don't like I don't know I think that's something you're going to even have to I guess probably not discuss something about randy it it would definitely have to be something with city council but maybe maybe what we could do is discuss it as a group maybe brainstorm a little bit and get back to you with maybe things we see as a possible way to move forward how much are you willing to take on um if if we do do a garden let's say there is a belir beach residen fee I don't know say $10 $15 $ something to make those people accountable yep so you have to also maintain it for this fee and then you get to participate you want to share your vegetables you share yeah I don't know something like that but from a financial point there is a lot to discuss um from a liability point because we'll have then unsupervised children or kids or people on the property that's where this Coalition of Community Gardens can come in so what like get some type of umbrella in Insurance under them because talk to them and ask them are these issues have you approached these issues have you solved these issues do you have these issues right you know I don't know I've never been in a community garden I've never worked in a community garden I like the concept I like the idea yeah I too it's great for students I just hate to see a waste so like like Deb was saying we can discuss it as an idea you're talking about cuz we do think it's a great idea we just have to find the logistics of and to see how we could possibly fit into the scope of what the cting needs to do because also we have we have an option like if you happen I'm just going to put everything out there since I know if you happen to go through b air Beach Community Foundation you could actually adopt an area and make a par you can adopt a park and make a park a garden you have that right as a citizen to pay for that Park adopt it have it be tax deductible and you can help design an area of a park or something but coming directly through the city I bet there's going to be a lot of steps but we could start here too yeah I mean you have to start somewhere exactly and did you when you walk this area with that person yeah did you see an area that you had in mind would be a good spot for it or did they have an to the left of the of the Playard right in there was the best there's one area out front you could plant a tree you know a tree but nothing but yeah just a tree I mean you're not and with the tree you do a guild so there's probably the tree and then a nitrogen fixture and then something else there'll be three things in there if that all keep the soil and the tree going but there wasn't really much and then over there where the water retention is on the other side of the tennis courts I mean that's you couldn't do that cuz it's salt water you also have the option of you know what speaking to the board of um the belir Community Foundation and seeing if this is something maybe you can get them to consider raising funds for next year we already have our project for this year which is the Veterans Memorial project and we are building a what go ahead I I'm anti- EMF I know that 5G is a weapon I've tested this building this is not a good building I my home is not safe I've fought to keep um the smart meters for my home right now I'm I'm fighting to not let them read my water meter with make it digital so I believe at one point Kyle put out a note that Duke Energy was going to do something there put something else in there I haven't tested that with my EMF meter but if you're going to do something for veterans it should be safe and there's very few emfs that are safe I mean the I can bring an EMF meter and show you that some other time but I mean it should be safe you don't want a vet to sit there and be bombarded with emfs they got enough problems is it called EMS electromagnetic frequencies yeah frequencies and I'm sensitive and that's why I'm and that that's fighting all that like Baby Monitors baby are full of it and that's why you know they when you have the cameras on the babies there's some that are much higher in the EMF than others and and I only know that because my daughter had to study all them before put one in her Bas interesting yeah something you know something that gets in our system okay it changes how your medications work I did a briefing for the city in 20120 I think on emfs asking them not to to allow them to put any 5G in here and that was just like talking to a brick wall too yeah that's like the 5G phones that was that's when it was a big deal when all the 5G phone things were com 5G does not work in heavy rainstorms it does not go through trees I mean people I think believe that it's the answer to communication anyway I'm off track story so yeah so um you know if there's anything else you want to say or do you want us to just we would take this under under consideration consider it yeah I mean it sounds like a really great idea it might be something better for the foundation versus parks and wreck or a combination or a combination and that's something also we work hand inand together on a lot of projects so they're helping with this they're helping us with that like for instance John came to Beach uh Bridge cleanup like we all just are working for the betterment of the city um we're trying to have bring the city together in a social way in a really Community like a a Mayberry Community you know that's what we want we're small enough to do that we are small enough and we should have that um I just put out a survey did you resp respond on the survey that went out because we were we asked that's I had negative comments so I didn't respond I would have preferred it was it was about the emfs and I no it was it wasn't about emfs it was about just it was about this and it was about community activities people doing things together what type of things do does the community like to see us do together are you interested in doing things together because I put that out because we are not getting good turnouts for things so if it's a waste of time then we'll put our money into other things beautification projects Farms who knows but we we do need to know do the citizens not really want to participate is it are we getting financing and donations from the same 10 people all the time it's not worth it then is it the same 10 people doing all the work so I love your idea I I don't know how we can move it forward maybe we could involve students you know there's a lot of potential to it Community hours I don't know but I think you came to the right place yeah for the start definitely yeah well thanks it is government so we don't move too quickly so you know we meet once a month I like I'm being honest you know we meet once a month we are are not permitted to communicate to each other oh I know in between in between unless we go through Renee and that's what all that discussion was before so just so you know we'll probably do a little brief rebrief or whatever once you leave and then Michael will put it in his notes it will be in the meeting notes and then really we won't be able to discuss it again until next month no I know okay yeah all right no I I ran it one time for an office thank you for timing up I did have a quick question I'm sorry so on the um what's kind of the what would sort of black a better term the the mobilization and the time to you know if something were you know as a project it depends it depends you know are we going to plant the plants are we going to somebody has to come up with a plan and then everybody has to prove it and then we do it okay so you can ask do it as we could do it correct we don't have to go out anywhere we probably have enough trees that we can get seeds from or whatever that we could even do that I mean like I have I don't know if I want to plant a tree but I can plant an herb garden and I'm pretty sure you don't want physically I wouldn't want to and you're right if we do an herb garden that maybe that's where we start big herb garden and have somebody build yeah the spiral and it's really hard to do aard and and another way to do an herb garden that doesn't take up much space is and you're Recycling and reusing is pallets just the wooden pallets I have that's what I have and have those long narrow planter boxes in it and you can grow herbs in there and it's kind of just leans against the wall yeah so well you it's another just again just easy and let not a doesn't take up a lot of space but I I'll love the idea of the community garden and sharing like you said the mangoes cuz I have a neighbor that has a plora of them and his next door neighbor is not happy with it cuz it brings all them fruit rats but so we other neighbors go and pick because the neighbor that owns the tree lives in Chicago except for out of the year which is maybe behind you I think it is I think I think it is exactly behind me because he's yeah cuz you're on the even side of the street and I'm you're behind George yeah oh okay so it's next neor to George going west yeah I know I know what it is okay that tree is huge and then across the tree there's another one with mangoes and those it's funny those just disappear it's like who took them you know we don't none of us know mhm but yeah but yeah just even if we just started like with the herb garden and then maybe that food share just a food share you know like and you come up here and I don't think two to three cars would interfere with a um if it's two to three cars community so on Saturdays is when we the typical time that we have you on weekends it's bumped you know this and the parking is open for those that have b the the facility but maybe on Sundays something it doesn't matter I'm talking one hour we me I'm not talking a lot of time not not a 6 hour not a eight to 12 no and you can even do like you could notify the city you know okay we do we have a plethora of whatever and if you get answers back say okay we'll open you know you can meet at City Hall if you want manges or tomatoes some people have tons of tomatoes oh man I would be showing up for tomatoes cuz I can't grow those to save my we have a lot of rats question have you had any um Community interest have you discussed this with others I'm a severe introvert it's very hard for me to talk to people so I mean I do it and I was a commander four times I've done it a lot I can do it this will make me tired when I go home I'm sorry no yeah commission officer in the Air Force no I was an army colonel I had four commands so I've been around no wonder you know all these things I you know what anything about I was going to say I just skip through life like this you know no no no no no skipping well thank you for your service for yeah for sure Heavenly okay but you're right we need to be oh I read that I I I just didn't respond okay I'm sorry it's not meeting or standards we were just trying to honor our veterans here you got a lot of them I know well if you have suggestions we're happy to take them yeah they they are very open to suggestions the on the secetary I will look at it seriously and I will write you listen but like right why don't I give you my email right now I'm being hacked I'm on my sixth day of no email but I will okay well you're welcome to email me my email is on the city website um I'm Debbie okay okay and um I don't know if I don't think I have a card and uh yeah so just email me and whatever you want to discuss about this please feel free check that Park too with my EMF meter okay great cuz I don't know what they did out there and I don't know how to fix that you can Shield against EMF if it's it's not that hard but you can you can look that up that stuff I okay this this is listen to her suggestions she makes let's see this is e this fights EMF this fights EMF I have I mean I'm sensitive I I start not feeling well I have something in my purse did you ever see the show better call saw no okay why CF this is a so you have like all these absorbers or blockers I would say they're putting out their own signals that keeps those away so more like a blocker yeah yeah more of a blocker but you can block EMF like when I was doing the smart meter test and I I had Duke come out and they showed me all their different Smart Meters you can block an EMF from coming into your house with a window screen that's made out of metal there are paints you can use I'm going to have my house painted with one of those paints but I mean it's it changes the way your medications work and people need to know that Kyle should have my briefing that I did for the city on 5G because I'm sure he I'm sure he would I don't have access Lords of London won't ensure against any emfs that tells you something you know it is very harmful to human beings well thank you very much than you than really appreciate your time very much good to see you again oh yeah it's always good to see you and and let me know about your thoughts about this cuz we really did expect or hoped to make our veterans happy not upset so no no I'm not I'm not upset at all yeah okay so contact me we would love to even have you join us and for the ribbon cutting ceremony I have I have a son whose heart stopped four times he's 33 when he was 29 I have a grandson who has CP I'm the only driver I get migraines I have a lot going on so to ask me it's not like I'm just retired I wish I was okay all right well we really appreciate taking the time to come here thank you thank you so much for coming thank you see give us some good advice thank you take care all right so mirror list updates yes next agenda mirrorless updates okay I told to John he tried very hard to come today John Comer John Wagner um and um he actually said I tried to come but he teaches at Caddy's he does a sunset class oh cool every Thursday at 4:00 or 4:30 and he said he had 18 people sign up today so we really need to go set up cuz it takes him a while to set up for that many people but he said if we have any questions for him to directly he text him he'll have his phone next to him while he's teaching and he'll try to respond but he is very eager to do it he can start with one wall and he said and I don't have Kyle here to ask the question I was going to ask but um 1,500 and he could kind of stretch that that includes everything that's the paint and everything we don't have to buy the paint separately it's 1,800 for the 15 15 for one wall no one wall but he said he could also maybe stretch that meaning like go around a little bit more on on on the like the one with the doors maybe we could get three walls for that's a good yeah if he did all three walls would he have a a lower price per wall or something well that yeah that's what Debbie was just saying and he said he would definitely work with us he knows it's government you can't nothing moves as she was saying nothing moves quickly in government I told him that the very first time I spoke with him yes can you edit out the part that I talked about my son's heart and my grandson I I didn't capture yeah personal I speak the day about that okay thank you yes ma'am thank you so um so yeah um and and I told him we wanted more of a simplified picture not as is detailed nearly as detailed are we going to do the shelves or we going to do the um well my mine was more like this in my head very simple maybe a palm tree and a turtle had we thought about and this was something I thought about a week or so ago um what is our local high school what would be considered the local high school for usgo lgo maybe clear water clear water we did talk about that a little well I was wondering if we if we offered a not a contest but a submission an art submission to a student there um and they can draw up something and we as a board could choose you guys Bo could choose what yeah but then we're putting it out to Largo instead of okay good good point all right yeah okay just it is a it is a good point though and but John he wants to do his own design yeah he's going to want to do his own design I'm sure um his work is excellent but I was thinking if I can interrupt on the outside wall the one that faces the street even though you guys you know want a mural I feel like it kind of should be like a really beautiful like a belir beach mhm I welcome like just like on the front of it some really beautiful like welcome to belir Beach and then have our little work underneath nothing too much but and then the rest of the building can be like maybe where the concession stand is even though the doorway maybe be a little bit more elaborate and then more something simple on the beach side again yeah I do like the welcome part yeah and and it could be very simple like you're saying just like the welcome part is up here and then the picture well that's the door side in it the bottom line is it will be seen from the street and I think since you know we always feel like we don't have such a Magnificent Presence but we are magnificent it's a good way to say hey welcome you know at least it it will be eye-catching and like you're saying the um more in the belir logo mhm and and he and I were talking and I told him some of these were M yeah much color to I want it more like the blue that you have on there I think is phenomenal and it it just had some clouds added to it and a tree and a turtle or something and again I'm not an artist but he could add to that the welcome to b or just B be again I don't I think if we're going to be simplifying it and I think if we could really put into terms and really come up with something for him and say John look simplii I'm sure I hope he could get the the price down a little bit and you know we can go from there it would be it would be nice to get all something okay yeah cuz I've got I do have that artwork I do that's on you okay are you going to do it if you do it that would be awesome that would be awesome if I get get Italian food I don't know oh I'll get I'll get you some food well my neighbor across the street own two restaurants in Jersey I think Philly Italian and he is Italian oh my goodness yeah single guy at home making stuff in you don't need carbs every now and then I do I got to feed the body so I come up with some renderings and okay yeah and you guys I'm the type that you don't like it to say it you're not Hur feelings well I I took it to were you at the meeting the council meeting I didn't okay I went to the council meeting did my little report thing and asked them told them about it and they said um that they would prefer us to let them approve it first I mean I I blatantly ask would you just like let us make the choice of the picture and no that was not they kind of said we would like to see it before you have the painting so so yeah we have to take it to them first yeah I think so um but with that being said if John can do it and it's 15 let's say it's 15 are we in do we have the funds oh we have kle said we have 2500 right now and budgeted for us to do things now we have to think is that for the rest of the year right right now is the term he used that's why I said I wish I could ask him that today but um we have to think about okay are we going to do Halloween and we going can I have can I make a suggestion first of all if we have $2500 that's our entire budget correct well again right now right now and we would still have Halloween or whatever else we're sponsoring but how about let's say we get a drawing we get a rendering and I don't know maybe 1 hour a Saturday or a couple of hours on a Saturday we stand out there with the drawings of what we're trying to raise the money for and a little bucket and people throw us some money I don't know if that's legal why not we're raising money ping you you talking about at Morgan Park stand right there you you know set up like a table like a little we talked about you know having like that Public Safety yeah yeah I mean that could be something that's part of that too you know I mean that could always be a table there where CH folks oh you talking about a table literally at Morgan Park where we're going to paint right where we're going to paint we could have the easel up showing the artwork and you know take donations I don't know maybe you can't I don't know I do I think you could raise more money uh just getting all the different people are on all different committees in Belair you know in Belair Beach the this commune and the city council and the board of adjustment anything like that and just say we're trying to raise money for this uh would you do it and you'd probably be better off to have to just turn the fundraising over to the uh Foundation yeah but that's that's tricky um or why wait wait wait wait why is that tricky cuz a foundation has lots of rules lots and lots of rules that they have to go by law rules yeah no I I understand so does the city deductibility I understand that stuff well that's what I was going to say I don't even know I think we can raise funds right parck and wreck can raise funds I have no idea I'm not sure about that that's what I said would that be legal I another question those L would answer that along those lines youread joh okay so we're not well I guess we should finish the muralist update first okay go ahead so um anything else about that oh I know about the muralist I've done he did say you know there are s he John comr the muralist did say um you know there's several signs right in front of that front wall I said yes I know I talked to you and Kyle about moving the signs we would move those that would be a problem okay and I told and and I said and we want to make those signs prettier too so with some good Italian food we have no problem doing that what's your favorite just shake down you said you were a great cook 15 minutes ago so that's all whatever you want I'll make it little fat too I make it okay all right so here's the deal let's just I guess decide to move forward and yeah he's going to dra that very simple that front wall again Mr comr is going to want to do the design himself but we can say this is what we want we want very simple and I express that over and over I don't want anything that looks like hurricane hes no I don't either you know and he didn't do the alligator and all that on this end he did the far end the South End um but um and I said and not too more muted that's not the term I use but softer colors softer mhm like Bel Beach is soft and sweet so but just not too too elaborate yeah um yeah Turtle yes tasteful lot of turtles out there on our beaches so that's why I thought a turtle would be good palm tree something simple is anybody have any other ideas that they would like on the wall I do love a mermaid but w but we don't have FAL ad sh Mar well I did see I was at the beach on Saturday no this is wonderful my 9-year-old grandson and I were out in the water and we were the only ones in the water and there was like 15 at least other people when I group up on the beach and we're out there and from me to that wall a man aray he went up in the air and came down and made his big SWAT he had to be at least 5ot across that's it was so awesome I thought I thought um Phoenix and I were just going to I don't know what we were we were just did you see that both that hitting each other did you see whoa and oh I have I had no idea so Co to watch them do that little whatever they do whatever it's called when they come up and flap breaching I don't but it was and then we watched him go all the way down we wanted him to Flap again and he did amazing yeah it was so amazing not scary that CU they don't scare me but i' have been scared no shitless no no no so anyway so we could do a manay or a turtle or I've seen manatees manatees right across I don't want to see a manate on the building they're not pretty they look like yeah SE cowsar just go to the beach know yeah I see them in my yard so vanities and Turtles all right so anything else on the mural is update we kind of got a thing that A's going to draw draw us up we're going to I'll I'll talk to Mr comr again one of the biggest things is getting this done quickly before it's too hotm CU that's going to be direct sun on him you know in the morning it's going to be direct son on that wall so it would need to be done later in the afternoon so did he even give you a start date because he's still working on something that's why he can't he's still up there yeah that's why he can't return calls um no he did not cuz he knows we're dragging our feet too so but I think he said only few more weeks in the place up on the block all right well let's not drag our feet Let's uh would be the the timing for I know you said the council wants to um prove the design first well they meeting they have a meeting May 6 if we could have a rendering at that point I think we could take it to him at that point we could we could ask it to be on the agenda or I could do it just as a that's soon so that's before meeting so um maybe if we I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm just that would mean that you you would be taking something to them to approve that we haven't even looked at doesn't it yeah well can't you he's going he's going to send it to us can send it just like Mr comr sent these to me inil I see okay so you're going to send it to us you PF files then and we can we can talk to Renee or talk to Aaron and say I like it I like it I like it I don't like it it sucks whatever then then of course you're are you not running the risk that uh there won't be adequate consensus before the meeting no why why you I'm just just I'm only asking about the process that's all right okay that's fine and in other words I guess are we are you going to be moving forward with consensus in in other words where we're all going to have to agree on it already for you to say pretty much to council this is what we would like so and it doesn't have to be an exact again it is what we are thinking like the idea right yes yes okay still in a picture form and then we can finalize the details you know cuz I can send it to him I can forward it to him I can start working on that tomorrow okay yeah very easy to do I think that we um maybe maybe there's a there's a motion because you're going to go before the Council on behalf of the board so I think we probably need a motion I think so too to say that kind of just outline what we just in terms of the process and say hey aon's going to provide some designs we're going to you know by proxy we're going to vote on the designs and then we authorize Patty to go before the board on May 6th for their approval of the mural so I I I'll write down what I wrote but that's my motion okay moving so Michael's making the motion and I we'll second it okay motion approved that we will have a design that we vote on three proxy that I can take to the board the council you should call a question okay you should call for vote call I I I okay y okay okay so I I'll word SM it m what great but it's basically you know what I said is that Aaron's going to give us the designs we're going to receive them via email or whatever vote proxy and then Pat's going to present them on me you lost weight I did I know I lost a bunch of weight yeah like 30 lb I see i' let you know yeah I almost died oh no why okay wait a minute after the meeting all right we write down moving on to number five five uh yeah so par updates um I've received par uh John and I communicated um you got some information that you didn't as far as the spreadsheet that we're using oh yeah I talked to kle about that we we can figure it out uh well how we do we have it from like 2020 all the way to 2024 right now so currently with what we've got um going back to what you talked about the beautification that was mentioned earlier about the medians in the Gulf we're actually going to take that on next week I think we're going to start putting some flowers and um so is there water to those or you yeah we do um there is water there is water we have not had the water on because we've had nothing there okay uh we've had drop resistant plants so we didn't have to worry about it um so I I do know that the Public Works guys uh they saw I mean rocks doing it and they took a vents to it um so they actually brought this idea up to us as well they want to outdo what Indian Rocks has done in their medians who was this the uh this was our Public Works uh Justin in public work okay Public Works yes sir yeah his crew yeah my crew so they know what flowers to use they know yeah we're I mean yeah I mean you know I know like Largo lgo they're doing anous which I think we can get through amplex the wholesale cost are so small it's not going to take a lot of money no eort very Che I mean I volunteered to do it myself but that would caus like traffic problems cones so the other so the other again on those reports that we have uh for instance you know one of them was there's a a screw head up on a bench it's the handle um you know so there's certain things that we have tackled uh there's an offence uh was whose report was that was that yours or yours like algae on the fence okay yes yeah I don't know if we can do anything yeah so we can yeah so those are some things that I'm getting that we're trying to make you know uh the right steps to get it rectified even if it's not our property So currently we're with doll reports I've received were at 36% completed okay so a quick question yes sir what is the um again the process so we we do these inspection reports we make observations and you know that's just in the opinion of of that particular person somebody else might I don't have any problem with it whatsoever sure okay so the process we submit these reports nobody here I mean our committee doesn't say yeah we we think this is deal John Wagner goes and does an inspection report and we send the thing in Deb does an inspection report goes in right so there is no this group never reaches any cons consensus any of stuff would you agree no I would agree with you I mean everyone's opinion everyone's opinions are subjective of course um so they're not they're not even the opinions of the committee they're M they're actually the opinions of parks and rec committee members do a report and send it to the city sure right is that the exact it so I mean how this how the process is started well since I've started this position last year you I get your reports you know I I keep on like these are last year's reports um so I got the new ones here I go through I do read every single one of them and I figure out well what's you know what how can the city meet some of these projects um in an efficient manner and and financially fiscal manner uh talk about that financially fiscal or financially responsible okay so it's one thing to say you know this needs to be raped out or uh or uh the grass this area needs to be tended or somebody needs to go over here and paint so say for instance these park benches need to be replaced MH okay now how do you what is the process there I go I will go and so everything that I see like uh someone had mentioned shell was it you again need shell in some of the parks done oh it's been done so I I go look um and see what you guys have observed something that I may have overlooked I'm not perfect of course right um but then if I'm like yeah I totally agree we get it done um I do I have to keep my budget of course what is the budget in other words when we talk about going making observations every time I make an observation even if somebody has go out there and look at it it cost money well right no because they were on staff yeah I mean it's they're employed well I understand but they could be doing something else if they weren't doing that that's part of that's part of the job part of my job job so when we talk about buying something or installing something or putting a concrete base down or something like so what's the PRI priority lwh hanging FL fruit that doesn't cost anything we just have to have the crew go out there and then what we make a list of the stuff that we say yeah that's right these benches do but we can't do it there so we have to how he prioritizes he priori that's why we send him these reports he reads over them and he picks and chooses because again that's his job which ones are a top priority which ones are more cost efficient to Pi and and he does that that's his job using information we just members of the community yeah that are helping him with the second pair of eyes to say you've already looked at the park ones where going to look at it again this is what caught our eye so it's the residents looking he's management so he could maybe look at the park and think it's okay but we're the ones who live here so we look at the park and we're like well it's okay except we don't like this so we're just probably helping him fine-tune the parks a little bit I have it if that makes sense no that's good that's that's that's what I'm that's what I'm trying so we don't have any budget or anything like that we don't have a budget to help him we're just strictly kind of an Advisory Group we do have a budget but not for fixing the park those those items so actually we have a budget for what no so we actually do have a budget so I do I do have a budget for Parks uh Park maintenance um but that's for all of our Parks I don't have a You Know M for hibiscus park or the seven street it's it's the overall right so I have to you know and I off the top of my head I can't tell you what I say it's 10 ,000 bucks you know I it's it's more than that because we have the M parks and all that but um I have to again prioritize you know on top of what we do on regular maintenance what we can do to fix things the benches you know those run about 600 bucks a pop how much about $600 that's what I thought yeah they're expensive um you know so I try to I mean if we could pressure wash them to make them look pretty again you know we do what we can to try to revitalize or um preserve what we have before we go out and and buy new Replacements um so but everything that you guys you know have brought up in these reports um it is listed down in fact on my whiteboard on my office you'll see you'll see the to-dos um and so outside of the scope of Public Works and even myself because I'll go out there and work as well outside of that Scope when we have that time we're caught up with other needs of the city um that's what we're working on we're working on the right now it's working on what the suggestions are from from the members to make the par look better okay I just I just wonder what exactly what the scope of our activities was and how into it it actually helps me at a lot you guys know I'm still new with this position going from one career that's completely opposite of this I'm looking for bad guys in one career now I'm looking for so it's a completely different thing so this actually helps me out a way more than you know okay yeah so thank you there guessing and so you have a Parks budget and then there is a park and wreck budget well I'm not sure if it's really called a budget I think it's a line item but I think that's how Kyle expressed it to me other words line item in his budget which comes under something okay so we are a line item so I think so I think that makes sense so being says we have the 2500 which is our total money for the year so if we're going to do a Halloween event which we probably should discuss next week next month we'll discuss that next month but you should discuss it even to see even if we're running in that direction or yeah yeah okay so merchandise updates I don't know that anybody is interested um I just did it here go um Renee is going to make up a couple of new forms for the merchandise update oh good um one that I can have and go in there and just January through December and then she's going to make one for the room so that every time somebody sells something they will Mark oh beautiful so I said you I asked her that today she said that would be great she doesn't mind doing that and that's that's good cuz I'm not a Excel person or so um but we have um one box which I think there's 50 in a box or of the big beach towels plus five in an open box we have 13 hand towels we have five khaki hats and three Blue Hats caps three license plates um three stickers seven welcome bags that look like completed welcome bags ready we have four cartons of Koozies plus 21 really I'll take no you should go guess my idea looking at me you're saying okay that's my idea kozies how many you got there I don't know too many I didn't buy them I know how many we got there's four cartons and there's probably at least 50 in each carton there's probably 100 200 of them who ordered them I have no idea well then why are we even going through the inventory maybe Tammy no Tammy were still here Tammy and Kyle I don't know I mean on something like that you could always if they're not moving you could just find out what the cost wasach bag yeah and and some that cost just to get that money back if you wanted oh that's probably what he was thinking there's um 17 water bottles and then 16 sets of the Christmas towels Plus One Singular towel so anyway pass the word that we got stuff to sell around your neighborhood okay uh maybe we should put that in the newsletter always always what always the merchandise is I thought it was always in the newsletter oh or maybe a list of the merchandise that's available we have I think on the website the merchandise is listed there's you talk to Kyle I don't have a say in this but maybe every now and then something on the reader board yeah that' be oh that's good I don't have a say on that one I think you should run a sale on those I do too I think every activity should be out summer special summer's coming up did you see the the reader board though how it looked Parks yeah looks better I've been able to read the whole time now yeah they changed that I don't know month or so ago me good job cuz ly kept complaining I couldn't read anything had people that complained to him so he told I know he told K I've been changing all of that thank you so much much better so much love it love it love it it's actually Pops that you see and yeah otherwise it's just like you had the big board meeting coming up yeah I like it okay other business I have a question for Beach cleanup let's see see it's May May 4th is my the is that okay with you are you still available I believe so okay I mean I know so all right and then June you're June also and Tammy was July and I said I would take it I will swap June and July with you if you're available cuz I will not be here in July on the 6 you want to swap May and June for July I can I can't swap may I can swap June okay I'm out of town in May I'm out of town in julye so for June for July yes June for July I will take June if you will take July are you here July 4th week no that's the only thing I probably won't be okay and you're not here I know right no and you won't do it I'll do it at 9: I won't do it at 8: I'll do it at 9: well I don't nobody comes anyway that's not true we had a huge turn all last time well you didn't send me any pictures how would I know I thought we did you them the last time you had no no we had we have eight or 10 or 12 eight 10 yeah yeah well I have no way there pictures I sent pictures to yeah there's pictures I sent pictures I sent pictures to her and they got sent over to keep you pronounce beauti all right need some bu for for July um for July think about I could ask I ask Tammy if she want might do it okay I'll ask Tammy I don't think we still have another could ask her I mean I don't think we can change it to 9: and 8 it's been eight for everything I think it would confuse the regulars that come all the time okay and it's July you want to be as early as possible in July that's that's why I wish this the beach clean up had been earlier this month oh when is the next Beach clean up Bridge you bridge is always at 9: I know when is the next one I don't know I have to look at up but I'm in the summer it should be at 8 not at 9: it's every quarter uh and we just have one so April so it'll be May June July August needs to be eight recommendation to your board thank you okay so anyway we got to check on this one when uh so that our schedule is does that run January or December or runs something like uh what our Beach schedule Yeah well yeah this is the one we had it for the whole year I thought December August when does it run out current schedule um the one I'm looking at right now just goes through August a August yeah and this was from our August meeting August 23rd meeting so so we'll we'll have to do September through December are you here then when are you here I'm not sure whether I'll be here for the October Beach cleanup or not I don't if I don't know whether I'm going to get here that early when is the when is that first Saturday I didn't bring I might be able to do that one uh first Saturday in October is the Fifth Fifth mhm I have to talk I have to talk to Brenda see when she wants to come back I don't I right now I'm thinking maybe not cuz I'm going to be coming back for about a week in June okay so I'm not sure but I'll definitely you know start taking and I don't I'll do them every Saturday morning every Saturday morning for the most part as long as I'm here uh my husband is going to have just have hip surgery then not in October but for July so okay yeah if you can't get October I'll do it you mean October you'll do or July you'll do no if you can't get anybody did I say both words if you can't get anybody for October I'll do it okay well we we've got still plan September October November December okay I'm not going to worry about it right this minute okay so well I guess in August that's a good time to we have our August meeting week July meeting yeah okay all right is there other business I want to ask you something I was going to come up and ask you during the week um because the munchkins went over really well that was great so we'd like to continue that and the small water what I would like to ask instead of that John normas cooler can we get a playmate you know what a playmate some it doesn't have to be the playmate brand but something yeah hang carry so that John doesn't have to put the top down to put the cooler in the car every time that should be no problem okay and we don't need like all we need is a does patty patty just can't lift it up wow Lloyd can't either that's funny no I'm just kidding yes we get it's just silly for that big old thing doesn't make any sense to tell you the truth we don't even need a cooler we don't need ice I mean just all you need we are in May June July and August can you guys tell us a little bit about your last Beach cleanup like you're saying you had a lot of people and you're saying you gave out munchkins now so yeah we got the right down here yes we had one L girl she must had 10 I do have one thing um because we've talk we were been talking about how do we get people out there heck I I I thought I thought I might be only person there quite honestly okay so one thing Kyle said and I noticed out here you know they the sign out here okay did say you know Beach clean up I don't know if that's the correlation I don't know no it says it has said it every month but the font is much better now changed the font everything looks so much more clear and you can read it okay so outside on that sign it was always being printed there but the font was funny and it was unreadable Aaron has changed it now and it's much more clear as you were able to see our board meeting was clearly listed there today so I bet people more clearly saw the bridge clean up so there Citizen and there yeah I meant the beach he runs them during you know uh and we did talk about getting signs like maybe four signs um oh just to put outside the beach M like like at 19th and maybe at this corner you know what I'm talking about like you know what you can do too is get like a beach cleanup uh like volunteer Beach cleanup City Builder Beach whatnot a metal sign we get magnetic um months and a number like at then then when there is something to come up you can just put on that's what we talking about with Kyle that that kind of sign it doesn't have to be metal or it can be that and just have a place for the the month and the you know first Saturday of every month have it over there have them at the beach uh the beach so far yeah well a couple down south a couple North and one at 19 like that oh entr like the sounds like we did for the garage sale man my brain was gone yeah those kind of signs well yeah we can even yeah do that or I mean even on a pole it's permanently there next Beach cleanup you'll put October 7th you know or something like that no way it's advertised so it has a calendar and we just move the well I don't know like I don't know if something permanent I don't know if I would want some Perman I but you know we just had that uh the clean up and I don't know how many people showed up to that we had about 15 um for some reason pelis um keep panel is beautiful left us off the list this this month when they posted it so Tammy followed up with that so that's maybe why we had less people this time but also there were about two or three organizations that came in recently and cleaned up before us I I think Largo did a cleaning so we were pretty clean it was there was a guy who cleaned everything before we even got out he was there was there with a broom yeah no no this biking guy was like well no wonder you were down to a couple of cigarette butts yeah I was going to ask if you missed those I mean it was that clean it was amazing he was out there by himself he was leaving bags he was sweeping the entire walkways of the bridge did a great job well I mean but but the point isn't just getting it clean the point is also you know the meeting people and all that stuff the whole issue of uh looking at the different techniques that we use you know is it the sign is that it is it because like uh penel county has a more effective uh or they have a larger audience okay I mean what is it that brings people or or causes them not to come to these things to me this would to me it's a uh yeah what I saw as a sign we had a good turnout I I I it has nothing to do with the donuts obviously has nothing to do with whether the water's cold I'm thrilled you had a good turnout or or who is or who uh you know Manning the event okay so the sign obviously was one correlation and it looked like it work okay is there anything else we have what the newsletter right and we have this thing that you do you know you notify your neighbors and stuff I'm not on that okay but that can't hurt the personal touch and well I do it every month for you guys I list it in two places for you every month I list it on Facebook H every month and I listed on next Store app every month okay and how many people are on that um there's about 85 people on the belir one it's just belir residence and there's only about 85 people on the Facebook version and in um next store it reaches probably I don't know about 1500 people local people maybe really and we don't we we really don't get that that the you know our big issue John is always the parking we can never do too much because of the amount of available parking it's a very tiny Community we we don't want too many right that's what I'm saying so you got to be careful where you print it where you've post it so it's on our website every month it's on the city website it's on belir uh the bbcf website um so yeah well I mean we had a good turnout so maybe it's like well it's just random I me when I first the first two or three years I mean I've been doing it ever since I moved here and you know we had only four one time but well I don't know but maybe they're maybe what we're doing is sufficient and that's just it's kind of random I guess I don't know keep getting 50 dut holes I got you variety I know by the way whatever you told that guy I'm going to tell you what they're waiting for me to get in there and they push the thing out there like that like you know you b beach I got to P anything like February oh I haven't got the bridge cleanup photo yet oh I just checked I had the beach clean up but no Bridge show him the her the beach clean up please all right let I see the beach we probably sent you the bridge did you not see the bridge with all the

without her is that enough three it's a quorum yeah it's a quorum so I think you could have a think you could have a meeting out believe so will you be sad yeah that's okay I mean what about the 14 yeah why don't we do the 14th we don't have we don't have that much going on now we don't we're not doing during the summertime it slows down we better to have everybody together 14 15 or 16 14th if you don't mind mind let me see what I have going on I will make myself available since you all did that to you got a pen of the bbcf that night that's okay thanks Mike all right so I have a board meeting that night as well so okay 2:00 okay uh-huh May 14th thanks thank you for helping me there guys no so that so who was the who made it and who second it we I'll make the motion okay okay second John approve I and it's at two yes 2 a.m. no P p.m. yeah p.m. I will not be here at 2 a.m. um I have a question for you I was supposed to follow up with the person from um the child trafficking mhm and we play tag a lot and I haven't spoken with her but I will try her again before I get away and try to handle that and then you and I discussed a public safety day so maybe we can we were talking about maybe having a day where we get to meet up my original thought was have the firemen cook lunch for us and we come in and interact with them and maybe give them donations they could put their fire boots out and make a little party cuz they really do a lot for us but they all do the cops do the sheriffs do so Aaron was saying it would be really nice for all the neighbors to meet all their public servants more or less that take um I don't know if that's the correct term but who take care and protect us and watch over us so it would be nice and he said maybe in the fall we can have something where we all have some sort of party outside where it's a greet and meet or something just something okay on that line I don't know if I need to do a a proposal or I'm not I'm not going to make a motion but I would prefer something like that over the Halloween event likewise later yeah I want to I want to beer so I want to be back so sometime after the middle of October well yeah the Halloween event would be but in place of that's what I'm saying talk about timing we got a large enough crew or a you know we don't have enough older children in this community or children to Warrant well it was more a pet than it was I and and then the pets were not able to accept yes enjoy what we were trying to do for them so they could come to this deal we' be we'd be having hamburgers and hot dogs they don't care about candy the dogs that's correct yeah but we had a lot of dogs that wouldn't even take our dog bones because they had P sniky bellies and know every own was like oh was it again you know okay but since we don't have a lot of children in the community and if we are going to have the firemen like maybe they could climb up on a truck maybe we could have a little face painter almost like a little why could youy kids for that yeah that's what she saying all right yeah yeah right right I mean I love see my grand kids in their adorable outfit yeah where are you going to parade them now I'll parade them everywhere I know you're going to have to find a good competition to go Inn so you would have you would have the firemen and the cops uh uh cook or how would you do that well well whether we cook or we bring in or we don't do food at all you know we'll see it's just something we were thinking do you guys like the idea I just said I like that idea I me I like the idea of having uh Community cooking is always it's always those things if they're they're nice to go to cuz you always mix you know you go over here to do this and you go over here to do this and some people are stationary other people are moving around and stuff like that it's a good way to try to get our neighbors in because that's the whole thing we haven't been able to get the participation there seems to be a divide that people who want to do things and the people who aren't happy so and we can't force them no but we can just offer them different things this is something different so I I would like to I I don't know if y'all two are working on it together no it was I talk a lot so I come up with these ideas and you know sometimes I just spit them out but and I have to listen yeah okay otherwise stream the the stream of I'm the stream of Consciousness okay so it's important by the way somebody's got to have idea do we have to ask anyone if we choose not to do the Halloween thing and also you only have to ask us okay and the Halloween doesn't require a lot of money what would that require would it be our budget would it be you know that's another thing and if we only have that 2500 I mean just talking about a briefly if if we were going to be honoring those folks I think it would be who less not to at least by hot dogs something that we I mean I'll cook up hot on yeah done before not with Parks obviously this was with the Hurricanes I had in a Hurrican 7 okay yeah last summer so it would be better in it in a fall okay yeah so you could have you could do some deal like a a public safety uh deal where you had a 15 minutes he talk for 15 minutes or something like that and there was kind of a uh you know food and drink was served you know hot dogs or something like that it's pretty we can if we plan it ahead of time enough I mean you know I know the fire department they brought their boat out they did a water demonstration I mean they did all sorts of different things just gather right down here at the park and look how nice that some hot dogs and cold pop or something well we October's still hot a lot of times but still so free food I mean free might to get I can't promise anything obviously but you I can talk to our deputies see if I get like the mrap squat you know Vehicles down there uh we could do emergency oper uh like the Emergency Operations folks that come out and there's a lot of different Public Safety out there that uh ambulance uh Crews well we don't want everyone at once because what happens if they're needed they're going to all have to have I'm sure they have well that happened at your Bridge clean be right yeah the here Beach kicking out trash and all of a sudden they started running it's cuz they had a call five or six of them yeah those guys ran back over they were helping us pick up trash they ran back over the bridge and got right in the truck and started putting it GE amazing okay so I say that we table that for next month okay that we can all be looking into it okay let's do that let's everyone maybe look Aaron maybe you since you have the contact yes I got some IDE maybe speak with Kyle about a date a potential date because City wall is booked a lot I think uh yeah we could figure that out certainly so October is well be when I board well that yes we were just saying maybe in place of that and what about the chili cook off is that not happening this year is that a par that's a Kyle question and a Dave question so John you're gone until when in October uh I don't have that's not solid I may last year it came back on like the second I still have if that's the case I'll U I'll try to I'm sorry oh this nothing he's messing with you said you said you'd be back on the second he said we'll have it on the first actually September might be a good month to do it like a back to school month you know think about that that's that's a doesn't work if got a deaf guy don't work with de guys I didn't get that you going adjourn well I think y'all have to make a motion to adjourn but I'm ready for you to make that motion I move we I move we adjourn I'll second it thank you all in favor all right let's hit the road"
