number two citizen comments a citizen would like to address the council about a topic not already on the agenda please raise your hand away from the column we ask if you limit your comments to no more than agreement but anyway yes sir come up to the podium and give us your name and your address how you doing Randy Leavitt's 13th Street first of all I'd like to say kudos to Mike Sable I in all my years of following politics locally he's the most proactive local official I've ever seen between the newsletters emails office hours everything else I mean it's just it's terrific I mean we have access now direct access constantly that we can get in touch with our community leaders of being done I think they've given everyone something to Aspire to I wrote you say thank you getting to the points I want to bring up few years ago a couple years two three years ago I came here and I complained about the benches on 12th Street access okay we used to have six and they upgraded the benches with these new resin benches where they're nice but we went down to three okay and they put a garbage can right or one of the benches was on the left hand side and they built a big Sand Dune up on the left-hand side towards the shower so really if you want to go with your wife or somebody and sit on the bench you're going to be looking through a hunk of sand with weeds okay we need we need more benches up here some mice that's very crowded and we end up standing you know behind the benches and everything I don't know why you can't get three three more benches up there and I brought it up at that time there's six benches sitting out here I never see anybody on the phone on the side right there so steal three of these and put them up there if it costs too much okay um you need a bike rack or something up here uh perhaps in the very very first space on the right hand side with a little white rack people come hiking up to the easement and they take their bikes and they chain them to the back of the benches with a handlebars sticking over into the bench area so of the three that are there and the two of them you can only see you can't really have the time to sit there because in bicycles are leaning up against there maybe there should be something to do with a simple bike rack that would help okay um two three years ago I came to a meeting and there was a big presentation here about adding one of these I guess animal or on taxes or something and the fire department from Indian Rocks Beach was here in mass and the chief was here and it made this big feel about you know instead of to help us out with paramedics or whatever over on our side instead of taking 10 or 15 minutes to dispatch somebody from Indian Rocks Beach and bring them up here you know they were going to raise our taxes and they were going to buy this building on the corner down here every time I go by there all I see is Hispanic guys they're loading grass and weeds and stuff in the back of trailers it looks like there's a running a lawn service out there I I really want to know did we ever buy that building was that building ever bought as a it was only a substation I think they called it the big screen was if you get a heart attack on 13th or 14th they're a minute away instead of coming all the way from Indian Rocks Beach so they raised our taxes and I don't see any any fruits of our investment then what happened with that building did we ever buy that Dolan thank you Mr Levitz we generally do not respond directly to Citizen comments this will give us time to think about your question let's talk to you later or at the end of the meeting that's fine okay um my other I'm sorry for a year out of time thank you very much that's it three minutes okay they're doing it again okay they're doing it again you should be aware of that raising the taxes and we're not going to get anything out of it all right now we're all into item number three which is law enforcement number four uh from Pinellas good evening Mr mayor council members staff citizens uh Deputy Steve clacker for the record uh first off I want to apologize I do not have a report for the Sheriff's Office activity I thought there was going to be a sergeant here this evening but I will double check on that and get it back to you all as far as a code enforcement uh again another visiting month uh keep it busy with a lot of violations and and the nice thing is that people are now really inclined in a short period of time getting things completed one of the other things that Kyle's going to be bringing up will be met with commissioner Roberts my supervisor Sergeant Jason stiver Laura and myself for a little meeting dealing with the code enforcement issues I think went very well I think Kyle's going to speak about that later on this evening other than that um everything's going well and uh I will tell you that my my messages on my phone have pretty much stopped so evidently we must be doing something out there correctly because we're not getting any too many complaints out there so that's my report and I'll stand for any questions councilman yes thanks America how's it going today good how are you I looked at the monthly coding enforcement report 6 out of 28 million numbers 21 of them reference ordinance 22-33 okay typically non-view event and there's no explanation there I had to go into the code to look up and see just for the edification of everybody and our viewers and the council could you just specify what that is and why the focus and which yes that that deals with mainly Landscaping Rush trees if I get a again we have a lot of vacant Hots here that are overgrown so what I will do is I'll get with either Laura or Kyle and find out who the property owner is and then what we'll do is we'll make a notification it doesn't have those those issues taken care of people that are done pretty quickly we do have a couple little issues uh one is out on I believe it's six three where there's a house that is vacant it's in Probate the motor impact and I'm trying to get a hold of somebody in the family to take care of some vegetation mainly trees growing over onto the properties next door that um that one location and it does take a little bit of time because again trying to get a hold of a contact or or actually talk to a family member in this particular case I two messages with the daughter of the mom who owned that house and she hasn't returned my phone calls so our next step is we're just going to show violation and then cite cite the homeowner and then go from there other issues that we're seeing is the I'll give you an example up on Donato I have one house up there that has approach or Bush's taller deep trying to get them again most of these people around the state try to make contact either with the property manager or whoever's handling that property and trying anything to take care of those those issues but all in all it's been pretty successful and some of those those complaints have been doing without yeah um pull back a hurricane we had some power outages but I think it was what fifth or sixth street we had some or because there is a banyan Creek probably the largest tree in Bel Air Beach it basically has surrounded encapsulated uh power lines going through there that thing has to be cut period coming from Maryland you have to do proactive cutting this tree has caused our energy beforehand it's got to be stopped you got to stop the tree before it does it again right um do you know about this this giant banyan tree oh no I do not but I can look into it but I will tell you what Duke Energy there was one house up on 15th we had the same problem where they cleared out a lot uh the people are actually clearance a lot had to stop because I had to get a permit from Duke Energy before they perceived any further because of the the actual trees growing into the lines itself and I will tell you that that's been going on for a month and it's still from what I understand the permit has not been approved this one's going to be stopped uh you got that plus you got line power lines are about 10 foot off the ground I mean I went over because I got photos on Sunday so we gotta gotta get a game plan to adjust this for the residents who's powering yeah is it in the easement together I don't know they'll come out and they'll assess the trailer yeah get this one really got to be cut back and then Danny you're talking at least 80 quiz it's huge and I believe the property of that song has Runners on it you know this will perplexity but I'm sure we can do it yeah because there was one that there was a uh Australian pie and then we finally had oh yeah and that took a little bit of time you're a legend with that one yeah yeah okay thank you very much uh but yeah we'll look into it sorry appreciate it removed yes for what reason uh two reasons number one there was a nuisance is those Australian pines the needles come off uh it was naturally on approximately owner's side and uh because of the needles that were falling it was going through somebody else's Screen through their pool and um she had that taken care within about two weeks well I mean excuse my French bitching about an Australian or north of pine for at least four months now on 8085 Harbor Drive got to be at least at least 85 feet tall and it has done damage to a neighbor's uh full screen three neighbors have complained about one of them just moved the mayor's been out on that site um it's leaning there was an Arbors down on that site so it's it's possibly waiting to have to see any exciting or issue hey what was the address on that I believe it's 805 today in my there was a house there they threw the house down probably five years ago councilmember two I'll address this this is uh the 805 Harbor yeah um so they so with the Australian pine we actually own that immediately because it's on the obnoxious with the state so for the code it was a violation I did speak with you energy about the claim that they were going to remove that tree that's not accurate apparently a resident called took energy out to assess a trio was in the easement behind their house and then made another report to assess that tree but given that it's on private property it's not something that they're going to address so I did clarify that it's it's there's not interested but we've kind of heard that there was a letter sent off but we still have an art ordinance a nuisance tree citation or vial of code and we could say that however so the Avenue that we discussed now as I'm getting a proposal to kind of do a hazardous tree sweep in the city to be fair and assess all the trees into a random all right well God thank you for uh bypassing us on that storm a week ago but uh that storm when it came up here that tree would have been in somebody's house any other comments from the council thank you very much we have someone from from the sheriff's department are you prepared to address the Council on a report he's coming here okay all right thank you very much I'm sorry we don't we don't address the citizens do not address the test scores thank you thank you all right and well I'm assuming you uh University um yes any event that as far the rest of them on this report yes would you like to get started and they will pass the torch so this is the report that covers the month of August for law enforcement contract just going to summarize but we have reported here you can see and what device we have one more vehicle theft I don't have any background there okay Sergeant would you like to come up and address the counter where we'd like to hear your report yeah so sorry for being lazy usually this meeting is on the first Monday of the month we also have an assignment with La Crosse in their city where I'm supposed to be there at six o'clock so he will give you a pass this time thank you very much sir uh for the August report for uh Bellaire Beach there was one motor vehicle theft on the first page there's no other UCR Prime stats for that page the second page there's nine arrests for total of 12 charges on individuals in Miller Beach during the month of August on the third page there are 940 events requiring 1070 Deputy units responding to those events the final pager is one crash within the month of August New York City and a combination of 214 citations in the market is issue thank you I'm curious about the auto theft leave their keys in their car I might have to lift that up and get back to you I do not know about this meeting until questions thank you very much thank you sir all right next we have a presentation from Florida League cities council members Judy Shirley and Mike Sable please join me on the floor foreign [Applause] legacies I am pleased to award to you Mr Tiffany for completion of The Institute of elected Municipal officials 2 and that happened in Fort Myers on September of the 16th and 17th 2022. first remember Jody Shirley [Applause] up next council member Mike [Applause] happy birthday is the second class of four available and uh before a child welcome all right we are on to item number five uh that is the quarterly board reports do we have a report from the board of adjustments come on state your name and that's here good evening Mr Mayor Mike Kelly I'm the chairman of board of adjustment and I got three quick things to talk about this past quarter we have resignation from the board in May in the bay and you folks replaced that person's severe now a full mortgage seven you replace them with David Ardell in the month of July the month of August we had a hearing a member of the board who accused himself that was the applicant on Donato Drive had to bring up the head coming for us for variance regarding on on what we all consider a bad ordinance a bad code the board the actual issue regarded the height of a swimming pool above the crown of the road Jody you and I and several other people talked about this not long enough when we didn't throw a revision a couple years ago and we want to bring it back to council but it goes work session first it's an issue that can bring other people into requirement for the variants on Fourth living pools third issue that's coming up Thursday we have a hearing we're going to be helping out the interim city manager with an issue where a person has appealed one of his decisions so we have administrative hearing coming up not primary and slowly for an appeal so that's it reported this quarter thank you very much Mr Kelly Council any questions comments hi just for the audience could you just quickly review what that appeal was for yeah the person that wants to tear down an existing home on 22nd Street and put up a three-story home which is not permitted in our city it's either written in the actual ordinance that you can't even ask for a variance for that and the interim city manager has made made a decision and presumably Kyle if the man has asked where do I go from here and we are going to hear his case on Thursday night the issue is that the structure has is proposing three habitable Force where we're allowed to above above the garage or adjacent to a garage but not three it was 55 foot tall homeless three stores have open floors I'm curious new homes a two-story is the limit new homes you build a garage you're allowed to build habitable a story on the ground and you're still allowed to do that it's written above the garage yeah you have to be above the vfp or you know so you can have a garage you have to have the force above it you can also have two out of fours before Mayors as this board member is going to be at the hearing on Thursday and to observe the Integrity of that process site request that we don't get any work done discussing in particular to the code thank you very much just one question on the pool period what was the outcome of that the fragrance was granted this particular code was written in revised in 2014 at the time of that revision there was a lot of controversy about it I remember physically being here with our city engineer and with the mayor at that time who stipulated that he only wanted it 18 inches above around the road which we all thought was wrong should have been higher and the way it's written any new pool especially in these new homes are being built these pools you know be built way higher than 18 inches above the crown on the road and every single case will have to be reviewed at the city level on the management city manager and we think that Council should look at it we should all discuss it again because when you and I are on that code board we skipped over we talked about it but we didn't have enough discussion at that time thank you very much sir all right next up is the citizen advisory committee good evening bear Ross again we order that once this month we met on September 21st to discuss uh potentially for a live credit for Emergency Management purposes of the committee agree to follow up and do some co-work regarding that so Intercity manager 34 and I have been talking with the last banks that we did support issues with as well as the last Bond Council to Gathering costs fees at uh options so that's where we are and we'll recapine the committee that further discussion great Council thank you very much Mr Speaker all right do we have a report from the parks and rec board um for people who are watching it like the mics aren't working on Zoom so like if they're watching if people are watching

Bella Beach logo items for sale at this event in time for Christmas and then last but not least the health and wellness fair is January 14th from 10 a.m to 2 P.M the third thing that we worked on this last quarter um I kind of call it our areas of need checklist was put together by our board member surveys of our Parks and Rec parks and Beach accesses this continues to be reviewed and updated and thank you to the city staff for all their help and getting this done the fourth item that we will review is the easement survey questions procedure and example you guys all have rough draft number one in front of you in your packet so I know you tasked the park and rec board at a work session to try to get feelers out in the city and Kyle and I met on this and we were thinking the best way to do it to get a well-rounded survey is to hang door surveys at everyone's house now we were not interrupting them we're not knocking on doors we're not mailing something and then if they truly want their opinion to be known they will definitely answer the survey so they can drop it off at City Hall during business hours or they can drop it in the mail slot in the back Black Box by the entryway near the parking lot so what I would like to do is just briefly I don't know if you guys had a chance to read this yet but I want to make sure that all of the council agrees and these questions are clear and succinct and you think we're going to get a well-rounded survey because we don't want to pass out the survey and then have it you know these weren't good questions or I'd rather have your sample approval before we do it and then you guys are all happy and it's just the results are what they are so it's just four questions number one are you aware of the 10-foot grass easement that runs that runs in 2nd Street to 18th Street and Bellaire Beach you will be shocked at how many people do not know that it exists would you be interested in the city Paving the easement at a cost of 200 to 250 000 oh these are all yes no um number three if no would you like to see the easement improved by some other means um for example shell geocell ground grids Etc yes or no number four would you like to see the easement left as is yes or no and then there's a comments section and like just if you're talking to people about this in general people bring up things all the time that like I never thought of so I thought it would be a good idea if they could just one or two liner especially if they feel very strongly about it they don't particularly want to come to a council meeting it's a way for them to do something other than yes no and then just their address so you know and then if we wanted to get an address not so much a name but an address so we make sure that we don't have duplicates so they just have to put 97 Harbor Drive and then um and then at the oh and then it has instructions at the bottom please submit your survey by December 31st at the Bellard Beach Community Center after hours submit through the March outgoing mail slot on the back pedestal mailbox at the back at the back entrance of the building thank you Valor beach park and rec board in the city of Bellaire Beach and then at the bottom of that I did a little perforated line so of course we've got to get our our info in which is some save the days that they can cut off the bottom I figure if we're walking door to door for every single residence I would like for like to get a little info about our events so anyway I would love your input and if you don't want to do it right now I mean you can email Kyle or text me or email me but what do you guys think so far Craig Baker is there any way we could do electronic ballot through our website we only hit about 300 people so we can um but we talked about that we don't hit nearly enough people well we have that sign now um you can put it on the sign you know about the easiest because I I agree with you a lot of people don't even know the easements exist right we talked about putting it on the sign we talked about putting on the city website we just don't hit enough people I mean we could do it at the beach cleanup we could assign you know randomly we get done it out on the bridge but then there's no way to ensure that we don't have duplicates there's no way to ensure that we get a good like you know if you go in specific sections of the city you can get all yeses or all knows and that's what I wanted to avoid I wanted it to be like a good representation of the entire city if we could get it believe me I would love door to door and hang these I mean it's not something that we typically do but you guys task us with this and we want to do a good job and we want to get all the information that we can we can't council members say uh yeah I I really like what you've done here and uh tell you what behind this I got a list of I sent out an email to over 611 people about every two weeks you know through the hurricane et cetera but I'll send out your service to that thank you again have you considered uh possibly taking a survey or polling at your event we can but you know typically we have um 20 people if we have like 50 to 100 the kids you know what I mean it'll just be the parents at the Halloween event we were not sure if the numbers of the chili cook-off were hoping it's very well attended but we just don't know we can but then we have to make sure that we don't do duplicates if we do the hangers on the door so if you guys don't like the hangers on the door if my example's email list can hit 611 residents it's more it's a bigger number than I've heard in the past with the constant contact like the three whatever it was was the last update I had but that's about what was that half the residents or three 300 some years no my yeah mine's at least yeah yours yeah no I counted mine today 611. and there are no duplicates like the husband the wife on separate emails or anything like that that's something you really can't tell because of everybody's behind at hotmail.com you know good luck but I would say the majority of those are you know about attaching anyone not dupes yeah it's up to you guys I mean door-to-door we're gonna have to enlist as many volunteers as we can because of the parking record it will take a month for us to hit every single house walking up and down we're going to kind of do it like the slopes do with the flags and try to get that many and sign everybody two or three streets and then it'll go in like 20 minutes Mr Savannah I I don't think that there's a single council member here who hasn't hung so so you'll find plenty of Volunteers in this group okay are you guys good with the questions you think it's a fair and I think we're really getting I do not leave those questions no it's a very good respect when you got the notes section and you got the address to elimination Floyd Roberts the only thing I was thinking about as one of those people that really didn't know there was an easement there would there be any value you think and letting the people know on the door hanger as to what some of our citizens use that easement for you know it may help them to think well why would we want to pay two hundred thousand dollars to improve it not better with which is something that you guys are probably way more aware of and I'm sure it's used for jogging bicycling football games whatever people are using that he's been poor that we say but here's some of the things the easement is currently being used for by our citizens if anything well this is just my opinion and we've kind of talked about a little bit but I think that's kind of leading because like on the flip side of it I could also list well leaving it as it is now it's the only place where I can walk my dog where they won't bring their paws when it's 110 degrees out and it's on the concrete or we don't have sidewalks but you're not walking them on the street so if I listed all the good things for having it I would have to list all the good things for not having it does that make sense it does at least in my head like so I felt like if I we the first list of questions that I wrote some of them I thought were kind of leading like um so whoever's writing the survey there you should not be known in the survey and I feel like if we put all of the things that it would be good for then we're being leading it just went I mean I just passed that though just to your point nowhere on here does it say it's a walking instrument and clearly it's a walking instrument and it's been called that for the city for years oh I can add that yeah so back to your point because it just sounds like we just have an easement of some sort that randomly runs through the city right yeah I'll put that in a title like walking the easement survey yeah another another suggestion might be uh obviously there's blank space on the back it might be a map of where it's at yeah uh certainly I think the most vocal people are going to be the people that are most impacted but um everyone needs to be aware if they're not aware of these where to have yeah that's a good idea we can do that show the entire everybody see who line you can focus on these resources that you're considering but I show the entire reason because people are obligated a lot of people don't know what's there if they don't live near it or even I know people that live on like the streets where they have it yeah if you're updated you have my email and uh phone number just call me shoot it over and then I can send it when you're ready well do you think that we should do both so people have the option to either email it back in through you or drop it off at the city because then they will definitely the people that you have 600 will get it twice because we don't know like a direct there's no absolutely I could let them know too you know maybe on your door Etc but please you know vote regardless and then to vote you can drop it by yeah I think that's great yeah yeah it's hard because if um if they work during the day I mean they can drop it off in the mail slot but honestly I had no clue where the mailbox was and I've been here yeah I'm going to work for the hurricane prep when I sent out those emails so it should work very well for this purpose from the council um that number 200 250 000 is that a pretty conservative number um because that's like twelve thousand dollars a block you know that's just the last number I heard and I could put more I could put a bigger number I just put I mean I could put whatever number you guys want me to put in there to it's buying a conservative side I just wanted to make sure that we were doing an accurate number to cover the cost yeah I'm just saying the oils open another ten dollars a barrel a week uh black coffee as well yeah anyone else oh thank you very much so we're going to proceed with this yes okay perfect thank you okay all right so two more things okay number five um as the Bellar Beach Community Foundation board has been working on the nonprofit launch we have been discussing and giving our input to the interim city manager Kyle weedler on the brick program discussed later in the agenda we spent quite a bit of time on that the last two months of meetings and I would just like to say a quick thank you to Kyle riefler from both the park and rec board and the Bellair Beach Community Foundation for his time and attention with everything we were trying to accomplish he did a very understandably told us that he didn't have time as he is doing two jobs and managing so many manners that are higher on the priority list he's doing an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate everything he needs to me for our city thank you does anybody have any other questions for me um just we had a citizen talking about benches needed at by the beach accesses I'm not sure if we were able to place benches but would that be something maybe the foundation could look into selling benches and having them placed were needed throughout the city and see if it was if we can place them on the beach access yes um we have all of those on there so there'll be benches bike racks of when he was speaking I thought you know the official launch of the foundation will be at the November city council meeting so we'll have a table at the Halloween event we're going to have a table at um and we're going to chili cook-off will be sponsoring the dessert table and we're going to be doing a wrap hole so yes absolutely so that's the thing we could have launched a month ago but we've been working on the website to make sure we get as many programs like that as possible and then that's some of the things that we've been working on with Kyle to make sure that the city it's up to standards on everything that you guys have already approved so but for sure more information on it next okay anything else no I'm good you guys are Hamilton thank you very much okay thank you all right and uh this quarter we did not have a report from the planning and zoning all right item six let's see the attorney's report Mr Moore a humanitar Florida thank you Mr Mayor um it's been a quite a busy month this last month Insurance manager on a number of matters and many of which are on the agenda this evening one of the things that you should expect and follow up to our last meeting I do have almost a complete draft of the proposed sign code before I circulated to you I want to have an opportunity to speak to the Insurance manager about its content format make sure it aligns with the general aim of the community before I circulate it and if there's any particulars that can be taken into account and resolved on the front end relation for the realities on the ground otherwise excuse me this community did in an excellent job in preparing and responding to the hurricane preparedness I will tell you you know for the benefit of the residents that both the manager and the mayor were in contact with me immediately Monday morning following the counties just Declaration of an emergency a Saturday so that we were prepared to mobilize any necessary resolutions resources and otherwise so [Music] um well done on that one otherwise I have nothing to add but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have and also can I tell you um yes Mr Nora have you been able to take a look at that email disclaimer suggestion I brought out you'd put on all of our city emails uh yes I have I I will tell you that I'm I'm trying to balance as each of you are are committed public servants and I'm also mindful of a lot of the direction you gave me as as I started this position on doing work for the collective as opposed to individuals I did receive your requests I did I did forward draft options to enter manage a reflur he and I as we discussed it he suggested depending on the Bevy of things that were being put on the agenda tonight that maybe that would be something that would be addressed tonight but I do have options I am prepared to speak to that if that is the will of the body to that same end the last meeting and I would have addressed it my report but I want to make sure since it has been added as an agenda item I have had some contacts with a senior advisor program and can substantively update when we get to that agenda item that has been happening thank you other questions from the council thank you very much Mr Moore thank you item seven Union City Manager to report Mr rieckler thank you mayor and Council started off we got the 12 and 13th Street project that was scheduled to start on September 26th hurricane Ian put us back a week and actually started uh occurred since breaking ground and getting down to some of the actual utilities we've discovered some some utility conflicts and uh so we uh we were working around a couple laterals we discovered a four inch water main if you remember the video camera of Paul Street there was a pipe that was going through one of the RCP that turned out to be a water main we initially thought it was a store lateral but so there's a workaround offset line item in the uh in the contract to utilize to get around that one one thing that was not in contract is um we can't work around we can't offset the sewer line four inch pipe that's directly behind that in this case we're going to have to get the receivers working on a proposal from the contractor to have a change order for the conflict box so I hope to have that put together this week and to address I'll show up for our schedule in our work session next Monday but hopefully a special meeting to address that um another thing that we ran into is we discovered on the north side of 12th Street between the easternmost Inland there is pipe that did not the surveyors didn't pick up so we discovered about 112 feet of 15-inch RCP when it was discovered I got the camera crew in there to analyze the pipe because I knew if it's something we're going to add to our line item 15 inch RCP that we want to recognition of it we did go in there after the camera footage and Report um but it was very much so um probably even worse than the rest of the RCP but just so you can see what your own eyes did set into the engineering firm they recommended that it gets replaced in that case it's going to be 112 foot overrun which we do have a line item for which is a 120 dollars per linear foot so if that cost of looking at about 13 and a half thousand additional for teenage RCP which that will come out of our 10 built-in contingencies which they at 65 000. so just to kind of keep in mind of what we're doing on that project I will have all these numbers to present to you obviously when we do the change order hopefully be next Monday especially as far as the young adult full of our underground project currently utility Consultants of Florida or out there through preliminary conversations with the residents on Golf Boulevard for probably now called our Duke Energy is requiring easements for the Transformers for the underground to take place so it's a 10 by 10 foot easement again utility Consultants are providing residents preliminary information they do not have the legal contracts at this point but we are giving them information and providing pictures to give them an idea of what they're expecting to come um the 7th Street and 16th Street Seawall and 7th Street boat ramp renovation project that's moving along nicely now that we got started and we received at a permit from the county area right now so they are driving vinyl sheepiling and it said the anchors at both sites and uh and having a meeting meeting with contractor and the engineer assigned they are actually going to work with us at the end pull out the check valve that we recently replaced now at 7th Street when they extend that pipe out they're going to fit it in and actually build that extension over that valve itself so it'll be a nice Titan bit they're going to do the same with the 16th Street c-ball which we did not have a valve into that place so we'll after this project we will have a valve in place and we'll be looking for us and we're down nicely as far as the 17th and 18th Street stormwater project still in the design phase I did receive a proposal from Dual Associates recently we've had resident inquiry into the stormwater timeline it inspired me to kind of update it show everybody where we're at that's why I sent that out to you just to give you an idea of a little bit of history of the products that have taken place and where the budgets were adjusted and where we're at now I contacted Rossi Knight for the citizens advisory committee about that timeline and we'll actually discuss further because as part of what they were charged but it was looking into options into funding projects possibly lines are excited moving things along for the city wanted to kind of get his opinion a possible options for moving along in our capital projects we plan on meeting this week and uh just as a start if you look at that timeline we're we're funded not only for 17th and 18th Street but also for the next project which is going to be 1920s so the funding is actually in there in the budget and um you feel like Eric started talking to dual Associates at some of the other engineering forms because I'd like to get some competitive pricing uh are you talking about giving us a proposal for the first project and the proposal for our two projects is to see if we're out of that our code enforcement analysis project we met on September six I went very well I think we were in there for probably three and a half hours I remember correctly and we got a lot of insight from Steve's uh football hits Sergeant um I'm talking sticker uh the first time I met him but he was actually he was a line because I did a lot of background in community policing and he was very helpful to have a community so from that meeting we talked a lot about ins and outs of code of course not a lot of challenges that are faced to different communities and we thought our next step was going to be to fill out our residents and since then we've got to put together a uh a survey that we're planning on sending out this week via the constant contact UM got a couple more tweaks I'd like to make to it for functionality but send that out on a deadline for the end of the month to get some some solid feedback on what's important to the residents and hopefully maybe identify the different geologic geographical areas of the city and see where maybe what's important in one area that differs from another and then from there we're going to reconvene and talk strategy and how we're going to reach what the goals of or meeting the expectations of the residences um the City Hall Seymour Seawall project I now that we have the funding and the budget I said we had the uh thirty thousand dollars that's in the capital projects fund I want to go out back out and get a preliminary estimate from you're going to try Enterprise Marines at the um Seawall there on Belle Isle to just kind of feel around if we're in the correct ballpark before going out to bid just to make sure you know if it's going to come back higher um kind of reassess it look where we're going to be able to go up a bit what the numbers are going to be um children's playground still in back order some other projects that we have coming up we uh in this new budget here we have the new admin assistant I am in the process of taking old admin assistant job descriptions and coming up with our current description of what we're going to need to advertise another project that is fully funded as of October one is the community center generator I was going to check back with that contractor and make sure the numbers are still online but I'd also like to bring this um as an overall Emergency Management item and a work session to consider some of the needs we have at the city for Emergency Management agency if it's my best spent and on this backup generator or if there's something that is more beneficial to our residents underneath for an emergency and we could possibly use that money for it and I believe that covers everything Council Frank Banker first of all Kyle command you on the excellent job you did preparing the city for this storm people saying you're doing two jobs this man actually is doing three jobs the last two days he was physically filling sandbags loaded them in people's cars we are so blessed with the staff that we have including the swollen right there and the women that work in that office um I really believe that all you deserve opponents for giving up on Sundays last year they gave up the July 4th weekend our field staff doesn't live here so a live increase called in sick and said you know I got my own house to prepare but they did came here and they did an excellent job I'm sure I guess till 6 30 Monday night get a little good and everybody got sandbags we had plenty of sand left um I think when we left I think we still had like 15 bags filled ready to go but um did I give you correctly that there's 112 feet of reinforced concrete pipe on that project over there didn't come up on the original survey correct and that that job just got I think I think we uh voted four to three gas today and I commend you Mr Mayor because you pushed it ahead I'm never into patching construction sites and 80 year old pipes need to be replaced um is there any chance on that seventh street now when you go in there can you raise that about 60 inches to a foot or would that just throw off the hole um well you know with the criteria flow on that I guess that valve is too low right now and there's still water comes in the street it does close but I understand that I believe that would be a completely at this point change the scope of the project I can I can ask an engineer opinion on that I don't know about the Integrity of the other plate that would be you know compromised or not but it would be would be beneficial official degree too and there was an email sent out on October 4th by a resident about a sign on the beach the tortoise uh the more properties I don't know if you got it yeah I don't know they said it was on public beach fortune and no trespassing time I'm a little bit leery on any signs on beaches there's two down at 28th or first straight Belair Shores get a good Windstorm who knows where they're going do they have to be permitted by the county that is the state's territory State territory okay so when I when I first was aware that I've signed I contacted the fdep and they told me it was it was allowed for their standards it was allowed with a single pulse sign thank you again he talked about the emergency character so take 30 seconds here and set the stage for what the alternative foreign some of the things I've been looking at is a are sending procedures this last storm really tested us on we had to put out more sandbags in a shorter shorter amount of time than we ever had since I've been here I've ever heard of in the history of our sandbag station we went through about 5 000 bags and a matter of two days and um it seemed like we you know we were backed up we tried to regulate the traffic uh but it would definitely be something to improve on uh finding better means and I did some research on did you make a stand bag of manufacturing tools and they also make attachments to uh that would fit on our tractor to make 20 sandbags at a time I think this is something that we should look into the prices on them earn yours the attachment being about ten thousand dollars and then some some really nice sand batting tools processing where you scoop a bucket and put the stand on the top and it pretty much produces sandbags that runs a little bit higher about 20 25 but just options to consider what works best for us another uh idea it would just be if we get a way to more easily make sandbags to to build some kind of shed storage facility somewhere on property where we can palletize cinematics and have them available for residents when in need and I think some of our production levels and our ability to hand out send or our access to head out standard bags when the demand is high what we might solve a lot of the problems that we were facing just my second thing is you've got some big projects in playing here and you're doing a great job you're running at 120 on a lot of these things so my question is you're wearing two hats right now so you know my observation is anything in touch you do it in 100 you don't back off on anything if anything your maximum focused my concern is you're trying to cover two jobs right now your plate is running over give me some idea of what your concerns are that you're not capable of getting to your full attention what are those things that could fall off the player that you're concerned about um thank you for asking me my primary concern would be my um my attention and supervision that I can give to the public works staff that's uh recently with taking on the additional responsibilities I feel like they could use a little more of my time I I do try to communicate with them as much as I possibly can but I would like to be more involved with some of the things that they're doing and also um training I feel like I'm I could be doing more training with them just having out the uh the time to be available with my uh it's just concerned that it's not it's so not sustainable over a long period of time I mean just we're getting by and they're doing a great job really picking up a slack in every way possible and I commend them for that they typically don't go all the way to to ask something if they need to have something important they need to know another concern of mine is just the overall uh project management we're trying to move things along we're trying to keep products going but um find any time to get out in the field and um just monitor what's going on with the projects it's a concern of mine and uh what I hope that it's been apparent to the council but all I've been trying to do is not just uh keep the city afloat and hold on I'm trying to keep us moving forward or trying to accomplish uh yeah I prefer going further uh I want to thank you for everything you've done but I want to point out uh councilman Banker but I want to thank you and we're both out there multiple days shoveling a whole heck of a lot of sand um but that brings up something I guess I showed you the list of these things is we're going to be recommending here in the short-term future is taking that sandbag filling station out of that area because it was just a one-way Street pilot and that's not fair to the citizens we have a perfectly good Marina that we use increase to maybe three stations you could sneak the traffic in there and it doesn't hurt the citizens but more importantly if you haven't looked around lately we're not a really young Community we don't have a bunch of weightlifters out there I know about councilman Becker myself we had we were delivering to other people but we don't have a list of senior citizens and they can determine firm that can't do their own sandbags and what I like to do is the doctor put it later is we get together kind of a core of some citizens that can actually get a list of people that need the sandbag Services we come out first time get them take them deliver them and then install them for the people but uh I'll give you the four points out later like I said you've already seen some of the basis of it so sometimes with the same big situation going forward I guess um Kyle so you mentioned the 15 inch I guess it was elliptical concrete pipe yes that they came across where approximately was that located okay so the um we're at the corner of 12th and Bay uh you have an mcf a CDS unit on the south corner and then if you go to the West you have an inline and that's where all the pipe was on the planet but if you take that Inlet you go across the street to the north side the matching Inlet of the Cross pipe underneath um from that Inlet to the West on the north side of Toll Street for the first two inlets there because honoring both feet of connecting 15 inch RCP it kind of completes a big circle right they didn't know how that was there yeah actually I think they did have a conversation with the engineer on that particular drawing and I pointed out that it did not make logical sense with respect to the pipes and didn't show a pipe and he he goes he finally agreed yes there should have been something shown there but um more importantly so you said that you felt like when they videoed that pipe it was not in good condition was that the pipe itself or was it more of the joint it was the pipe itself this time there was a lot of cracking and leaking a vertical cracking okay but I will provide that to you okay that'd be great but I took a look at it I'm not an engineer but I I thought it wasn't worse than the other yeah yeah I did actually stop there on I think Sunday evening and I saw some of the pipe they had in fact taking pictures and um it was late in the afternoon I watched a few football games had some beverages but it was pretty good like it's in pretty good shape that particular stuff that was filed there but probably most importantly typically an engineering firm will have errors and emissions insurance so we need to definitely look into that because it should have been their responsibility to identify that and have it in the plans and that's what that insurance is for so the contractor is going to come back now and say change order to be a builder of each Euros money which we're going to have to come up with but if it falls underneath the category of areas and omissions from the design engineering firm that's what they have that insurance for so we need to make sure we ask them about that and their insurance could cover our additional cost to where we don't have to pay that that's a good point you know really excited we don't have accurate maps of our infrastructure it's it's a little shocking to me actually because we're old but we're not that old so um I guess as we move forward maybe we should have those drawings updated and have more engineering at least something to reference because it low sounds to me like we completely drop the ball somewhere in our history on that one particular pie the next thing I would like commit everyone who participated in bag in the sand however I will say that this is 2022 and there are alternatives to regular old changes um I don't know the cost yet but I want to share a product with you that that I came across and those were my sandbags where you just take the black black bag out of a box This Tall soak it in water and it becomes a water barrier for the water and you can store literally thousands over in a very small place again I don't know what the cost is but when you look at the amount of Labor and the critical nature and also the fact that as as Mr Banker described that there are people out there that are unable to help themselves so this would be a master way to get those sandbags out without having so I'll share that with you and uh and we'll see if it's something that it may be a solution for Billy beads going forward in the future great great job a great report Mr Mayor any other comments yes well I've been here eight years I'm not sure how long you've been here eight years ago we used to have no lock on the sand thing over there at night um and our former city manager said it was contractors come in and stealing some of the stand so that's why you lock it up but maybe from like May 15 to October 15th we could have one day a week now I'm sure no one will probably use it you know we just don't you know wait until the hurricane you know before they go without saying maybe one day a week they could come over and just fill the sand if they wanted because I was over there one night the sheriff came up and says you know something that we don't know just get prepared you know but um the other thing this really works used ad and um what you probably know is the quick stuff the phone battery around it when Hurricane Sandy came up they ran out of sandbags in New Jersey the ones that had dabbed and the dad comes off easy to put stuff never does Quick Time completely sealed uh self-importance yeah I agree that that quick stuff I'm still scraping off I can't get rid of it any other questions or comments for the interim city manager all right let's move on to number eight let's see first before um mine was just the hurricane we were surprised at how much we had to pack and move and get up high and then cover for anything that came in from up top and and then we were here the very next day and unpacking and putting everything back in place everything had to be moved so that that was good and then the next thing is the board of adjustment hearing that chairman Kelly talked about so we'll be having that and then last time we talked about the liens that have been filed and so those three that are listed have been paid and the only one that we haven't heard back on yet is uh the 16th Street one so we should get that back any day now right Council just thank you Patty for staying late and tonight's citizens today you're very welcome and I'd like to thank you for uh for getting these uh these minutes thank you anyone else thank you very much all right we are up to the consent agenda covering items 9 through 14. this is for approval of the July 19 2022 special city council city manager search meeting minutes approval of July 28 2022 special city council city manager search meeting minutes approval of August 1st 2022 special city council managed research meeting minutes approval of September 7th 2022 city council meeting minutes approval of September 19th 2022 city council work session minutes and for authorization to execute the interlocal agreement between Pinellas County and the City of Bellaire Beach providing for joint control of pollutants within Pinellas County that being said do I have a motion for approval of the consent agenda motion second made the motion Tony Shirley and the second all in favor aye any opposed all right the consent agenda Passage all right now we are on to the regular agenda so 15 consideration of ordinance 22-04 first reading Mr Mora would you happily Mr Mayor is ordinance number 22-04 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending the city's code of ordinances to repeal Provisions establishing a Gulf of Mexico safety zone in order to conform to applicable state laws and regulations establishing a vessel exclusion Zone designated as a public bathing Beach restricted to manually propelled vessels only providing for the installation of regulatory markers establishing violations relating to the public bathing Beach establishing the means of enforcement providing for the incorporation of recitals providing administrative direction to implement this ordinance providing for severability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading ordinance number 22-04 by title only I spoke with the manager refler I'd take lead on just presenting the Staffing on this hopefully this ordinance should not come as a surprise to any of you this is the product of a series of attempts at other at other drafts that did not best serve this community's needs and desires that is the legislative process and totally fine we also had a workshop on this on this issue and specifically with this draft in mind to discuss it where this body considered alternative options what this does is it conforms the city's code to the modern state of the law on vessel exclusion zones and the city is given the leeway under Florida law and Florida administrative code to establish vessel exclusion zones one of the categories that the city can establish is a public bathing Beach and we have elected to establish a public bathing Beach as a community the term public bathing Beach is not specifically defined in Florida statute or the Florida Administrative Code though many other forms of vessel exclusion zones are that leaves that that leaves that matter in our home rule powers to Define as appropriate and in Conformity with the other Administrative Code provisions and that's what we've done here so the proposed the Gulf of Mexico safety zone as you know it or to some the existing area within the buoys as we've known those buoys in this community would now be a public bathing Beach where you are allowed to operate manually powered vessels so if you have a sale if the sale is down and hopefully if possible the runners up you and you're manually operating it you can come in uh paddle boards kayaks canoes all manually powered all permissible within this Zone this does not allow for um excuse me this does not allow for combustible engines to come in even if briefly um as that or under a low wake that is not a term a approach that we could countenance while in keeping an harmony with the existing definitions in the code of the statute so this truck this is an ordinance attempting to reconcile the Equitable interest of this community as articulated by the commission or the council rather that balancing the interests of your recreating public with your Beach going public and and public bathers and children and all the things that have been raised in the various hearings ultimately this is an ordinance which makes it a policy decision all policies money policies are founded by some legal requirements But ultimately this is your your decision to make as this account thank you Mr Morrow before we have discussions on this I'm going to need a motion to approve I'd like to make solution to approve check mike Segel and Frank Baker uh Mike say what you had before uh We've obviously discussed it thoroughly and that also you're not allowed to use a sale sale or a kite sale without a high-speed applications um just wanted it comes down to really one thing look not everyone's going to be very happy about it but this protects everyone thank you other comments Frank Baker I believe this ordinance action replies with uh section 30-144 Section 3 motorized watercraft's not allowed to be in the beach areas at the Bel Air Beach and that's been on the boats for 20 some years and I've always held this one back because anyone knows me uh I've been fighting about buoys from Bel Air Shores up not Bellar Beach but um okay it was it's incomical sometimes to find out that you know people wanted to Anchor the boats and the Niger in their boats but it was completely prohibited for 20 years so okay I'm glad to see the food we should stay thank you Mr Baker anyone else Floyd Roberts I did have one question Mr Moore under definitions so number three I just want to get a visual in my own mind where he talks about vessels equipment sales or mechanical means of propulsion they enter the marked area only if the sales and mechanical needs to propose and it's not used mechanical mean what are we trying to convey here I just want to make sure we're clear on that mechanical meaning what because later on it talks about here it says and if possible to do so the mechanical means of promotion is tilted or raised out of the water so we would be giving those their ordinary meeting their ordinary meaning mechanical typically implies in an artificial mechanism powering it not not simply a pedal connected to a Spoke that's not mechanical means as this is constructed in context okay what you'd be talking about is the engine or a the sailed down the engine up you know in in some especially in little Skiffs and things as you get in the shower or water you can tilt that up so it doesn't scrape the bottom here and things of the like and so that's what it is referring to the mechanical needs to be the combustible engine the um that sort of uh construct okay so I just wanted to clear up that's what I thought so if somebody did have a combustible engine but they were outside our buoys and they said okay I'm going to shut it off I'm going to shut a paddle into Shore that's permissible so we under this because the mechanical means are no longer in case you're in use then there are functional from from a velocity standpoint which is one of the concerns um that we were trying to harmonize from a velocity standpoint at that point they are though they are maybe larger in Mass you can't paddle a 28 foot yacht nor can you gets it shorter um at that depth but your your velocity is indistinguishable from a paddle board okay got it thank you other questions if you're more I'd like to thank you first off for taking the time to tolerate us throughout this painful topic um it's uh it's you definitely have more patience than most of us well I I want to I want to take the time to commend this body I I want I I think it's important to recognize that frustrating though it may have been this is how the legislative process is supposed to work and I think ultimately over the course of our three and four drafts we got to a better word product and and that's the goal the goal is ultimately to balance the interest and get a better work product so often and forgive me but I'm going to take the option the opportunity to use the soapbox so often that division that we're seeing that we saw in this process is characterized as um you know stalemate and this person's in intransigent we can't get anywhere nobody's getting anything done this is the process it's very frustrating inherently our Democratic process is frustrating and it is slow and it is inefficient um perhaps lower than the books that will be allowed in but it is the process is it's designed with that in mind and I want to thank you for your patience with me as we worked through that product as I got to that understanding I do I do know um as between the workshop and now and on this first draft there may be one slight difference in the second reading harmonizing some of the elements that member Notaro raised before on the prohibited activities being specifically called out and ensured that those are harmonized with this draft and we don't leave anything lingering or at least stating any anything that is in conflict is is superseded I meant to address that between publication to you and I did not that will be addressed and has noticed to the public that will be addressed more light most likely in your second draft unless we decide that we just want to do that bicep and I don't know the council member the Tariff for calling into verification um let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to make a comment on this topic oh all right back to the council and we will give my example the final word yeah he's definitely Improvement here is taking a long process but I also want to commence more audience also been a very good chance for us to work together and learn our working Styles he said as we start a job it's difficult you don't know how people will work how they will react and it's really proven that this new city council really does work quite well together including you know with the interim city manager and the City attorney so closing I recommend uh you know bodies go forward with this thank you very much all right um so now we're going to take a vote and this is to approve the first rating of ordinance 2204 Ms Gentry would you please call away council member Banker yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts council member Shirley aye council members Abel I vice mayor Gunn aye mayor goddess aye so it passes unanimously we will do this what all right we are on to number 16. consideration of resolution 20 20-07 Mr Moore would you please read the summary after Mr Mayor of resolution 22 2022-07 a resolution of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida ratifying the state of local emergency in Bellaire Beach declared by the mayor due to tropical depression nine tropical storm and hurricane Ian and its potential threat of farm to the residents and property of the city of Beller Beach and providing for an effective date and termination date this has been a a first reading of resolution 2022-07 person only reading there thank you do I have a motion to approve resolution 2022-07 hello motion Loop made by Jody Shirley and I believe Frank Baker uh all right pretty surely you have these four Seasons [Music] the resolution from the hurricane hey any other comments from the council all right let's go to the citizens on this any comments yes dominant John hansey 22nd Street first off once again please Mr Mayor City Council Members with the microphones in front of their faces when they speak there are two of them I could hardly here thank you on the resolution I don't believe I have heard anything from the state that Governor DeSantis has terminated state of local emergency so my question would be um do you do you as mayor have discretion to terminated prior to his declaration or does that work I would normally we don't respond to questions but I will on this one I would like Mr Moore to address this question yes and the question is well placed and and I can you know I I first want to begin by stating um this this resolution in no way suggests that the events to the the south of this County are somehow you know fake news are unreal and nor are you suggesting that my folks are in Cape Coral and I'm very much aware of what that looks like this is uh Falls within our home rule powers to recognize that it would likely be insincere to suggest we're making emergency purchases at this time because we don't have the means time or resources to go through the ordinary channels and so through our home rule Powers we can recognize we don't have that need any longer though that need May otherwise exist in the state and so for purposes of this declaration is recognizing that for we are return to business as usual and we are not going to invoke emergency powers in good faith we are prepared to determinate thank you sir thank you Mr Andrew any other questions or comments from the citizens nope all right let's bring it back to the council with councilman council member all right so let's take a vote I think we could just do this on The Voice vote this is to approve resolution 2022-06 all in favor aye any opposed mayor um could we do a roll call on this please we sure okay thank you ready okay so please stay from council member Baker yes councilmember Notaro council member Roberts aye council member Shirley aye council members able aye vice mayor Gunn aye mayor Gaddis hi and surprisingly we come up with a second answer all right uh resolution 2022-07 passes thank you all right on to item number 17. this is for consideration of resolution 2022-08 Mr Mora your uh thank you Mr Mayor this is resolution 2022-08 a resolution of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach delegating to the city manager the administrative authority to authorize the use of the city seal under certain conditions making related findings providing for severability and providing for an effective date this is a first and single reading of resolution 2022-0 Wave by title only do I have a motion to approve resolution 2022-08 listening tomorrow and anyone else for a second second Judy Shirley Leslie you had before other comments from the council um I've uh just wanted to make it clear why you're wanting to have this authorization cool so uh I had a conversation with attorney more of a situation where clearly we need to approve the use of the seal obviously in a positive way for the city and I asked them what the procedure would be to do so and then he presented another it was actually a county resolution as an example of it it's done and I thought that you know given the guidelines it was it was something didn't happen in place to help with a procedural things that may be in the way the process of using the city seal I understand and was there something that came up where there's an immediate name for that uh in consideration for the Community Foundation programs okay I I just wanted everyone to hear it or any other comments from the council he said CEO of registered trademark foreign has done trademark and and intellectual property registration of city um intellectual property I coming into this I haven't been asked that question yet we can certainly look into whether it is and if we desire to do that I will tell you that in some communities first and foremost putting aside uh Federal copyright law it is a it is a crime of the State of Florida to use a city seal without authorization which is the the Genesis of this resolution to ensure there's no misunderstanding and to make very clear the conditions under which the the manager would rescind that the way this dialogue actually started interview manager reefler approached me with the idea of extending this to the city sealer logo and as we had that discussion we realized there is no logo to the extent some or know nothing beyond the city's seal there's the term is sort of used interchangeably and we don't want to dilute its protection by characterizing it as a logo but in communities like and just as an example the city of Dunedin where they have the official seal and then they have that sort of primary colors labeled Dunedin that they use as a logo those are registered and if we want to go to Alternative designs that may have an extended use where we say we're good with the local being used but not the seal and sort of tier war or Brands those is that is an option for us and we can look into that at this stage I'm not and it seems manager replay is not aware whether this is registered but I do think it's worthwhile to make all that known to answer that question I was just wondering if it's not registered is the resolution ballot it that's several quarters yes it is it is valid it is this is this is legally customary and again within our powers to to do that both based on your you have Mike's actually I understand all that but we wouldn't with a federal judge afford it's a license so you know a federal judge ultimately it's our intellectual property whether it's registered or not it's still copyrighted if I draw a picture here that's not Mickey Mouse but is some random creation it actually is entitled to copyright protections right there it's just an unregistered copyright you may have diluted protections uh this as a city seal and an official legal document what we would be granting is a revocable license so the legal framework for that exists I was going to say this whole thing resurrects some painful memories in the city of River Beach when years ago people tried to use this symbol behind us for not for fiduciary being or anything like that but just to say Hey you know these things are going on in the city of Village Beach so you know it was debate logo seal whatever the thing that came out is that is not symbol that appears in our city is sealed we stamp a document from the stainless steel that's not the symbol of thought so I'm saying I guess we need to really get our arms around this thing because you know we just kind of reinvent this thing every 45 years and maybe it's time according to your code of ordinances this is in fact your official City seal um and the resolution of Flagstaff um that citation if it is not your city seal that is you know I'm I'm going based on the legal documents I have access to um if there's in that meet whether or not that logo is used on what the clerk uses as a stamp may be something else and that can be looked into whether those can be harmonized but according to your code of ordinances is that specific depiction appears and is officially designated as the city well that's their ordinance was a result of this whole piece of the problem and I'm not quite sure it was given us all of the to do things he said yeah no I appreciate she just basically kind of went down the road to to basically draw upon the position of the City attorney understood well maybe we really need to look at it Mr Jones actually educating me now would it be better to table this and great because I didn't know there was two you just you just educated me this is a resolution and ordinance so we're not changing an ordinance authorizing you are authorizing the authorization here is specific in its scope you can just I'm not I'm not suggesting to you what you should do ultimately that's your decision as a body you've got the ability to table a resolution in the same manner you have an ordinance because it's still a policy document of the body if you are not comfortable with this content you have that ability again I I was aware that that ordinance was passed and I believe it's 2018 and so that would comport with what you're describing them a few years ago this was a topic of discussion um and so if there is if there are miss going misgivings misunderstandings or we feel due diligence needs to be done we can address that if this this specifically as written the resolution specifically identifies this document as the sealant and or this image as the seal and the image that a revocable license could be granted for if that's not the image that that this body recognizes as a seal that would be information to me that would be relevant vice mayor Gunn and then I will put this issue we've been for a long time let's get it done I uh I moved the motion I'm Global shamed every table this until we can provide them for these movies nutrition I think I have a motion to table on the consideration of resolution 2022-08 [Music] right council member Banker yes table council member Notaro councilmember Roberts no council member Shirley yes Caitlyn council members Abel no vice mayor Gunn I mayor gallis no so the motion table failed we need to move forward voting for this resolution however we have not yet taken any comments from his citizens would anyone like to speak on this topic nope all right back to the council and the pledge can I say something I would say that with this moving forward we need to have a plan making opportunity because it has been an issue that's really tense a few times and it was ugly to the point that Council was going to prosecute one of our citizens for innocently placing this on a piece of communication that they generated so it's a it's can lead to Serious ramifications and I do understand that my reasoning for moving forward and all this is because we still have the the community right so we need to we need to give them something to work with and in the meantime we should start working towards correcting this problem so we're back to uh taking a vote on this we're going to have to take a roll call from it council member Banker no council member Notaro councilmember Roberts yes council member Shirley no council members Abel yes vice mayor Gunn aye mayor goddess hi so the resolution passes five to two we will revisit this in the near future foreign positions before we get started do I have a motion to nominate and elect a new vice mayor motion made by vice mayor do I have a second second all right so he surely has the second so far the council members who have expressed interest are Leslie metaro Jody Shirley and Mike Sable since the motion was made by vice mayor Gunn I'll give you the usually our first nomination this Council membership is comprised of people bringing the contributes to the accounts among those things or long-term residents is seeing the good side of Miller Beach you've seen the bad side the evolution of Bel-Air Beach they're people with the tremendous business Acumen you have a lot of expertise and the codes and in contract and they bring a lot of different aspects to the business side by the city people bring assertive this to this job and they they've stepped forward they take a leadership role in the thing and get things done people bringing corporate history to this job what things are we Reinventing here what have we tried before that didn't work what have you tried before at works and rather than waste time reinvent a wheel that's continue to move forward on this thing most importantly voting on and doing what's best for the residents in the city of Bel-Air Beach there's only one person that comes to my mind that has all of these attributes long-term residents they've seen the evolution of Miller Beach good and bad tremendous business Acumen and contract and cruise has sort of has taken a leadership role and most importantly the corporate history so we just talked about some of these things with the use of the city logo or seal or whatever we're going to call it but most of all this person always always votes their mind on what's best for the residents and what's best for the city of Miller Beach personal agendas aside ours don't feel into science what is best for the residents and the City of Miller Beach that person is purely surely surely in person I nominate because that person because of all those attributes in one person should be sitting front and center on this dance alongside the mayor in helping shape where this community goes so we'll find endorsement and nomination is for German Sherman thank you thank you Mr Gunn I will now take other nominations kind of hard to follow that oh now I made myself all right my table any other nominations thank you very much any other nominations right I know that uh we just heard from Leslie that I would like to actually hear from each candidates like to speak and address the Council of those citizens is here now Joey Shirley well I've been a resident of Bellaire Beach since 2000 I have a lot of history here I had a lot of history here I've seen um many councils come and go I understand why we have in place some of the things we have in place I am I consistently move forward on new ideas and new projects and stay stay consistent with keeping our infrastructure top on the list and not getting cotton leaves a lot of these small items that that will affect citizens but in the end if we don't have infrastructure in a good running management team none of those other items matter um I would love to work out the rest of the term as a as the vice mayor but whatever you will decide who's best I'm fine with and will support our team however I use it thank you Miss Shirley now let's go to my exam second nominee yeah first and foremost I've attended every meeting here actually early and uh in person they feel that's critical you really have to be here to work and uh most notably by you know leading from the front within the community I mean you saw the last few days you know out there sandbagging uh having to be something out there personally but you know amongst all is I've reach out to the community like I said I got twice the number of people on my email list I reach out to regularly and I don't think anybody on the board actually any other council members reached out to that many with hurricane Preps uh with keeping them in part of what's going on with the city I mean you'll look further there's actually 35 items I'm proposing to get done that will save the city uh you know considerable money and uh no other candidate has done that I mean don't get it frankly it's like look if you're a previous council member of your previous mayor you failed to do it that time why should we elect you this time okay that's all I got thank you thank you very much Mr zagel Mr Tara please turn your microphone on okay um it's been a full-time resident here since 2002 moved on the beach originally got involved on the beach remourishment when we first moved here I got a small hammerhead shark standing on my Seawall which is not a good thing but worked with the state and with the county to get that done we have worked with many many of the people here in the town and Beller Beach is a unique community it's hard and hard to describe to people that you know we're residential we don't have any bars here or anything like that but I think it's important that we maintain that Ambiance that sense of community that we have here and I would like to continue doing that in the position of vice mayor thank you with any other council members like to make a comment all right let's go to the citizens with medium the citizens like to comment on these three candidates yes sir John Hanson John music 22nd Street first up let me say I'm not biased because we both served in the Navy however the fact that since councilman zabel has come on to this commission whose Council and even the hurricane he had led from the phone you got some excellent ideas I've read his emails that's the man that should be the vice mayor and I just have to say again even though I did it in private Bravo Zoo look at them that's the man that should be vice mayor thank you can hear the comments from the citizens yes sir hi Kelly I've worked with Jody Leslie for 20 years each one of them have done an outstanding job I don't doubt that Mike will do a terrific job now in the future um I think this is your decision Council we're not voting you are you've got great candidates and each one of you has to vote in your heart so whoever you think you should support you should I'll never forget the phone call from a stranger named Jody Shirley who called me one days when I was mayor and said I don't know you and you must be doing a hell of a job because the guy in the newspaper really hates you if there's anything I can do let me know and she and her children walk the street for me at re-election time so I endorsed Jody I love you Leslie but it's your vote Council thank you thank you any other citizen comments yes sir again my name is Randy lettuce um longevity in office uh to me doesn't mean much I mean you could look at the current president who's involved in politics for 40 years and doesn't impress me but I just want to say I keep going back to the proactiveness that might say it takes each and every day I see emails or notices or updates on the storm and everything else and in the last 14 years or whatever that I've lived here I've never got any reaction from any people I've ever sat on this body like this and this guy just he seems energized it seems like he wants to do so much for the community so I would urge you to give him the knot thank you thank you anyone else right so we're back to the council my care from hou uh they would like to give a final comment Frank Banker for coming else Mr Roberts my table nothing else vice mayor Dunn all right let's take it to a vote uh you have a ballot he said you have a ballot already there are two there are two uh two blames one of them is name and the other one is signature please write in your choice for candidate under name and then Hunter signature just sign it [Applause] all right council member Banker voted for council member Notaro council member Notaro voted for council member Notaro council member Roberts voted for council member Shirley council member Shirley voted for council member Shirley council members Abel voted for Council Members Abel vice mayor Gunn voted for council member Shirley and mayor Gaddis voted for council member Shirley thank you Patty so we have uh Jody Shirley four like Sable one Leslie Notaro two congratulations Joey Shirley you are now the vice [Applause] um [Applause] all right um now we are on to item number 19. consideration of appointment with Park and Recreation board alternate member to regular member this was supposed to be there were a cosmo however Patty informed me that Mr Cosimo has decided to remain as an alternate member therefore I am requesting that we would hold any motions on okay all right now we are up to number 20. this is for consideration of an agreement between the Bel Air Beach Community Foundation and the City of Baylor beach boarding great great program this was added to the agenda by interim city manager reefer before we begin discussion do I have a motion to approve D that would be Leslie matero hang will have a second that was Jody Shirley all right um I'm going to give this over to Mr Rachel and let him explain what we're trying to do here and thank you mayor so um just to start out because this is the first agenda item s i I started when I said the Strategic plan um as we brought up in the last meeting and I feel this one falls under the Aesthetics in the community as a goal [Music] can I get you to speak up a little bit sorry I'm getting some feedback on this like okay there's a little better um so uh what I was trying to say is yeah as far as lying this uh this item up with the Strategic plan I believe this represents gold uh Aesthetics and community um and uh what this is is it's an agreement works on the attorney Mora for the the other Community Foundation would be a great great program this agreements some key points of it I'm actually let me just give a little history of the dollar Beach Community Foundation that was it's a newly foreign public charity I did include their mission their mission is the BBC has mission is to foster a healthy beautiful and thriving environment through good works Community Improvement projects and social Gatherings to enhance the lives of the residents some background we brought this up in our Park certified Recreation Advisory Board they like in Ikea gotta run it by them we came up with a two possible locations for this which I'll get to later but I included as attachments so the agreement itself is um it uh it places the BBC up in uh in charge of selling or receiving funds produce break tax maintaining records of funds and maintenance of the brakes so the bbcf will manage every aspect of these great great program with the exception of the initial installation of the brakes that would be the city of Bellar Beach responsibility one other point is that the city is agreeing to install the brakes on at a minimum of six breaks and not the bbcf will not request the city to install the brakes more than one time per six months they also included the ABC after Gradebook program over a form as well as the suggested locations at the Park and Recreation board have came up with the key element to these locations are visibility and feeling the city of property was one of the most visible properties you can see thank you very much Council this question maybe for Mr Mora he Foundation she's also chairman of the parks and rec board does that cause any issues the question that you're asking is a dual office holding I can't tell if it's Dual office holding or if it's an Ethics question in as much as the as I understand DCF is an entity entirely separate and distinct from the city so you don't have a dual office holding element because it's not public office in as much as your question is a member of the parks and rec board is a member of the um is a member of the foundation this non-profit organization I'd have to know more about what their salary is and how that's remunerated but it as I understood to the extent this question had been raised in the broadest terms possible this is an independent non-profit entity looking to partner with the city this that Parks and Rec director doesn't have the ability to independently direct the city's funds or resources that's done by the council so that's not that's not really a power I don't see an issue as it's presented based on the facts I know thank you other questions or comments Frank Baker um under the reach out to establishing a great Brit program to recognize and honor persons organizations events related to the city of Delaware Beach and it's just something more like you came around to a museum what way you go in there and that's anywhere from people's names to your events that happen botanical gardens has the same brick wall there's a lot or it's just going to be like you have to have you have to do something for the city or recognize the cities as marriage or something like that or who they who's going to pay for these bricks is what I'm saying who's going to say this is a lot of not allowed so the people who fill out the application they're paying for the brakes right and it's a form of raising money for the foundation to in turn positively affect the city and then the determination is the uh dollar based Community Foundation they will um I believe we put in here it's something about the positive foreign I'll give you an example I want to buy it for a God bless dollars are we not allowed to use the word god well clearly says they're not going to discriminate and that the only exception is is if you've been convicted of a felony anymore okay I'm just I'm just trying to get some clarity because I have artworks down in uh Irv INE I believe it's the same Foundation that authorizes it is not the same Foundation as much as the belar Community Foundation is not partner Ed with that City to my knowledge it may be a similar model I'm not familiar with how that program specifically operates I would tell you as a release of the agreement that is before you the way it's drafted is the initial it there is a section called Break text exclusions which member Shirley called out but the way it's written pecf has initial editor's license if you will if somebody says I don't think bbcf has made the right decision here or I should be allowed notwithstanding bbcs position that does provide a dispute mechanism where they could appeal a decision to bbcf and bbcf representatives would meet with the city to review the original request and render a final decision on the appeal which would be forwarded to the donor so there is an element where if somebody says I want this and bbcf says no um I'm sorry Bellar Beach Community Foundation and they say no that person has an opportunity to say hey I want the city to weigh in on this as part of the process that's how it's designed so we don't have to pay for the appeal or anything like that the city or anything that sounds like it would be much more of an administrative hearing that the manager perhaps sitting with a designated representative of BBC FSA explain it to me let's go through there's nothing in here that contemplates a quasi-judicial hearing before a city body it's not a city program the city's just making its resources available to enhance the beautification and Aesthetics but it's preserving a right to participate in the process so that and that and that is a sort of a contemplated check and balance if they are being arbitrary capricious and aren't actually discriminating oh well it says this and we just don't like that they're going to have and that person says I still want this the city's going to have an opportunity to say no you can't do that all right thank you other questions or comments from the council Julie Roberts uh Kyle so do you need a decision or do we even get involved in which of the two placement options or is that something you guys are just going to handle you wanted to get an idea from you know what what you thought was a better location okay for the bricks that's why I included those if you want that day and night uh yeah okay if you guys feel one way or the other if you're interested you know and ultimately what what manager reefler is looking for is authorization enter into the agreement sure so as we look at this having listened to the dialogue if we need to make changes in that appeal language may be one that we revisit to make a little more specific how that's resolved um we can do that so they'd be seeking authorization to move forward with the agreement in substantially the same form and perhaps that that design choice that you just raised so if it is if we do approve this I think it's a good good program a choice of those two options and I did a 10 I think one or both of those but my personal preference is the actual sidewalk we did talk about you know if we wanted to go ahead you could actually remove one of the rectangular portions of the sidewalks there things potentially fill them in with on scribe bricks and then as people buy you know you know we can take that out and then place it in there we would always have that one rectangular section number of bricks in our possession and we could move forward like that and think with people when you walk over it you know people you actually see it better than on the perimeter of the sidewalk that's just my personal opinion other questions or comments for you know let's uh go to the citizens right quick concerning the Miller Beach Community Foundation and the agreement Place breaks all right we're back to the council and isn't it there you have the final words so um this is to approve the agreement between the Baylor Beach Community Foundation and the City of Delray beach boarding a great great program I was originally just going to do a voice boot Patty are you satisfied with that yes okay all in favor aye aye any opposed all right the agreement passes Mr reefer you are all for us to receive D and we are on to agenda item number 21. for authorization to approve uh proposed a proposal for plan review services interim city manager reebler this is a request authorizations to contract with Madrid cpwg services to review new building plans for plans for clients with seating codes before we get started do I have a motion are we surely do I have a second Floyd Roberts all right vice mayor Shirley you had before yeah this this area we have a reliable engineering firm to review if you go to any municipality they give you a time frame of which your plans will be reviewed and as we stand right now we can't do that so Kyle needs some support from a reliable firm and I think foreign yeah I had a discussion with Kyle earlier about this this is the corporate memory thing we dealt with this organization during the underground in Project we want to current environment otherwise I agree with the vice capability contract around time frames and necessary for example thank you Mike Sable well this is a sole source I mean I don't say any other firms being considered evaluated a little bit of History this came from the rmq in 2019 after receiving eight submittals for that we decided on the top five that we signed agreements with the agreements were pretty provided for miscellaneous services and plan review from that point this former city management then reason I ranked those firms we found that largely with ESG was the best choice given this history as flat rates in their angle you had to bring to the table um Larry worked all of us for a couple years after that I think I wrote here an unforeseen circumstance he was no longer able to work with us so at that point we moved to dual Associates who was a firm that's been in this area for some time and they accepted doing the plan review for an hourly rate um and then since then you know they've been purchased by Stephanie engineering and uh from in my working with them it's been taking a little bit longer you have plans turned around for review my my intent of this approval this proposal is just to reach out to another firm that was on that RFQ and provide another option that we didn't use but after having a discussion with the former vice mayor Gunn I think that the best the best interest of the city it's about time that we went out for another RFQ um at that point we formalize more detailed agreements with expectations as far as timelines for the plan review oh absolutely it should have went after the RFP rather than go into this because it seems like there's no due diligence going into this person yes very big yes it is 2019 based on whatever information was back there here we are asking to sign off because like trust has got me I don't know what's happening I guess this is uh when you would say a temporary candidate to try to get things going on quicker in the interim yeah when we shoot it right the first time other comments that's the terrible what one minor comment on the agreement on page [Music] um creative service 3.1 probably after recipes of a fully spoon executed copy I think spell check history has been received which section was that a period of service it's the agreement from September um found this before so um I guess my concern is in trying to find a solution when we begin to move engineering firm there's a frustration with the turnaround of the site plan review um share in full grades to continue doing it but I did have a conversation with him today about opening up another option and they were on board with that date um the main engineer that I work with Al um you know carrier he uh he said that they did something similar in Treasure Island catch up so I do what RFQ is is necessarily the situation I'm for the for the time period I'm just trying to move things through a little frustrating the contractors and I have not or I have actually hurt complaints about the time and so uh process um I do agree that we need to do a formal RIT however I have no problem authorizing this as a temporary solution to help you in this in this time of crisis any other comments from the council yes I'll sign out of a temporary status that if we put a Time framework [Music] we have full concurrence with that you know right behind checks here you know timeline no we're going to stop that there must be a timeline exactly I agree we need something here to stop getting better but so let's just put in time frame rate number four if I may um I would that that feedback is well taken I think what what might be the better way is prioritizing the RFQ process rather than putting a expiration date on having additional resources this is sort of the to to try to Reason by analogy a lot this is sort of buying a second wrench to keep in the toolbox and you can use either one I wouldn't advise that you handicapped Yourself by saying well we're only going to go back to that one wrench that's kind of working for us by date certain if for example we're really working on our riq process and we're trying to fine-tune those terms and now we've got oh this is coming to an expiration date I think that becomes a better reflection of how you folks prioritize your workflow going forward on this and and holding the manager and administration accountable where are we on getting that RFQ out ultimately again that's your decision but I would suggest rather than limit the number of resources in their availability to you that that would be limited better by your next action rather than this action the issues you're going to run into though is your acute process as a project timeline of its own so you've got to put one together it's got to go through your process it's got to be advertised you got to review it for that so I mean which is why I'm saying we should you shouldn't say like oh we're going to do this for 90 days and then find the Dr Q process takes you 120 and now you're back to only one resource for those last 30 days yeah so so the RFQ process can give us a timeline right this is exactly that process okay now okay I'm going to say precisely yes sir so how long would we need for an RFQ process to run 90 days for the RFQ process I'd say 90 days is very a couple of days crafting writing yeah yeah 90 days 90 days my table um okay but that's uh that's not on this so this is something we would just have to raise a consensus on network and actually I prefer not to go forward on this I'm making a motion to table this second we have a motion the table so let's take a look you know at least we do a motion to table all discussion stops okay council member sorry council member Bangert council member Gunn all right councilmember Notaro no to table council member Roberts no council members Abel yes the table vice mayor Shirley no mayor goddess no I said the motion table fails we've had our discussion anything else before I go to the citizens on this citizens all right we are back to the council uh last word yes so I'd like to amend this thing until you can put a 90-day time on it on the authorization or this temporary built ending RFQ for a full-time I'm hearing a motion to amend a second and second so now this is for authorization to approve proposal for plan review services with a time limit of 90 uh let's see I guess we need to go back to the citizen panel just just to clarify what I was saying in the 90 day time period was I was agreeing to uh the RFQ and receiving results from that and then uh scoring and qualifying those firms um after that a uh agreements would be interrupted um I would request a little more time to to get the correct agreements in place and uh and get the firm signing off on it we currently have a motion on the table to abandoned in 90 days you'd like to retract that function s move forward I think it's in the services agreement there's a termination um convenience and if either Partners can be terminated on 30 days notice so I don't think we need to put say it's only good for 90 days you know it's covered I think what what Mr Gunn is trying to do is trying to make sure that we actually do what we say we're going to do now that being said we can always do we can always do another and another agenda item another resolution before the next meeting or we can just go ahead and commit to with I'll always take women to put 800 102 days 120 day time limit on this temporary cpwg motion makers amending the is electing to amend the motion from a motion to amend ment to motion to amend for seconds for 120 day limitation I believe it was November I forget who it was I think it was no Banker who seconded a member as the individual seconded or even minimal to that yeah okay the motion movement is amended substance it's 120 days okay so now we are working on authorization to approve a proposal for plan review services with a 120 day limit we have a motion and we have a second and now we're open for discussions yes sir I just want to confirmed file that you comfortable with 120 or would like another 180 maybe six months be a better time period is what makes you get comfortable with it if I prioritize it I can get it done at 120. okay other comments from the council let's go to the citizens back to the council vice mayor Dunn this is Stu this is for your uh no longer vice mayor oh I did again it's a hard habit to break all right uh well that's good all right so let's take a vote we're going to take a loop council member I'm sorry this is to authorize the approval I'm sorry authorization to approve proposal for plan review services with a limit of 120 days okay council member Baker yes council member Gunn I councilmember Notaro no council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley hi mayor goddess I I think I'd like to thank everyone

agenda by council members Abel before I call for a motion and would like to address Mr Sable on this just because there's several items in one single agenda item my recommendation is to either withdraw these this agenda items or have the council make no motion on it stance now I don't think every item will pass on a single boat however I do believe we can move forward on some of these just by General consensus in the next work session these are only my suggestions that the council prefers to move forward with this now we can proceed so do I have a motion to move forward with council member Sable's proposed communication procedures nope all right another merchandise and what I would recommend is that we bring this up did not move forward I recommend that in our next work session and Mr realclear if you'll go ahead and add it to the next agenda that bullet points and we discussed if you missed bear on that there's actually not just those bullet points it's actually 35 and we were attached so if we put those in the working session in fact I'd really prefer going through the working session there's a lot here that the council's never attempted before had a lot of work to do on that works for me and I appreciate all of your hard work and uh taking the time to put some sort of a directional list for us well yeah the idea is you don't come to you with a problem come with a solution all right now we are on to the added agenda item number 24 which is uh concerning the city manager search there's really nothing to vote on on this it's going to be a discussion item just to kind of roll this into an unfinished basis to brought forth by vice mayor Shirley and I will hand foreign with all respect to number surely if I may just by way of update at the last meeting I was tasked with reaching out to the FLC and its resources we played some phone tag in the lead up to Ian and had a communication breakdown as far as on my end as far as follow-up through Ian remember Shirley the student he followed up with me earlier today I spoke with the representative from the senior advisor program that is his current moniker if you've heard Road Rangers or Council advisors in the past the new brand the senior advisor but we're talking about that kind of thing there um I I've worked with their local representative Miss pambra Cacho um in other communities and I had a call with her this afternoon or late morning in speaking with her I explained the current state of the landscape that you've done a recruitment an extensive citizen input extensive review had a candidate it felt through she was tangentially aware of it she was also familiar and had worked with Mr Reeves in the past and I explained that interim manager reflear has been working in the position for a few months and while individual members might differ on what the best step is to go forward there was a general consensus to say let's take a beat reevaluate where we are see if perhaps the situation is working enough that we should meaningfully entertain it or provide memory ninja replay additional resources to ensure his success or that he has the resources to make that successive option for him if you will in speaking with the senior advisor I floated based on the general discussion that I'd heard at the last meeting the idea perhaps her sitting down with manager reefler getting acquainted personally sitting with a representative of the council maybe the mayor or I'm sure whomever you folks need appropriate to get to get sort of the the legislative um perspective on this the legislative Branch's perspective and just based on her experience coming to your next meeting which I believe is November 7th which works well with she's got an extensive travel schedule and she's already penciled in if the council so desires to attend the next meeting and based on efforts made in the next few weeks provide you some recommendations going forward whether that be here's what you can do through iccma and trainings and otherwise and and what that calendar of events look like whether it's I do think you may wish to go about a search and this is what that process could look like if you wish to work with senior advisor otherwise but giving you a read the the general I will tell you that the consensus in most leadership positions is if it ain't broke don't fix it and ultimately if it ain't broke as a determination for you folks to make I'm not pining on that by saying that but ultimately if manager refler is working out for you obviously destabilizing leadership is never preferable the one point that she and I did discuss was how the council would wish to to handle the fact that interminator reefler is holding multiple positions I'm sorry Kyle I know it's like sort of weird to talk to you about she has like a it's an identity when you were like holding hands here um but the um the herbal and her one point of insistence was if that is the direction both for the success of the community and the success of the candidate both parties are going to have to decide you know from from from men's reefler's desire if he's going to be made interim manager with a contract recognizing that he leaves behind the comfort of employment versus at will employment and Charter position and also just back whether or not there are means to backfill his position on an ongoing basis his past provision position um just recognizing you're going to have resource needs to make sure all means are met I'm not telling you anything that hasn't been said about four different ways over the course of this evening but that is where things stand so my my inquiry to you in as much as I was delegated or designated as a liaison for that resources would you like me to ask on behalf of the council for her to engage in that sort of process or some permutation error and I think that we're looking for direction and probably could use some some help so I'm only one person I'd like to hear what other council members have to say beginning with vice mayor Shirley stand this to the agenda yeah so um I reached out to our attorney Moore today regarding this issue knowing that we need to make some decisions I can tell you that um I think we asked Kyle how he was doing at one of our work sessions and he said he's hanging on and we've got to make some decisions one way or the other get some assistance in getting help he can't continue to work the way he is and we need to come up with a solution and a plan on how we're going to move forward can't be ignored we can't have a meeting go by without this being top of this discussion and having an outline and what whatever that looks like whether it's appointing someone on Council to spearheaded that something needs to happen and move forward thank you other comments from the council yes great thank you well a little over a week ago we were facing a cat tourcraft 3 hurricane this man's been our interim city manager now since June I think he's been Flawless uh I don't know what more this Council wants out as me he's doing three jobs sometimes um gave up his weekend and gave up his family the services City gave up his home to put to our city first what more do we want to add um I think we should go into contract talks right now with this man and he's the best candidate for this city he's dedicated he's a hard worker hey if we want to get him a little bit more education fine put it in a contract that he has to do something like that or whatever the fill these goals you know but let's let's stop this process I recommended him the second week of our third week of March it's now what seven months later that we still don't have an interim city manager it would have been a joke that if we would have paid 180 some thousand dollars for that other guy to come here he would have never fill one sandbag last week other comments I totally agree with what Frank just said I think we need to change our search to finding a public works director good evening Mr Roberts yeah I've had the opportunity to um to work with Kyle very closely in a couple of projects and meetings that we've had the most recent was when we went over code enforcement and I can tell you that the time that I've I've been here and got to know Kyle Moore and actually see his expertise and knowledge and how he deals with things I have moved the meter in my own mind with respect to is he the best candidate I currently feel he is and here's my personal feeling you know all the criteria that somebody's going to have is going to be our city manager from zero the score of one to ten I don't think anybody is going to be a 10 in all the categories I'm confident there's several criteria that Kyle because of his working knowledge of our city and the time that he's been here he's going to be pretty much anybody on those type of categories that we're going to bring in from the outside it's just logical that's the way it's going to be there's probably some other things that Kyle may not you know meet the standard of some other people that we might bring in and some other categories but I think any of those categories Kyle like any of us would do better I think back in my career and I was put in high leadership positions and I guarantee you when I got that opportunity went home that night didn't sleep very well because I knew there were some things I needed to be better at and as my time in those positions I grew in those opportunities just like any of us would do and will do so I'm confident now having the additional time with Kyle and seeing him work and understand things that he has my support thank you Mr Roberts Mr Gunn I'm on board with everything that's been said I'll ask a couple questions here because my observations are kind of in the job and when it comes to motivation and dedication we're not going to find that the differences in what we would have paid some of the other high-powered people we can buy or Outsource expertise we might fall short on I would like to continue to see Kyle self-developed start positioning himself for maybe his own future higher responsibility or something like that in the interim I think he's he's our guy and uh I just need to make sure that Kyle's comfortable with that because you're going to sign up for it serve at the pleasure of the council the backfield behind you and that may have some repercussions but you have my trusted confidence I think you can do it and the question is is do you share that opinion um yeah to answer your question again when I when I first applied for this position I uh it was a responsibility and a risk that I accepted and I believe that's the uh the step into taking a position of leadership um you know we work for seven different council members it's just it's a lot of work it's a constantly adjusting and improving yourself and it's what I wanted so you have the answers yes you know we've had a great observation period high-end High Tempo lops surge operations whatever you want he's measured it up really well so I'm all for making an affirming position in fact filling and giving the resources he needs to do his job broken and thank you Mike saber yeah I like to make a motion that we direct attorney Mora to draft a contract for Mr calorie for both him from interim to full time and enter negotiations second okay um you're making a motion to draft a contract to move forward with Kyle as these days absolutely everything I've seen so far worked with them side by side uh he's got it with our support he can succeed we do have backups we have professional people that can enter into this to work with them we cannot move forward on his previous position until we lock him down to this one once we lock him down to this one we sign contracts because of mutual terms at that point we open the search for his replacement but as far as time let's get moving on this we have a motion on a table would anyone like to comment if you haven't heard anything from vice mayor Sherwood yeah I mean I opened the conversation up um you know the the caveat was trying to get Kyle some help I knew agreeing he's probably would be great in the job I do feel strongly that a senior advisor coming on board to assist him to give him guided means to Mentor him would be in huge benefit I don't like to keep having these conversations that we can move forward with Kyle I don't know what that you know absolutely what that would look like but I do know that we need to um moving forward in some Manner and getting this off our plate so we're not revisiting it constantly and it's not being pushed under the rug so if it's moving forward with contracts that's I'm fine with that if everyone's in agreement I am open to suggestions that we don't have this conversation again and we and we have a commitment on how we're moving forward thank you I've wrestled with this for a while and as time goes on I've become more and more impressed with you Mr riefer I think you've uh you've stepped up to the plate you've done things that I thought for sure would be way out of your wheelhouse but you keep pleasantly surprisingly I was hoping we had a little more time but it looks like the will of the household is to move forward with this um before we take a vote on this motion I'm going to have to go to the citizens for Commons [Applause] anyone like to comment let's start with priority hi I'm Jeffrey Davis and your fire chief I'm not a resident of Bellar Beach but I wanted to share my experience with Kyle recently here in preparations with hurricane Ian and Kyle and I were in constant communication with each other in everything that we did with preparations and he actually even reached out to see if he could be at our Emergency Operations Center for the duration of the storm so that he could be here as close as possible to ballet race because he was pretty far away and normally we don't have um Community leaders in the Emergency Operations centers as we run an emergency and throughout and through the after effects but that was Kyle we made arrangements for him to do that thankfully and took a turn we you know pray for those who effective but that was Kyle's dedication to the city of Bellaire Beach and we made those arrangements for him and thankfully he didn't have to be there but he didn't above and beyond and I'm going to share one my last experience professional experience we had an interim city manager that did an outstanding job and everybody urged the council to hire that person and they decided to go with somebody who had more experience as a city manager and that person didn't last six months and now the person who they originally recommended is the city manager permanently just wanted to share my experience of what a professional call has been in representing your city and your students thank you for your time my team Davidson how did you know to be here tonight well I was actually here last Monday and I said where is everybody and it was on my calendar at the wrong time and so um you know I want to be at your meetings I was going to be here earlier I came in late but I had another meeting to be a I'm glad that I was able to be here and give him like my two cents there thank you for coming your comments they're greatly appreciated thank you John Andrew foreign for a very long time from the beginning I've been involved in it on a Citizens advisory committee I always in the top four or five recommendations from the CAC and unbeknownst to the committee you guys got to pick somebody that's fine I'm here to concur with everybody and State council member members Abel's motion it's a long overdue I remember sitting here going through listening to y'all at a work session and again the same council member made some suggestions recommendations that Kyle was agreeable to when he was finally a member of the conversation he also understood the consequences if he accepted and was hired on as city manager and if that filled with a public works director and I sat here and listened to everybody tonight let's go let's get a contract that's your man that's our brand thank you any other comments from the citizens all right we're back to the council with Mike Sable man in the last one oh I'm sorry oh yes Victor I'm sorry you're always over there hiding behind a camera um I've been working with the city for a long time since uh Nancy Gonzalez was a city manager and then um we had our former city manager and a Kyle was working closely with all the projects and he's done a fantastic job and as a contractor I've seen like no change in communication or everything's been presented very well from house also in support thank you thank you very much any other comments all right now we're back to the council with Mike today we'll have in the final word okay um yeah again it's been a long process we've been our due diligence uh Cal and I were very tight together in fact we're working on Park Mobile right now we probably stay at the city about 2000 a year which is kind of cool but uh he has my strongest recommendation in this one I want to move ahead vote on this work out a contract hopefully negotiate it to the satisfaction of both parties and move on thank you very much all right let's go to a vote this is very important so so uh Patty should do a role model council member bankard yes council member Gunn I proceed councilmember Notaro yes councilmember Roberts aye council members Abel yes proceeding vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess oh yeah so passes unanimously here I will provide I will prepare the draft for Mr leaflet review I'll say it in public venues and in addition is saying privately while you and I work together on a regular basis as I send you drafts you are free to have your own independent attorney review for your rights and interests I represent the city its Council in that process that there's a change that we're still you know cool um I just have to make that clear um and and so with that I will proceed obviously I have I'm not starting from scratch I'm also not going to be using all the same terms I'll take into account what this body has talked about remember Shirley to your point when you talk about the idea of living forward with Mr riesler is not in congruent with the idea of using and making resources available to him through that process and I can also look at metrics much in the same way that the previous contract had goals if this Council as we go through that drafting process has goals different from or in addition to or the same as what had been in that I believe it was exhibit B to that contract that you think should be specific to member refler please let me know we can take those into account sorry manager reflector and we'll we'll work forward with that but if if after a draft is initially circulated you folks feel we need a workshop or something else particularly that we can of course accommodate a program thank you Mr Mora and uh I'm assuming that once an agreement is reached then looking up to wait for two higher education is that correct at that stage you will be your chief administrative officer as he is now but with a very clear mandate that he is to fully occupy that office at that point in a manager form of government he will have all the powers to hire and fire as necessary which would include identifying his successor the only reason I'm speaking in those vague terms is he's going to have to decide what personnel needs he has as a manager and how to prioritize building those positions and I'm not going to dictate which position would be first or whatever thank you very much for that clarification all right so now we are on to agenda item 25 on finish business and we're actually doing pretty good we haven't finished business can I bring out something that needs to be considered soon um just a couple of questions I guess planning and telling who is our um this is our chair for the planning to zoning board does anyone know jcm film we just they never show up for the quarterly reports so we maybe need to consider making some changes back and forth we've done in the past of this may be a time we need to step in to make some changes because we do in 2023 we need to revisit our comprehensive plan and we need a team that's really going to be interested in doing so so just being proactive that's uh that's good advice and uh I concur can I answer that for actually talk to you train I mean this is not an unknown occurrence for the council the previous Council had problems when they dismissed the member of the committee can we just double check the attorney make sure that we're crossing all our keys and dying all our eyes on this case I wasn't fully following that conversation I understood it as we need to this needs to be something we talk about in the near term I didn't understand it as a boat to terminate a member's membership on the board in this moment if I misunderstood that please let me know if we were a Terminator member I'd like to talk about do process concerns and going through that for certain and ultimately the board designates its own chair and vice chair typically if the board is not satisfied with its chair it can deal with that and I think it'd be best to let them govern in that manner and if we feel that somebody is not fulfilling their obligations we can revisit that off that discussion I think it's prudent to raise the issue and say I'd like this on the radar as we have um we by way of example uh I told you earlier in the night that I'd be circulating sign code as I have a draft that's something that will go before you're planning and zoning board ultimately most likely I'm advised the manager of such so those sorts of things would come forward but I I would say appropriate to raise it as a concern I would not want to unceremoniously announce and make that decision this evening and I don't think that's what was being proposed my recommendation is always to reach out to the person that is I think we're having an issue with before it ever comes to that that level of social thank you any other unfinished business all right now we are on to council cop this month we're going to go in computer generated random order except now that we have a new vice mayor uh she must go so that being said council member Notaro you have the floor no comments council member Roberts congratulations Jody and Kyle I bet you didn't think tonight when you came to this meeting that this was going to happen congratulations to you that's interested yeah I think just one thing about Emergency Management um our city does not have an emergency management director nor should it we're not we're not big enough for that Pinellas County has a Emergency Management director and those are the people we as a city should be lying every time when we talk about information and videos that are available 100 guaranteed and I haven't even looked at it I guarantee you their website under Emergency Management would have all of that data and all of that information that we would ever need and that's the way it should be set up those people are full-time Emergency Management people every day of the year they have a large staff that's what they do you need to use them they're a tremendous resource just want to make sure that that's where we go we can't take on all of those responsibilities within our city we're not big enough we don't have the people or the Manpower or woman power to do that so use the resources use Pinellas County Emergency Management and we would be much better off for that guaranteed thank you Mr Roberts now we're about to council member gun the only thing I'd like to remember is that these issues that we're having a tough time deciding what the plural of the residents are or whatever maybe it's time to put some of the stuff on the ballot that adds a legitimacy to the whole thing people have similar to people just to suggest it could cost money but that's that's how you slice up the quality enough thank you I worked at council member Baker well I recommended Mr ridgler back in March of this year and my majority of council decided to go forward with the search okay further was the only one that voted for you Kyle the American Academy stand seven people after that city manager contract negotiations washed out which I don't know how much money was paid you Mr Moore more negotiations and everything like that two more times I recommend that my motion that we get to this contract and move forward because finally tonight the council stepped aside from the tree and saw the forest before he's done congratulations well deserved I think you've been insulting in the last seven months by this Council and I feel bad for you and your family but congratulations for tonight furthermore the city is Escape under God's will the category two or three hurricane I hope we've all gave thanks to them so member Baker and understanding you're making a rhetorical point I just want to make clear the tempting though it may have been all of the negotiations were within the retainer because I have joined the process in progress I did not think inappropriate to make it a special matter thank you we could use your services on other things council member Sable yeah congratulations to councilman Shirley I'm the actual election um I'm truly humbled by some assistance comments about me but we're all working to support the council as a whole and uh toward that I recommend Council we've never had a procedure like this before we're actually citizens Commons I mean I'm reaching out to 611 people out there and they're coming back with race suggestions that have never been marked down what I've done is taken everyone assign them a strategic plan and I'm going to place those in front of the council so he got time council members please look through those are basically about seven pages over 35 items that the citizens have felt strongly about and they deserve to know what we're doing about those status and how we're going to move on in the future but that's all I got thanks thank you Mr zoo and we are on to vice mayor show well I just want to thank everyone for supporting me um very humbled by it and I will continue to support the student citizens and you know Kyle I didn't open this meeting up tonight you know thinking that my change in the agenda would bring you to negotiating but I'm glad we're able to bring you health because you look tired and you look like you need help so I'm thankful for everything you've done and I'm happy that that's helped her about thank you I would like to thank all City staff members for their hard work of preparing the Storm of the Century I'd also like to thank council member Mike Sable and Frank Baker and others who assisted with sandbags it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day drama on next door and Facebook in the end we should realize that we are all neighbors and should treat each other as such our situation could have made a severe term for the worst thankfully if we were spared in our vehicle Community lives on I'd love to congratulate the interim city manager Reaper I hope that you're able to come to an agreement and serve as well I would also like to thank council member Gunn for his time as vice mayor and I would also like to congratulate vice mayor Shirley for stepping up assuming that position as always I'd like to thank everyone for coming tonight and to those who are attending at home with that being said do I have emotions second seconded by Leslie gutiero all in favor aye aye any opposed good night everyone"
