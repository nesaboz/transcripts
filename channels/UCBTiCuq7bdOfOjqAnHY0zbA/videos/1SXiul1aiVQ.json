events for 2021 this is the park and recreation board chair tammy lavender and we have three outdoor items jazz in the park family picnic uh the halloween doll costume parading contest the christmas tree lighting and holiday social and the christmas boat parade is someone here from the parks in brackerville yes first you know what before i do this let me get the motion first to uh to you know i gave it to you last time i'm going to give it to jody and marv so he makes the motion we'll defer our comments till after the uh after the presentation um okay so our group we got together and we just kind of brainstormed different ideas and these were the four that we kind of came up with that everyone liked and we just wanted to get your your input like if you had any other suggestions or if you would approve these so i'm just here for questions in regards to these events we kind of mapped out the dates we did a little bit of research but we thought we should get approval before we did too much into the detail of it are you asking for the formal approval of the events tonight with uh for us okay council questions yes i would like to go ahead and make a few um have you reached out to our citizens yet to get their feedback because that's always been very important and i've been consistent on asking that also do you plan on putting together a plan providing safety covered what we're going to call all kinds of different information we're going to need parking everything has any of that been thought out at this point are you going to go after a citizen's feedback first well as you know it's rather difficult right now to get the communications board is trying to get everybody's email my understanding is we're not allowed to send out an email blast we only maybe have 120 emails it's very expensive to do a mass mailing so we can't do it for everything so what we've done so far if you look under parks and rec on the bellar beach website it has my cell phone number and i'm asking for requests or suggestions because right now the only thing on there is a beach yoga class a boot camp class and then like we call it walk and wine but like we meet here and then we walk over to walk the bridge and then whatever so really at this point if anybody has a suggestion on how to reach out to the citizens we're not allowed to even we were actually going to go and just put flyers in everyone's mailbox you're not allowed it's illegal so any suggestion that anybody could give us to get this out so what our thoughts on this was because i don't think the date was read but for the jazz and the park family picnic through may um we would send out like a postcard and then we would put you know coming events and then put the other three maybe on the back as far as like details um we talked about it a little bit but until we got everything approved we really weren't going to put a whole lot of time into it if it was squash like we did some research on the entertainment as far as the covid absolutely it'll be more like a everyone would bring their own picnic basket and we would provide closed drinks and like sealed dessert bar so like cookies and cupcakes they're in containers kind of like they're doing everywhere right now because everybody the covid protocol should be pretty easy to find and follow right now because everyone is doing them so i don't think we're going to have to do a lot of research as far as that goes because the groundwork has pretty been pretty much laid out so we would try to work on getting rsvp and then like have people space out their picnic blankets or their chairs and and we would work out the details before i would say march or april at the latest did i get all your questions uh yes it does but i have a couple more where are you planning this event and is it going to be open to the general public or just baller beach residence well it would be here and it would be kind of set up like a wedding would be and absolutely no it would just be bellar beach residents and like i said we would try to get an rsvp to make sure like if we are providing non-alcoholic beverages and a dessert bar that we have enough for everyone that would be in attendance so no it would just be residents i don't know if if a family calls and says you know my cousin in town visiting i can't really say no but can people from feller shores or bellar bluffs come no i wouldn't think they'd want to come to her so now it would just be residents let me ask how would you ensure that well i don't think you can you can't police that you're not going to ask for id so i don't think that should happen if a family happens to come from bel air bluffs well then we'll just have to make room and be happy to love them yeah but not advertise for other cities to join us but not also check ids for citizens yeah i mean bellar beach family picnic it's pretty clear it's you know it's not a you know come on come all like everyone's welcome usually those events are pretty pretty advertised that direction so i would hope that we could make it pretty clear just in our invites and on the website in any other way and i'm hoping i don't know when the board up front is going to get up and going i know there's a lot of things in flex right now so some of the things we're going to have to work out as we get closer and those things are completed do you have budgets for any of this sure and my concern is this boat parade because i know there was research done by the past park board and um the first thing i caught my eye is that we're doing it the same day as indian rock speech and i think that in the past was a problem the captain who would be leading that parade didn't want it on the same day as indian rocks and indian rocks didn't want it the same day as us so i don't know if we're trying maybe something has changed maybe you know more than you can let you know tell us about but in the past trying to team up with indian rocks or trying to do a joint event wasn't going to happen and it was pretty expensive as i remember very expensive to hire that captain so i'm just wondering what we're what we're looking at over here in terms of dollars well we have our given budget as far as that goes that was just a suggestion from someone on the board like this is as much feedback as i've had on that and considering it's in december we have you know time to research it more i think her thought or and like just the consensus of the conversation was if it's not it's you know they always have it like what the saturday before christmas so you know if we have it two weeks out and we do it on our own like i'm pretty much the last house in bellar beach next to indian rocks and they literally turn around in front of my house we would be going the other direction as far as the costs on a captain when we we discussed the budget that we were given we kind of blocked it out like a third and then we knew the boat parade would be expensive so then a third and the other two are you know pretty much cost next to nothing so we are understanding unless a boat hampton is six thousand bucks for the night which i cannot imagine it what we would be able to like stay within our budget the um but a lot of details need to be worked out but you know it's january and until i knew we were going to get a yes you know it's it could be like where you are saying that like there's issues with legalities or we can't get someone or whatever then we would just find a different event the only other comment that i have well two things i agree with robin hockey um in terms of advertising the newspaper is going to pick up on once these get approved they're going to put it in so if somebody wants to walk here this has not been historically a problem so we're solving a problem that isn't a problem i was at every event we had a couple visitors and you know what that's a good thing it gives people that's a chance to showcase our nice city and i think everybody walked away with a very favorable impression of the city so i don't you'll spend more money trying to police it to keep a person out now in terms of giving away food and candy bars and stuff like that that is something you could have the person show an id i went to indian shores memorial day picnic and it was it's open to everyone but residents eat fruit um and if you're not a resident then you have to pay like i don't know eight or ten dollars it was very reasonable but they didn't throw you know that you weren't going to eat at their expense so that's the way to handle that but anybody can go if you want to listen to the music and stuff like that the only other comment i had was i don't see anything here for children um there's there's nothing we had a halloween parade last time we had a christmas uh time with santa and i see now you know we've kind of thrown halloween to the dogs which is you know funny and i think a big cute parade but maybe we get the kids somehow involved you know the kids would be involved in that okay just my understanding is there's 1400 dogs in bellar beach and 12 children and i'm exaggerating i know but like the kids it would be on the invite that the kids could wear the costumes i've been to one of these before and like you know sometimes the kids dress up like their dogs or they do like a co so there would absolutely be dog treats for the dogs and candy for the kids the kids are not excluded in any of this the holiday social would also include such i just didn't detail every little single thing out on this and if you need that i can give it to you i was just that was my impression when i saw it oh yeah no kids would be included we have about a hundred kids they came out pretty well to our events so yeah i know they liked it and you know i think somebody was dorothy and had toto so i mean it could all work together so yeah no it would definitely i mean these are family events so children are absolutely included in anything that we would do council i think they look like good ideas i mean i'm i'm supportive and you know i think that there's a way to do the vote parade i you know generally there are residents that decorate their boats participate in the parade so you maybe have a lead boat that you're paying for but i don't see it being a big expense and i think it's great because clearwater beach has theirs and any rocks has theirs and we don't have one it would be nice if we could be if we could team up with someone on the same day so that you'll get more participation but yeah i think it's a good idea thank you i think they did look into it but i know indian rocks wasn't interested but i mean bellar bluffs is a very logical solution and that would keep it all up here and everything for us so um you know i'm prepared to call for a vote tonight on this uh i think the only thing is we're going to have to get some firm numbers when you as you're going along here so we'll say you know most likely we'll say yeah sure go ahead but then ask you to come back and update us so when you have you know like i don't want to find out that close to 3 dollars for the boat parade we really should vote on that if or give you a second okay if it's going to cost a lot of money some of these are inexpensive so i don't like the parade and things that's not a real big deal so okay okay that's right that's gonna be a i would like to problem another question or two does um city manager lynn reeves or council member dave gaddis have any ideas on how to reach out to the citizens to see how they feel about it i've always been consistent on that and honestly i'm going to stay consistent on it so i hear if the citizens want it i'm not going to be able to give my yes vote so does uh city manager lynn reeves or council member dave gaddis have any ideas on how to reach out to the citizens to find out their feedback and their opinion of it before we even vote on any of this i'm sure that we we can always send out a mailing like a an email version just asking for a response it's not that hard lynn yeah console really we're in the process and patty's going to give you update on our communication new email system that we're putting together as residents turn it in so i think we'll be able to to do that in a more detailed fashion in the next month or so or less uh so we've got patty i think was 219. okay so uh responses back from our surveys uh i don't feel that these are things that are in any way shape or form uh negative to the residents in general because i think the city council based on what i know of it they they wanted to have a few events so these are things they're not large events they're they're it's not like uh we're gonna have a bunch of businesses here or something these are just for the residents and how we'll notify the residents is through the email system that they put out and by the time we're lucky we'll have a sign by may we'll be able to uh put it on the side the website and so so i don't really think it's this this uh event list is in any way a negative thing i think it's a positive thing it's focused towards a residence and that's what's focused at what i was wondering just an idea is this something we could do like management by exception i mean maybe just take out a half-page ad in the newspaper and say hey hillary beach is tentatively planning these events and if you have some strong feelings or ideas call the city manager or the head of our park and recreation board and give us their ideas or concerns so that we can address them and i would imagine that's fairly cheap compared to some surveys or postcards or mailers maybe just two weeks and take out a half-page ad or something i i just don't want to see you know paralysis and by analysis here i i think that we could either put it in maybe your next mailing if you want but i don't see why we can't give them to go ahead tonight to get work on this because this thing made it's jazz in the park sounds simple it's not you got to get your band you got to get your everything set up and you know spread out for coping and stuff like this it's it's there's work to be done and you know you're nodding and you know that there is an id too um so i would like to get you to go ahead uh tonight and you have the other events are october november uh in december you've got plenty of time if citizens come through first off this these meetings will uh minutes will be published i like your idea maybe get you know get a blast out or maybe on his next uh letter to the community or something people have ideas i mean you meet at least monthly now right yeah so i mean get in touch with somebody or come to the meeting or you know get your voice to be heard if you have something to you know good suggestion but some of these suggestions have been kicked around before some of them are new so i i think it's on the same page with where we're heading as a council i mean if anybody wants to make motion to prolong yet but no no my intention was it wasn't too prolonged and i just wanted to make sure that his uh concerns and we can do that in success just the comment of uh blasting it on the digital sign you know we're talking about keeping it for our community we need to be careful what we put on that sign back to why i didn't want the sign you know why it wasn't huge in favor of digital signs because you know you put out there we're having jazz in the park on may 15th then everyone that passes the bridge is going to come to jasmine park on may 15th so when they see that on the side just you know beware dave um basically what i've just read about these events uh they they all look like they're they're minor events i don't think that they're anything that would create mass chaos within the city it looks like something that's uh very low-key and relatively quiet so i i don't have a problem with this and i'll just remind everyone that when we had probably the biggest event that this city's seen in decades which was the festival nothing went off without a hitch there was no disruption to any neighbors or anything here i was at it the entire time the neighbors didn't even know it was happening and we it was you know modestly attended so i don't see that yeah but i mean to joey's point yeah if you advertise it on the sign maybe somebody may go hey may 15th they got jazz in the park and they'll come out but you know for all we know they could be having a you know a world renowned jazz artist and coachmen that same day so you know we're going to be bella beach i think it's going to be modest but i think this will all work so we're not going to have a good stock outside um citizens any comments no citizen comments okay back to council if there's any other questions or comments before we call this for a vote okay so let's clarify we can pull up for tentative approval tonight it'll get you to go ahead but before you like maybe commit to you know big expenditures please come back to us give us an update okay so consideration is the approval for the park and recreation board events for 2021. we have jazz in the park and the family picnic that's may 15 20 21 12 p.m to 3 p.m the halloween dog costume parade and contest october 30th 2021 time to be determined christmas tree lighting and holiday social that's going to be either december 4th or 6th 2021 5 30 p.m and a christmas boat parade right now tentatively scheduled for december 18th time to be determined says time same as indian rock speech but you're going to work that out depending on who else participates uh a yes vote we'll pass this you wanted a roll call vote for this one let's do a roll call vote for this because i said some people may not be with us on this council member aki hi councilmember beam council member gaddis council member shirley aye councilmember swo vice mayor gunn aye mayor manzo aye so this passes six to one thank you for great suggestions here and you're invited every month we're gonna pass we have monthly updates if you don't you don't have to come every month but as you're getting progress please keep us advised and when you're when you have a kind of a phone number on a budget please come to us and give you the final approval on that okay thank you item 10 is a authorization for sole source purchase of away pro way wa stop nps valves for storm and water drainage projects this was put on by the city manager this is uh to purchase check valves for twenty seven thousand eight hundred and fifteen dollars we'll have a motion yes mayor console this is uh authorization to purchase the whey profiles this was part of our stormwater bond loan that we took out is to purchase these valves and to start installation along the streets that we aren't even that are in the future plan going down to 18th street so this is the additional valves we need this is the same provider we've used throughout the city and in the package you'll find the estimate it was updated in january to verify the pricing and the sol source letter they're the sole provider of that file but we're going to stay consistent about what we're putting in so i'm questioning your approval tonight and i have a question for you are these valves i know in the past you sometimes put them in ourselves or self-installed and other times we've had them done by outsiders when they were too big what do you see with these valves are these self-installed jumps we got a couple we'll have to have outsiders but we're getting pretty good at it what streets do you have in mind for these uh we will be 14 15 16 17 and 18. 14 15 16 17. yeah 18. and then let me just say something to the citizens who might be watching or have not familiar with this this is the company you've used in the past they are sole source on this thing truly a sole source we've used them and most importantly when you thought you had some issues with some of these these companies did outstanding services i remember even sending people in from overseas i believe to work with you to make sure these things were working right that's just tremendous service so um i don't have any problem getting behind that but i just want people to understand the level of service they provided to the city manager yeah this this company uh is from switzerland and they actually sent their engineer over here a couple times with us and they spent several days with us and their uh representatives that's in the ford area is very good we've had even had the president the company here a couple times so uh they're behind them and we've we've had good luck it's not going to stop all the flooding but it reduces it and we've had issues with them they've come out spend time and uh you know the flap didn't chat or whatever so uh they're on right now they're on actually first through [Music] and the seventh and eighth street project is ongoing right now but the valve's been put in so that's a good thing just so everyone knows he mentioned it that these won't stop all the flooding so you know if we get a flood if we get a hurricane i thought this these check valves do in fact they actually closed in that event these are for when you get lunar flooding when you get tidal flooding that is they call it sunny day check valves but basically we have a lot of that where you know you have a beautiful sunny day but it's a full moon high tide and all of a sudden we got water in the streets this stops that and it's done a really good job so far he's and he's going through the city street by street to take care of this so all i ask is your approval though okay on top of that too the city manager done some informal testing with his little science fair kid and pretty much disproved any concerns about salt water you want to say that again because that was a i mean this is an important finding that he made i don't i don't yeah it was just a little test to take what's in the street and uh do the parts permitting test on it as opposed to what's in the bay or the intercoastal and uh i might be off a couple numbers but what was in the street was uh the number came up like 270 parts per million and just to do another test i went and took our drinking water and it was like 200 parts per million so what was in the street i guess if you dumped a little iodine in it you'd be fine so remember that in case you don't have water but what was in the uh the salt water was 4 500 and something might have been even higher than that so that was just a test to try to clarify but so they're doing the job that's great council any other comments citizens back to council i would do this as a consensus vote okay okay it's all in favor oh well let me read it okay so this is authorization to let the city manager sole source purchase the waypro wa stop nps valves for stormwater drainage projects it's purchasing check valves twenty seven thousand eight hundred fifteen dollars pursuant to what's in our uh binder packages that we received yes vote we'll give him that authorization all in favor aye aye aye anyone opposed passes seven to zero there's the last two votes okay so it still passes seven to zero thank you manager okay uh we move on to item 11 and the unfinished business lindsay you you were going to update us we're kind of doing a combined we don't have a separate work session this month because we have a long one last month but city management's going to update us do you want to update us here or during your portion yes it is okay um city attorney no sir okay lynn you've dodged it long enough it's all yours there you go just first first blush on the marina rates we we sent out a letter to the marina uh slippery enters and told them as an example of what their new fee was going to be april 1st and we've had a little bit of pushback because of how they're classified and the pushback has come from uh property owners but they don't live here they have as an example there's one person on here that has uh owns two pieces of property here and but they have boats in the marina and if you look at the cost of as an example uh we'll just use mrs zimmerman uh her rate is going up to 170 up 171 dollars from the previous uh 239 dollars with tax so we just wanted to show you the impact uh and we've heard from several of the what what are called the non-resident property owners and their comment basically is i'm a taxpayer why am i paying a premium when i'm a taxpayer so i'm just passing that on to the consul is an information and to get any feedback that you want me to pass on to them because what the resolution says it says full-time residents and their position is their property well miss zimmer and for instance i was gonna ask why does she have two slips i i don't i don't know why we should allow anyone to have two slips i think that that i mean so if she forfeits one of her slips then she's making out ahead actually she won't pay nearly as much as she would if she had too i mean just to start with but you know i i still stand that our prices are fair resident non-resident i do not i mean there are other slips available they can go to other marinas i mean i hate to be difficult about it but i just don't think that we're asking too much for the slip rentals if she lived on the water and chose to keep her doc you know there's i mean i don't know that i don't know the answer but i'm just saying that she doesn't live in the city she owns two properties i have a i'm just struggling with this one for instance you know well the question was that hey i own property here and that's what the question has come from other people so kyle's taking a couple uh well several phone calls from of course the people that say hey i own a property here i pay taxes i'm not getting any benefit that's the question so i just want you to be aware that how many of those do we have uh well if you look on the list where it says n-r-p-o that's a non-resident property number so there's one two there's i think it's seven out of the 19 slips how many of those are rentals what do you mean rentals where they're renting where they're they're making profit on the property uh i couldn't tell you that that you know i i can't i don't have that you know i'd have to go back to the rental registration a condo i'm guessing uh a house uh well i know mr casper is a rental property that i know on 9th street uh condo you know dave i couldn't tell you specifically but i just want to make the console aware yeah are these income producing properties in other words they're residents that their property that they own or they income producing properties over the second homes that would be kind of important to know well i i would venture to say this is just my opinion there i know mr casper's is a rental uh the others are condos and uh i know mr carmichael doesn't rent his his his is his second home but he's stuck in england right now so he goes back and forth but he's not a what i call a he doesn't have a i guess a florida driver's license he probably hasn't i have a comment so basically um the way that i see this is that the marina benefits the residents of bel air beach if you don't hold a driver's license and live here the majority of the time you are technically not a resident of belarus you may you may bring luggage here and stay for a month or two and then you leave your boat year round i don't see how that benefits the full-time residents of belair beach and i think first and foremost residents should always take the front seat on that marina all i'm asking for is just to i'm not asking for anything i'm just trying to give you some feedback from what we've got what kyle's got because kyle has taken over the responsibility for the line do we have a waiting list for people who want to rent yes yeah and and we're going to redo the policy to kind of clarify that a little better because it's it's been a while it's just like the rental rates it was 2007 is the last time they were raised well my thought is to me it seems like they had a really good deal really cheap deal and now that it's comparable and still a good deal they're unhappy with that and so i guess we could say well i mean this is how it is if you don't like it there's other places you can go knowing that we have other people that would jump on the opportunity to win so i think we're in a good position that we're not trying to make them happy because we need them because we don't have anybody else that wants it and it would be lost income we have a waiting list so i don't think we need to be pushovers i think we need to stick to our guns and say this is how it is now all i'm doing is paying you a heads up okay that's all this is i think the comments that have been i just have to i'm not going to add a lot to it that hasn't been said i think joey's comment uh robin's comment and the guys that's what we were talking about as we were going through this and i agree with everyone what everybody said that was our thinking as far as i'm concerned i would vote for no changes on this and i hear them i'm also with jody two boat slips i mean we only have 18 slips and somebody's got two of them i mean that you know we got a waiting list of what 30 people 40 people and somebody has two that's that's pretty good um you know they actually have two boats of their own i don't know um maybe something yeah they do okay that's great i mean but that's very very fortunate in a nice marina like ours so um i i you know i think the market will dictate what's the best value and i think bella beach marine is a good value right now okay so let's see if anybody else is [Music] uh i don't have that with me right now but i can send it out so the constant knows that i'll send it out in the morning it's not a problem and my only other comment is actually to our city attorney does he foresee any issues between [Music] well my response to that would be when you pass a resolution you you made a deter a decision that it was going to be residents so that that was the legal standard you set that is different than property owner if you ever want to change it the legal standards you certainly have the ability to do that you simply have to do a changes to the ordinance and that would allow you to change the legal standards so i i would mirror what has been said the last few minutes you should enforce the standards that you put in place and it would appear to me the distinctions that are being made or to the typical distinctions that are being made when somebody is trying to find a way to pay less somehow all right i am uh i'm showing this is if this is the most recent update we've got a total of 80 around 80 people that are on the wait list i would say more than half probably about two-thirds are non-residents we've got around 20 that are property owners and two that are residents that are currently on the list you know just just so the council knows we we send out uh something to those the wait list every year and kyle has done that already i don't know that it's compiled totally up to date yet but because people put their name on it and then this patty knows because she used to run it the people will put their name on it and then they if you don't contact them to say hey it's a new year are you still interested they'll leave their name on for whatever so we try to do that make that distinction every year so i think we're fine with it i just wanted to make sure that the council was aware that we had a little push back from a few people and i didn't want you uh how do i say it sideswiped and somebody show up here and say something to you you didn't know about it so we're good with that uh the next thing i want to talk about is part of the lincoln speaking to that mike because yeah the next thing i want to talk about is is uh the speed limit request i spoke to the county uh spoke to tom marshburn he said they'd probably have to do a speed study both cities would have to agree and they would look at the fdot speed zoning handbook to look at that and i did request an additional flashing light for around 7th street the one here at the causeway is is uh in the plan already for coming across the bridge so and one other thing we'll have some data monthly data from the one that's going north he told me that as they pull down the monthly data he'll send me that report so we can kind of update and see where that's at so those are the steps uh i've asked him about doing the speed study and i did ask the sheriff but i haven't got the report back i wanted to find out if there were any crashes related to speed on causeway or causeway or gulf over the last i asked him for 24 months so they're going to give me that report also so i'll bring that back to the console in the future but that's where we're at right now with the speed uh on that side you might want to consider since you're replacing that for people going north to place it before the crosswalk not afterwards we want them to slow down before they hit the crosswalk yeah we're we're talking about between seven and eight well i'm saying between six and before you get to six because you're wanting yeah i got the impression from all the discussion that the work session that the speed was more going that direction as opposed to coming this direction it is that it's where the motorcycle races seem to go yeah okay so so that's when i what i asked but see that would be in the right way so that's counting right away so that that has no real issue there so and as i said they will give us some data from that the other thing we talked about was zoom meeting uh you're getting a little taste of it tonight uh but myself and kyle and the vice mayor accompanied us over to bel air and jp was uh the city manager uh very insightful took us spent it was probably an hour with us gave us some information things that we could buy that to create that zoo meeting once we all go to ipads and everything uh and to eliminate that feedback issue uh he gave uh told us about a box that you buy for 150 bucks so we we've got that we're going to do some testing and we'll keep you up to date where we're at as we move along so one thing he did mention they have what i call a bar mic it's about it's like a sound bar on the tv and they were scattered along their dice and uh it was kind of interesting because he didn't have them all up there when i was there but i could walk to like we'll say where robin's at and the mic might have been where jody's sitting and you could pick up my voice and uh so i thought that was interesting and those are things that we probably need to upgrade the system and that'll help us with what i do what everybody does with the microphone so uh that's we'll do the additional testing we've asked for some pricing on the mics and we'll get some more information back to you so that's an update on that well the last thing we talked about majorly at the work session was the impact fee uh the impact fee for pinellas county for it's called a multi-modal uh impact fee it was changed uh probably a year and a half ago used to be that anybody that built a new house if there was a house on the lot they got 100 credit well that's changed uh since sometime in late 19 so what would happen is the base fee from ellis county is two thousand sixty six dollars and that's for a house it's twenty five hundred square feet if they had a house on it today uh and they tore it down and the house was between fifteen hundred and twenty four hundred square feet they'd get sixteen hundred dollar 1679 dollar credit towards that fee and if it was below 1500 they'd get 1356 dollars credit against that impact fee previously it didn't matter what size the house was if if it was a thousand square foot house and you put a 2500 square foot house the impact there was no impact fee so and how that works is it's it's a county wide fee it's charged based on the county's section 150 so now what will happen with the us and i even went back and looked to see if the city ever collected any impact fees the last impact fee that was collected was 2008. uh but i know in the few years i've been here most of the most of the new homes have been a tear down home now recently we've got houses that are vacant lots so to get their co they'll be paying an impact fee to us for multimodal uh we get 50 of the 2066 dollars uh 50 goes to pinellas county we also get four percent of their 50 for an administrative fee so that's another 40 50 bucks so we'll end up getting a little over a thousand dollars maybe 1100 out of each new home and if it's a home that was tore down we'll have one as an example that's on 12th street uh in a very new future uh that was a tear down last year so they'll get some credit based on the size of the house and to verify that we'll use the property appraiser's estimate of the square footage of the house now right now there are several houses being built on brand new lots that didn't have a house on them or they haven't for a very long time so we'll have to if somebody wants a credit they're going to have to prove to us that there was a house on there so those will collect the full fee so i hope that's your answer to the transportation impact fee but it was a county-wide fee as far as sewer and water those are collected by pinellas county and we don't have a part impact fee and that's pretty much the major ones and i'm going to ask jody any other major ones other than in a development well i there's a couple of things that i see where we're missing the boat and that is we're not we're not doing like an environmental permit or no nsp sort of inspection or management from our team so i think that that would be somewhere where we're going out before they tear down the house before they start construction make sure silk fence is in place make sure that we're not having any runoff into the street and there should be a fee for that we need to you know oversee these projects and make sure that we're keeping them clean the the one project we talked about last last month i noticed there's no silt fence along the roadways there is dirt in the gutter that dirt goes into our sewer system so we've got issues there that it's just not being maintained to standards you know construction standards the other thing is um i just got a development order from city largo for two units there's a park fee on there i mean i would i'll be happy to share it with you no no when we're looking at our comprehensive plan we need to consider them and i think that that we're missing the vote on controlling development a little bit more well there are there are park park fees in many cities um you know i guess the city had never even entertained it as an example but uh there is a fee for their uh they pay a fee to us for the demolition it's it's a forty dollar fee uh and that's for the npds requirement and the seal fence we go out and do an inspection we tell them to fix it if we have to go again and tell them to fix it then there's a hundred dollar fee that we charge them but we don't require self-defense around new projects that's what that oh no but it's required around a new project well it's not up there well kyle i know goes out weekly there's never been so fenced on that those two houses they have one has chain link fence around it the other one has nothing and there the road is covered in dirt and has been every time i've gone by there so recently that yeah the recently the county dug up the uh sewer line tap and i know they're going to go across the street which mayor i'm telling you ahead of time you may hear i heard about it you told me about this one i know i know the situation so uh you know we we'll you know get a stronger enforcement on the silk fence so i guess the question is how do we how do we develop some procedures for this because i don't i think that we don't have good procedures and i'm not sure that you know if it's the comprehensive plan where we address this and we really sit down and put together a task force to look at it and say is there opportunity for us to clean up our development order or how we issue permits how do we go about doing that well the cop plan will we can discuss that more i'm sure with the impact fees and that will be starting here shortly because i've gotten the agreement and got it taken care of with the county we've we have an analytical agreement with foreign pinellas to do that type of work force and linda fisher is going to be the person that's going to take care of that so she'll be starting shortly actually priced sometime later this month in february because so can i get involved in that or is that something that just happens and we find out about it at a council meeting no no that stuff will be done and then it goes the planning board reviews it so i mean you're welcome to be involved it has yeah i'd like to talk to her if i could okay that's not okay so i mean going through the silk fence issue i don't know how this one slipped through i know when i built my house the city was eminently involved and if it actually my neighbor knocked it down by accident they were building their pool in the back and somebody gave us a call and like get that thing back up so i mean we were always pretty vigilant on that i can say it from personal experience so we should stay vigilant through our code and you know through our city inspections well there are requirements we you know the public works group is supposed to do an inspection on all the silk vents routinely and i understand what you're saying about 15th street uh the county most of that mud that's in the street is because the county dug up the the road there or not the road they dug up the curb and all that stuff along there when they do that do they come i noticed they patched on hibiscus i asked about why they had it opened up they replaced a manhole and they patched where they worked but they did a whole lot of other damage the street is just a mess now and what's the plan for that who who's responsible for that well if they did something they did then we can go back to the county and they'll fix it i know we had that issue on the curb by the mayor's house so we'll just go back to the county and talk to them there i will tell you this the like the one on hibiscus the county is in that area is not good about telling you unless you go ask them they don't notify anybody uh because it's their sewer system and they figure well i'm digging it up or the contractor here that as the as the case was on 7th street so you know i talked to those guys last week and said hey you know when you start digging up stuff here you need to tell us because residents call us and you know we're saying well what happened here and you know so it's more like we have to go ask them they don't come and tell us and to that note i mean you know some of the work that they've done locally by me if they're going to turn off the water i know it's not a precise thing but if they could let you know so you can blast it out to everyone at least on either a quick email or at least on the website you know you're in the one day i mean we're in the middle of taking a shower and they cut the stuff off and it's like this is great you know i mean i'm all for progress but they know that that stuff is coming it wasn't an emergency you know that's right right do we have an agreement with the pinellas county for i mean clearly we have some sort of easement agreement or something that allows them to have their utility on our property and maybe this is a question for fred but can we review those agreements fred and there's not really an agreement uh i mean the city sold the sewer system they own it they own it but so it runs through the city's property so they must have an easement with the city of some sort well if they get it if they have a in some cases they'll come and get a right-of-way permit or something like that but you know if it's damage that is an emergency to fix they go fix it i don't think on hibiscus it was because clearly they moved in a bunch of equipment and had it staged for a day or two before they opened the road up so there must have been something to do with the manhole it was a problem that's what i was told it was a problem with and they had to change a valve out that's what i was told so i don't know i know there's no agreement we have an annual general permit agreement with the county uh but that's a question i can ask i i don't you know i know we did sell the sewer system to the county and they provide our water service i was just going to say that's all fair and well i mean i understand that when you have an emergency or some sort of oxygen circumstance they need to come out here and cut off the water or something but for normal operating recurring maintenance stuff i mean you brought up that concern did they acknowledge it or i mean it seems to me as well who you're dealing with in the street is is not who we really need to deal with well no i i understand that so what support do you need from the council do we need to write a strong letter to the county or something i'll i'll talk to uh i'm blanking in franklin's name joe graham i'll i'll talk to him and see what he tells me and i'll i'll bring you any information he gives me okay can i i can say that a professional courtesy i don't expect to when people just show up on your doorstep and cut off the water or turn off the traffic lights or something well i think that if a in some cases if they turn the water off it it could have been the contractor needed like on 7th street the contractor needed to do something because there was an offset i'm guessing but uh in some cases as i said they the county is not real good at sharing a lot of information as far as that well i think maybe they're just not getting the feedback people just kind of accept it and it's just you know it's kind of like the 7th street [Applause] lift station you know i've been around i've been around with them and they they're doing this and they're doing that and um but i will say in some cases they work with you in other cases it's it's just a thing that they don't tell you what they're really doing i mean to glenn's point though you know i know i met joe graham when we did the uh one of the tours and i mean if we need to do a letter from council or resolution or something that you have a little bit more teeth you know with that i mean let them know that we are concerned i mean it may not seem like anything but glenn said they show up at your doorstep you know what glenn they don't even give you that courtesy you just see a guy out there with a we know what the fridge what the tool looks like now it looks like a big t but you see that guy on the corner it's like oh you know you better get moving because he's uh he's gonna cut your water they don't tell you how long and you know everybody's standing out in the street going how long is this going to be it's like no one knows you know so they could do a little bit better in that regard like you know even if they tell you the day before like we're going to be cutting your water tomorrow you get up early do whatever you got to do and you know be ready for them so okay i've got a list of things so go ahead and keep going i mean you know what i mean just so everyone knows we're not having a work session so this is kind of like a work session here with this part of the thing that's what we had planned on before i had spoke with lynn so that's why the question and answer mark getting back to construction just recently we had a pool built on louisa while they drove over the curve with a cement truck and parked it between the two homes now they drove over some water lines cable lines with a symmetric i don't know if we have a rule with a county when their permit is issued to keep the cement trucks on the street and use a pumper to pump the concrete well the same thing goes with tearing down a house there's damage that could be done with the curbs we don't go out and inspect before the houses tore down so they could be damaged with a bulldozer going over those curves well we we are starting to take pictures of those curves when the house has been demolished and so we're trying to get a little more forceful with the uh contractors and i i think it'll work to to our advantage in the long term i don't know you know a property owner that allows them to back their cement truck up i mean you're you're you're kind of limited on what you can control i mean uh i don't know where that happened was that that house on the corner doctor ward's attack awards yeah okay they tore out they tore out everything for that side because they're building a new swimming pool in the back i will tell you having done many a spent job when i was younger um it's impossible to get the spent truck driver to come off the paved surface so whoever did that that's definitely not up to their normal protocol because they're so worried that they're going to sink into the into the ground center right and then the any other questions on that subject and the last subject just to let you know on the utilities i i had asked fred is there do you have any experience dealing with that and is that something that you know where you might write a letter or draft a letter or you know how do we get communication with pinellas county and our utility companies to provide a courtesy call to the city if they're going to be moving in and ripping a road apart i mean they literally close roads and don't tell anyone lynn had no idea the road was closed um i've not read the contract when they went over to seoul which must have been a number of years ago so it'd be to give you a good answer and be helpful to know what's in it um they're the i think the real solution for the short term is what lynn said he would do already which is to reach out to them and make them aware that the council is you know unsettled about some of the ways that they're doing business and notify get give them a informal notice of it and if you know quite frankly he doesn't get a very good reaction to that then i think the thing to do is for him to tell the council and for y'all to direct something that's more you know memorialized that better states the position i i what i would hope is another government entity would be responsive to the concerns that lynn explained to women would you know that in itself would solve the problem although that isn't the way it always works yeah the the uh the other thing i'm working on is i know you've seen some of these half telephone poles next to a tall telephone pole or utility pole uh i'm working on getting some of those dead wires off by i guess pushing the issue with with as an example there's a lot of wires in the city that are not active and the unfortunately these vendors like spectrum or frontier is the biggest abuser of that they don't want to come out and move their utilities to the next poll that's brand new so i've been working on that and made some phone calls and made some contacts and at least i'm getting a little a little bit forward movement from frontier uh because they're the ones that put the horizon lines well they're they're the verizon was a predecessor for those of you that may or may not have lived here when they did that i don't know probably 10 years ago maybe when they put the fiber in they left a lot of overhead stuff and i will tell you that the last line on the underground project is due to come down next week and the underground project in bellevue states island will be complete so this is a good thing it took us a while but it'll be complete so and then the final thing is the electronic cameras we got two bids for that uh it came in at uh the low bid was fourteen thousand two hundred and three dollars and the next higher bid was 17 866 and i'll put that on for approval in the march meeting because the business just came in and if everything goes right we'll have the signed bid also on march it's due the 16th and if you don't have any other questions that's all i got and i just have a piece of information for you i'm going to go over some of the stuff that happened at the big c meeting but it may have even reached out to you already but a couple of the mayors started discussing the pooling of heavy-duty equipment example it ensures that they just bought a bucket loader and they said you know there's no reason why other cities up and down the coast can't share other utilities i mean we all don't need to buy a bucket loader but like they said we all hang up christmas decorations and maybe that can be coordinated so it was something that came up we didn't get really in depth on it but it sounds like a very smart idea um and i don't know if the city managers will start speaking with each other or maybe they've already reached out but that idea is out there and you may be hearing about it in the future yeah the county is uh is has put an agreement together uh i don't know if that's what they're talking about and we want to participate in it it's like loaning equipment unfortunately for us we'd be the borrower we don't really have anything to loan unless you need a pickup truck uh but if if we can be part of it of course you know i'll bring something to the console because that's a benefit i mean to us i mean i'm not sure how it would work we can get into the detail and you know i mean obviously they don't i'm sure they don't want to be a rental agency but you know if you're going to go out and like you did tree trimming i think the other year you have to rent the thing so right now yeah so i mean you know they have to park probably in their backyard nobody's using it so you know if we could help out another town and not wind up having to go into war over it i mean it would be great you know so something to think about i know we don't really have much to offer i think we just have an extra like i said an extra pickup truck so right which i could have used last weekend but you weren't around so just kidding i don't want anybody all right anything else anybody have any questions for lynn okay um this is just the first numbers on the community survey just to give you an idea of of how it's going like len said we have approximately 219 and of those and i'm going to break it down the email they're asking 205 want the email 100 want the mobile text 24 want the automated voice system 49 want the website 131 facebook 48 newsletter and 13 message board [Music] how long does that open until that uh that response period i don't think we put a close date did we we didn't put a close date on it uh i expect another week to 10 days with this was the first week since the mailing that we got back last week and uh prior to that uh we got some in mail some went online and did it um but you know i'm expecting right now we got 17 of the population or 17 of the addresses based on the number of homes and condos in valor beach if it gets to 25 will probably be fortunate i don't think it'll get much higher than that i mean and that'll give us a list of about 300 people 300 residents uh and and our previous uh constant contact list was 469 so that kind of gives you an idea that hey maybe we've out of that list and we're going to cross-check them because we want to see if we gained anything from the previous list and so we'll quit using that old list and we're going to start using this new list as we build it and we just keep adding to it and we'll keep the survey on the website if somebody fills it out and sends it in hey that's great but you know i'm anticipating probably we get another hundred because usually the influx is immediate um when we send out the blast i think we got like 100 115 with that email blast from the constant contact list and we picked up maybe another 100 from this anything else no i have comment for you we've been like goldilocks and the three bears with the uh with the minutes you know sometimes they're too long sometimes they're too short i read through the ones we had and this is just me speaking they were just right this time i mean they were perfect they were to the point they had all the key points i don't think there was one word in there that even really wasn't necessary as far as i'm concerned this was the minutes of the last two events were outstanding as far as i you know i had no comments whatsoever but they were excellent so great job thanks thank you any other comments let's go to the city council then robin october 1st the only thing i have for you is we have a tree on 22nd and louisa it's on the north side second house between the first and second house the tree is in the right way it's in the right way right at the curve so if a truck goes by or an suv goes by the branches of that palm and that's something we've talked about before all the trees and bushes next to the roadway that blocked the site in the line of sight but that one's the only one that sticks out look at that anything a few thoughts along with the zoom meeting [Music] what i took away from bel air was it's doable and it's affordable and in my brief networking trying to get some interest in the citizens advisory committee this idea of remote attendance is very big people are very interested in this hey you know man i want to be down there mixing it up in public and or i'm a busy person and i can't schedule it into my day to be there personally but this remote tennis stuff is good stuff so i know kyle's involved in this and the city manager is working hard to make this thing a timely event for us professional courtesies you know i've got to think that the county is scheduling their preventative maintenance and recurring maintenance weeks months quarterly ahead and the idea of just giving our city managers a week notice heads up hey we're going to have bucket trucks and earth movers and back-end loaders in your neighborhood you know two weeks from now i don't consider that to be an impossibility and i think we just need to give them some very strong feedback that hey you know that's that's just how we do business and that's a professional courtesy uh along the lines of impact fees i think uh joey's spot on some of this stuff and it boils down to truly understanding what the cost of doing business is i mean nothing is too little that we we need to understand what the cost of it is maybe it's just our person jumping in the car and spending a half hour to drive around and check sediment fences but that's a cost to the city we can't just chop it off too well it takes 30 minutes to do that and everything it all started when we did our inventory of the city you know what do we own what's it cost to maintain it what's it cost to use it stuff like that it's just trying to get a accountant's idea of what's the cost of doing business around here and factor that into our budgets and all of our strategic planning lastly the cable companies and this all came to light as we're trying to finish up the underground and project there and you wander around and you see all these coils and pigtails of unused cable and stuff just diked off and hanging from telephone poles and it's putting something on my radar scope and that is we need to tighten up our contract in our franchising there there are standards of workmanship and acceptable stances of quality workmanship and i don't expect anybody to walk on anybody's property just diaper wire and leave it hanging there i think we need to look at our contracts i think we need to look at our permits and say hey this is the standard of workmanship that we expect we need to look at our contract and build in penalties hey if you don't meet a deadline if you don't meet the quality if you have to redo something this is the cost of that kind of stuff and i think for too long we've just kind of had the old contracts and it was just plugged sharp border plate and or that's how business is done and i think it's really time to put our foot down and hey if we want to be a premier community then this is what we expect of workmanship in our community and i'll be kind of keeping that in the forefront i guess that's all i have thank you glenn i just want to jump out there man i brought it up and i think we've always brought it up you know some companies do that um i know when a power company behind our house was trimming out the trees that were touching the wires they gave us like a week or so advanced notice and there's going to be crew out here doing it but you know to the point i mean it wasn't funny that day i think we had a council meeting that day and you know i'm sitting around shaving i haven't showered and these guys are cutting the water and it's like you don't know if it's coming on or not the other week i was asking is it okay to pull up the flags in my front yard and you know i mean you don't want to pull it up if it's not necessary nobody wants to hurt somebody or do any you know unnecessary work but you know one of my neighbors had i'm like no you can take them out now you know but they don't nobody knows they'll leave them in there forever so to glenn's point i mean it's supposed to be a nice community you wouldn't tolerate it if any other contractors did so you know these guys just a little extra just tell us what to do and hey you could give a quick notice you know code could run up and down and hit every door on 7th street or 10th street or whatever there's no 10th street 9th street and you know and say um what happened to 10th street um so you know just let them know that the construction is over you can remove the flags nobody minds taking it out but at the glen's point they leave a half a telephone pole in your backyard what gives i mean if we did that on a construction job you know county or the city would be all over us so i think we have to ask the same of them well i will tell you this i i called the psc because i and what i got told by then was well we don't control the cable and internet companies anymore okay so who controls them yes that was told the department of agriculture so i called the department of agriculture oh we don't control them we just take complaints [Music] i mean the lady was very nice and she says well i don't know where you go so uh now i've got to call into the fcc because somebody there's got to be some control of them somewhere but i know that they did away with that the psc issue but i thought they still had some some kind of control on them but they they told me no they did away with that in 2011. and it's just like the little telephone poles with the big boot on the top of them you know other than get a runaway permit we have no control over those they can put them wherever they want but that's because the state changed the law so uh we'll keep digging at it you know something along those similar lines is 5g and we've had this discussion before we have no say when they come in say hey we're going to put in a 5g tower right here we have no saying that and some of the cities are getting smart about this and creating ordinances and standards for at least hey it has to blend with the aesthetics of the city so while you may not have any say in where it goes you have some say what it's going to look like and all of a sudden the 5g companies have to work with the cities on their permitting process and acknowledging hey there are some scans we need to comply with so that may be something our ordinance or our code review people want to take a look at okay one question it just came to me and um the beach walkovers what is the completion schedule of those because they are taking a long time and well they had they had a 90-day schedule that ends march 1st it looks like they'll be done in the next couple weeks but it was much more cost effective to do them all at once as opposed to do one and then move to another one so i mean they're this close to finishing yeah and they just aren't wrapping up when i go they just have it looks like the sidewalks closed forever they're not coming back you know all they needed actually i know they were there today they're they're finishing up uh the railings and uh once they're done we'll we'll do a walk through and make sure that they did everything within the contract and then we'll close the contract and open them the things but the reason we did it all at once because it was more cost effective okay thank you vice mayor your point i i was going to go to my stuff but i think the 5g has merit to it i know there was preemption out of tallahassee on some of it i did not bother to read the big long thing but i know there's a certain preemption but if this is something that we as a council want to because i'm going to give you a couple things to think about for maybe the next work session so i don't know something we want to maybe get a preliminary from legal but what is our right i know there's a certain preemption but what can be made can these you know govern aesthetics because i get the feeling that to your point one day we're gonna wake up and somebody's gonna be shoving one of these you know in our backyard and we may not like it so the time to act is now when no one is doing anything so if we want to do it if we get mr riley to you know to do the just see what the preemption is and then we can kind of take it from there can we you know can we govern aesthetics because i thought tallahassee put a pretty darn tough preemption on it but that's about what i know on it i think it was a league of cities clip that i read on it once so are you okay on that okay limited threat i mean just see what we have okay so a couple other things i'm going to bring to your attention um we've talked about this one a while the park boats i'm not a boater okay so i have a dog in this fight but it seems like every time i go over the bridge these things are like mushrooms and there's more of them sprouting up we i talked about in madeira beach had a uh i believe an excellent um ordinance that they passed which actually sent them all up here um we may want to get that one and act on it because to me and jody i know you have a boat some of their own people have them to me that channel is starting to get pretty crappy there are the areas surrounding the channel so see what everybody thinks about it but maybe again something that we put for the march work session if we all have interest i see a nodding of heads here so that's something we want fred maybe to take a quick look at and see what madeira beach has and good yeah okay just limited fred i mean it seemed to work there drove them out i i didn't know you could control the maritime waters as a city but if we can um let him go to the next town up because it's it's starting to come a lot but one day we went over there was one of ground next to the condo in bel air bluffs it not looking so good you know another thing that we should start thinking about because it was a topic at the big c and a couple of the cities are actually drafting legislation toward it is these electric bicycles and electro electric scooters on the beach now i've not personally witnessed it but when i go to the beach it's usually in bellaire shore and dollar shore has had just an overall prohibition on it but apparently what one of the mayors was saying is the state has changed the definition of bicycle to include these electric scooters and it's the law of unintended consequences they wanted people to drive the electric scooters around the city which was what it was really designed for but now people are driving on the beach and they're starting to have problems so other cities indian shores i think indian rocks was working on this we don't we may have a problem the folks who swim up in our portion of the beach in valley beach i don't know what you've seen but i wanted to bring it to our council attention does it seem to be an issue at the big city well we we've had a couple issues our code says no motorized so you know i guess if we and i did hear about that uh the statement that a bicycle if it's got a motor on it doesn't count is a motorized thing like a hoverboard or what was that thing you used to drive around i can't even think of the name of it but a segways yeah segway uh because because you've got you've got people that even come out on our beach with those little uh segways without arms on them i guess that's what they are so we probably need to find out if that is true but our ordinance says no motorized well technically in my mind those are motorized that they they aren't by people power so uh and we've had a couple complaints about that unfortunately we haven't caught them because you know we've had the complaints and then you know if deputy goes and looks and they're gone it's kind of like the dogs can't have a dog on the beach but it happens and the deputies gotta catch him not you know just because hearsay is doesn't work so it'll be interesting to hear what feedback i get from from that in the future here about the bicycles if they're really doing that call it a bicycle with a motor yes they are that's the problem well again the idea was in the inner you know inner cities where they have like these places they wanted people to take the electric bicycles and you know unintended consequence yeah they're taking them they're taking them up and down the beach which is what people don't want um something else and again consider this hearsay it was said by one of the mayors so it's not verified but they were saying that the sheriff said that they weren't going to enforce that law i have seen the sheriff enforcing the bicycle along bellar shore so i i don't know what's coming i've seen it with my own eyes i've been forcing it so i don't know that that's correct information that they were given but maybe next time you're speaking with captain liner see what he has to say but if we need to pass or tighten up our legislation again this is the time to do it lynn's got a couple complaints i didn't even know about that but the other communities are all complaining about it and i imagine as the beaches get crowded in the next couple months we're going to start hearing more and more about this unfortunately if they were writing them responsibly that would be one thing it doesn't sound like that's the case they're speeding up and down and it's just a matter of time before somebody gets run over and it'll probably be one of our residents so something to think about for for next time um the other thing is uh this is like jason and friday the 13th it just never dies but the short-term rental bill is back up in tallahassee it's um number hb 219. so just keep an eye on it i mean it seems to not quite ever make it over the hump but you know if it ever does make it over to home folks um you know enjoy the bed and breakfast next door to you because it's going to be a problem we will not be allowed to control it from our own council tallahassee will control it for us so it's out there um just keep an eye on on house bill 219. i don't know if there's a companion to that and lastly i had um we had an update at the big c from dr cho who's the advisor to the governor here and it was about the vaccine program and i just want to give you a little idea because you know you may hear stuff you might read stuff online this is from the governor's office uh and i it's only pinellas county that i really was concerned about but they're running about eight to ten thousand vaccines per week that they're doing here the problem is we have 250 000 senior citizens 65 and over in pinellas county so to do the math that's about 25 weeks to get them the first vaccination and most of them require two vaccinations so you know i asked him i said did we talk in close to 50 weeks at this rate and he said yes so it's you know now they expect that the vaccine supply is going to get better and if it does then this number should come down but that's where we're at right now and the thing i brought up to him which infuriated me was i read about um there was a guy he actually was bragging about this he came from mexico he was an immediate member of their media got that vaccine in miami and he posts it out on social media thanks america for the vaccine and i'm like how could you let this happen you know we got senior citizens here who don't have it so he he was unaware of it and i made sure i sent him a copy of it and uh so hopefully that kind of abuse won't happen i know the governor said if you see it to let them know um i hope that the people who do get them will get them but uh it looks like it's going to be you know a while before we get through even the first group so that's an update and if i hear more i'll let you know i don't know if you heard anything to get a shot now you've got to produce a mortgage a driver's license to prove that you actually even if you're a winter visitor you have to show them a mortgage to get them it's all stated uh i was fortunate to get a shot last week don't have a mortgage huh you don't have a mortgage no no property tax bill yeah no they wouldn't take property tax they wanted to the list said a deed a driver's license a utility bill but they looked at the deed i don't know which she didn't really look at very good but it didn't matter i had an id card so did you did you get yours in pinellas mask or you did you go i got it in the largo the first one right so yeah i mean it is happening but it's uh it's a slow roll down right now martha it's doable i understand the state has a computerized system now too it's a little bit better than when they initially rolled it out so anyway we're on it i mean the big c is talking about it so um that was it was nice to get that update at least directly because you read too much in the newspaper and it's not always correct all right folks that's all i had um with that i'll ask for a promotion to adjourn did anybody have any other topics before i mean this is kind of a hybrid work session at this point we're in selection science council but did we cover everything glenn did you did someone say something i said so okay so we're gonna journal okay uh second second all in favor hi good night everyone"
