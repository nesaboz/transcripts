riefler mr lynn reeves and council member jody shirley has not arrived thank you patty we have one item on this agenda which is the continuation of discussion and review of the city lrt fiscal year 2022 2023 budget immediately following this meeting we will have a special council meeting for consideration of setting the tentative military for fiscal year 2022 and 2023 i'd like to thank lynn reeves for joining us and lynn i've asked that you be here to assist kyle as needed although lynn is joining us i request all council members to direct their questions directly to kyle but please wait until called on to help me keep some order to this meeting before we begin but we had a piece of information that was handed out to us during this meeting i have not seen this one yet it was given to us by mike would you like to go ahead and discuss this we that should be probably addressed during the village conversation oh it's the mail yeah okay sorry all right we'll just continue moving forward so what we've got is our budget our proposed budget and uh the last time that we met on this uh we did have some questions uh there were also some suggestions i noticed that we receive updated date there's a publication date on the uh the new proposed budget so what i was going to do was uh just start by going around the room and giving each council member the opportunity to ask questions what i would like for everyone to do is just wait till your call and then once i call on you i want you to call out the page number exactly what what budget item it is that we are discussing uh also pay would you please make a note that council member has arrived and that is at 6 00 thank you all right so why don't we just start going to my right here mr roberts yes sir well thank you for the opportunity actually i know when each of us had an opportunity to meet with um atlanta city manager i know i met with him for a couple of hours to review the budget at that time i brought up a couple of few things at that particular meeting those have already been addressed so i'm good okay thank you very much council member banker um i went through the budget page by page i got some things i'm sure you've memorized this bet at all do you see any places where we could cut the budget say disappointment rather than what is proposed here i mean i'm sure he went over with i'm not trying to put you on the spot but we're going to get interviewing you tomorrow but what i'm saying is this is what you'll have to work with so what do you think i'm asking is that a fair question any question you'd like to ask i think it's a i think it's a well put together budget if if given goals to to cut it by a certain percentage uh if i could explore that coming around this year i think it's a good solid budget my questions we're facing i guess last this last week was a nine percent inflation rate so far expected into double digits digits by the end of the year so would it be feasible to cut anything anything sticking out in your mind is what you're saying nothing jumps right out at me some of the things that you guys brought up could be looked at or adjusted if that's how you wanted to go into this budget here as far as like with the code enforcement we could budget it lower for the cut in the five hours these software we're talking about in finance that can be adjusted all right excuse me what i'm not the only person here in the noise too it's my insulin pond it's nothing i could turn off otherwise i'll die so okay all right i just want to make sure i wasn't losing whether batteries were doing that or something all right i'm sorry please continue i think he gave me my answers okay [Music] i have no questions about the budget i think it's a very very good budget it's got like you know with the uncertainty that's going on in the world i think it's great i i'd be very happy for it the way it is thank you very much judy shirley well just a couple of things just to start off with is the budget includes city manager lynn reeves that recently changed but as i go through it under on page 14 [Applause] under the capital funds we've got roughly 1.1 million dollars in our governmental i'm not sure about the field where is that where are those ones coming so that that's the funds that are allocated for the capital projects from the general so it's everything we have in reserve for those capital projects is that the way i should go to the capitol section and you see the summary which is on page [Applause] 47. and in this section it lays out all of the capital projects that are saved up for planned out so that summarizes i guess my i guess what i'm have to struggle is i don't see a tie to number anywhere like shouldn't i see that number coming out of a bun somewhere and i'm just having a struggle finding your question about lynn do you know how that works are you talking about the on page 14 the interfund transfers down at the bottom no both intergovernmental of the capital funds i see where we're utilizing reserves that's clearly under general okay let me part of the inner governmental property is the uh i remember right it's the money for boulevard let's see 47. all full of art is uh 930 000. right no i'm just trying to find the right the gulf boulevard is 930. uh i'm trying to find what the other additional is are we getting anything kyle from the county sorry what what do you ask me i'm sorry that's a question jody what i'll do i'll look at this a little more detail and get back to you on that and everyone i'll send an email too [Applause] okay i think it's part of the goat blowbar [Applause] okay um and maybe i'll just answer that question no okay so on page 17 we've got revenues the revenues and expenditure summary and there's other financing sources and it's 391 000 do you know what that is [Applause] [Music] you said that was on page 17 page 17 under i'm not sure yeah it's two years is that what the other financing sources are that's not the right number i can tell you that no it's not this she's so is it everything outside of the avalor pad door is that what i'm i mean i'm trying to get some someone to give me some feedback here well the no the 2.48719 that is the f4 plus you know the other revenues that we get in like licenses yeah uh that money comes from like utility and franchise taxes if you add those numbers up i'm just trying to find where that number flowed in from uh what the and she put it over there and trying to find where it flows from not available [Applause] i think important to know because if we have revenues coming from somewhere other than our you know regular operating revenues we might might be an opportunity to work on uh tweaking those to get them up a little higher whatever these revenues are well we have the other revenues with the finance of the the franchise agreements the state sales tax [Music] but lynn right above that is operating revenue so those would be included in that correct right right yeah so i just i need some clarification what that is if i could please which review are you it says other financing sources considered revenue and there's nothing on the breakdown uh i do have just a quick question on page 21 we have no election expenses in the 22 23 budget but don't we have a fall election it doesn't it doesn't affect us is that we just provide them in the facility right okay there are expenses last year just a couple of things and i'm just looking purely going down the butt you know the budget budget expenses and wherever i see a major change in expenses i'm kind of highlighted you know here i see a 1200 power lines i know we've talked about that before well oh i'm sorry on page 26. and the reason i ask about it because it's up 100 so that i think the reasoning was because lynn was doing all that and now we don't have lenders yet am i correct in saying that and i believe this year we added laura to uh because she runs back and forth to the bank for the deposit i'd like to make a comment on that um normally a car allowance is given to like the ceo or one of the top executives of the company not to just everyone and it seems like we're doing car allowances for quite a few people wouldn't it be more appropriate to have them do a mileage report and then get that way we have some traceability of how many miles they're actually using rather than just throwing a number out there because me looking on the outside it looks like it's just a good way to give someone extra money on their salary rather than have a full justification for it there's no traceability to this at all so that's one of the things that i would like to see change unless what you're trying to do is actually give the uh the employee uh more compensation a higher pay and if that's the case well then maybe that's what you should budget for and get away from the mileage or the physical expense yes i have a question about that i mean car allowance if let's say laura uses her car to drive to the bank does she submit a mileage thing i mean this isn't something that they just get as a blank it's like let's say a blank check a car allowance is it i know it's a plant rate it's a flat rate it is it is a flat rate so the mileage is not trapped so is that just an annual thing that the people who the person who uses their car gets 1200 bucks yes it's also considered taxable income so it's technically it's a pay increase that's not really listed as your salary okay and that's why i bring it up is because if i'm questioning it who else is going to question it yes sir two years ago the average finance rate was around to 40 cents a month right now it's over 85 cents a mile so it might be getting we might be getting a bargain but this may also give us a vehicle a vehicle to see if we need to buy a vehicle that or lease a vehicle something that everyone can use rather than just throwing something out that sticks mayor you say that you know this we can certainly change the procedure later as to how we pay employees for their use of their cars but this is just putting money into the budget for whatever whatever way we're going to pay him right i mean and the only reason why i'm bringing this up at all and uh council member shirley is probably doing the same thing is because we have nothing to get to base this these numbers against i know it's small in the grand scheme of things but it's still it's a number that it's jumped out at all of us and maybe we should take a look at we need we need something to start with so that we can know how how to handle the following year and it does bring to the surface those things that is it appropriate to reimburse someone a vehicle expense or or keep track of the mileage we use in the city and i think it's more appropriate and it's down the road in just direction that you know mileage is probably a better way to handle that and it may be that we're paying her more money but she's not getting charged taxes on it it's being handled appropriately i agree so just taking that same concept down professional services is down 80 and the schema thinks it's not a big deal but it's a drastic change so you know when we look year over year we had budgeted 10 000 last year and now we're at 2 000. i mean we're not doing a you know a budget versus actual so i don't know really when we land there but um that one was scheduled to be 10 000 this year and then it was reduced because it was uh more of that placeholder okay so now so have you spent that much this year or do you know and then uh telephone communications is up 22 that seems kind of high for a telephone but i don't you know i don't know digital guys brings you know is there someone new that's got required you know telephone services i don't know we did switch phone systems lane did the phones go up in the buildings yeah when we when we brought in the ipads and everything those expenses went up because you guys have data plans on your ipads so the old phone system uh unfortunately was obsolete and we couldn't get repair parts for it so we had to go out and find them long system and i guess really these other ones are very small but the other the other question i have there is uh library services and um the actual from 2020 to 2021 was 29 000 2900 and we budgeted 6500 year over year is is that 2900 more what the actual number is going to look like in uh 2122 it's like that yes then you know again maybe that's a place we should take that number up you know instead of you know we're more than doubling what we expect it to cost maybe go to halfway yeah okay i have a question on page 40. this is the john deere okay so we're just saving for a new one yes replacement plan this is for grooming and doing groom better shores with this a couple passes do we get compensated for that do we build the shoulders back no not currently then just looking at the truck replacements i don't think we're saving enough money i'm just going to throw that out there it's up for conversation but we think that in the end in 2027 we'll need to buy a new vehicle for twenty eight thousand dollars and i don't think you're gonna get a pickup truck maybe justice um we purchased it off the sheriff's contract so we probably gotta look at it this year when the vehicle is going up and and probably the same thing to the utility truck especially because that bad yeah the prices and that is with our with a trade-in is that [Music] the last i would hate my car or did we just auction lane yeah did we get a trade-in value on the on the 2016 f250 or no actually we get we take it to auction and typically we get more money than trying to trade i don't remember what we got but that truck was uh gosh it was over 10 or 12 years old and i think we got three or four thousand dollars for it and just to clarify the sheriff's contract is you know those numbers in the budget are set up based on the sheriff's contract that we can rebuy a trucking in that range for that price so you know i think the numbers are reasonable that we're saving and you know we just might have to modify the number at some point if we get new you know kyle if you go get next year's contract which will come out probably sometime in september and see if you need to elevate it but typically you can buy a truck for 28 to 40 thousand off the share okay on page 51 and i'm asking this question because i just have heard bits and pieces of it i don't know what's really happening here but i'm talking about the generator we have currently saved 120 thousand dollars and expect to replace it when we have 240 000. did i hear that we're getting a grant for this am i it hasn't been awarded me applied okay so i submitted information back it was probably three three weeks ago we requested a number so i don't know so they received their first application they did i've been providing information at least three back to the state so um and when would that be awarded if you got it i'll check on that um it's kind of hard to get the exact date right you get an idea is it possible that it would be before the year 2023 possible with the way we applied for the grant there was two tiers of money um the way it was put together and thought was that there'd be leftover money to cover our grant afterwards so it kind of had to get through all the first tier awards and see what we end up so it wouldn't be a 100 to being marketed it's 25 75 yes okay that's what we applied for but as it stands right now we're fully budgeted we kept the full budget take care of this next year okay and then on page 52 again just this is just business sort of related but this is bayside park master plan i was told there was no master plan i've seen a master plan my question is do we have a master plan and if so could it be distributed to council so that when we vote on purchasing equipment and so forth we actually know what that plan is or can we get a presentation on what the plan is lynn do you know the last time the plan was updated that plan was done prior to me even being there and this money was set aside to put that actually the 56 640 was set aside to put a gazebo out of the park the 25 was to replace the playground money that you were using this year that you used so realistically i think you can reduce that 10 000 because i understand that the playground came in 15. but i'm sure there's some documents that they submitted because that master plan was probably done 16. and if you remember we did submit a grant for part of that and the console asked for it to be computers that's done are we actually following the master plan or is this the the title just continued to flow ever since the creation of the mastermind the the title continued to flow and the money was you know it's basically set up so if we needed to replace the playground or something we had money to do that but the 50 000 was projected to be a for a gazebo uh right there was a concrete pad because that was something in the future that was planned for that area so it'd be safe to say that we really do need a new master plan for all the parks in the city uh i think your partner brett ford could do a good portion of that the city spent several thousand dollars on that previous master plan and yeah they had a lot of pretty pictures and stuff but it was it was over a million dollars to do it all and that was only for bayside park it wasn't very important this would also be a good time to dust off the planning and zoning boards review of the best uses for parks because they they look at some outside of the blind kind of uses for those things and also it's not just based on you know we have nine pocket parts in the city too and more and more students are starting to recognize the value of those little pocket parts because they're right in the neighborhood people complain about a little place for the kids to play so they play in the streets and there's a park right around the corner they could be going to invite you so the planet and zoning board report might be one of the first places to look and get the planning zoning board so i guess from that conversation we can reduce this budget number to fifteen thousand dollars and um and then get a complaint moving forward what how we how we proceed with some with a master plan for all of our parks this is just way out but it looks like nothing one year then 50 one year and back and forth just bringing the budget up is that right just just to clarify if you submit for grants you have to provide you have to show them that you have money budgeted for these projects or and as an example uh we had to be able to show them in the last grant that we had money button or you lose a lot of points in the grant process can we then market i mean the budget should be marked for us to say that you know asterisks this number is here purely because it's a grand requirement otherwise we would show zero well i guess you could i mean yeah because the question is you're looking at the future and the future has nothing to do with the current budget those numbers are are numbers that you know rather whether it's the park or a storm water project those are numbers that were given to us you know like the engineer gave us numbers for each stormwater project and in the out years those numbers are going to fluctuate and change and if you go after a brand then you may have to change that number but it's not really part of the current year but it's it's a projection for the future that's something we should maybe take a look at because we start looking at capital project burn down there's a done pretty much along the same timeline and it's more just to get a grasp on what the future may hold the potential use of our reserves if i see a major product to come out i'm going to be very reticent to dig into the reserve or you know vice versa i just thought that's not direction okay uh moving on on page 54 again just an observation we've got um accumulated funds for morgan park block milling concrete replacement my question is do the meter self-fund this do we know what the revenue is off of the meters at oregon park and if they don't should we consider increasing the vapor price they need all the meters revenue is in the budget for this well the meters are in the disappointed yes next year i believe 150 150 000 uh there is some expense against that but to your question jody yes if you took that revenue and indirectly you're doing that anyway and here marketing or ordered part of course morgan park is would pay for this probably at one year yeah it would be interesting to see that and if it doesn't you know again my my position on those meters in morgan park because they're not available those spaces are not available to residents our only beach access that we have given away we need to increase the price whenever we can well your your current price right your current revenue for parking outside of the marina i'm talking it's 117 000 and i would venture to say i know kyle you probably just did the report for bayside which is probably the negligible amount to the state but i'm guessing i'll say a hundred thousand dollars of that came from morgan we ever make a couple of spaces available for only residents again did we roll that back no you couldn't i went to the county the county uh came back went to the state i thought but when you analyze it you told me that we had more spaces than we needed and then we could take two spaces back there and i did go to the county with my theory and they told me went to the state came back and said no and there there's an email uh probably in my email file from john bishop stating that but we can give some of the parking spaces at the marina we all live on that side of the gulf boulevard they're not replenishing our sand i think we just pull them out anyway that's another subject for another day but anyway okay golf boulevard beautification we had a lot of questions about this last time we met and i need to know what the answers are do you have oh you don't remember what we were talking about what the actual costs are versus what we have we thought we had [Applause] quite a bit of money saying we're only short about a million dollars or something for short 1 million 277 983 and that was completing the entire project that's completing phase one and phase two entire crossing [Music] million dollars just for purdue so yeah two million for duke and mark gave us one million one hundred sixty four thousand we were we were thinking that long term we would save if we borrowed from the reserves to finish this project and then we incrementally got that money back and put it right back into our reserves is that is that the plan are we considering that now or well like the utility consultants the conduit is going to be locked in that that's locked into 2025. the due costs there was a spike due to the material increase in price and labor i if the material comes down slightly it could change it um but it also could go up i don't have a way of predicting that for sure um that's locked in until december 8th 2022 so it's only 180 days and the updated costs you got that's uh starting on the north side and doing as far as you can is that correct phase two is phase two phase two is north of it's actually north of the causeway yes okay and i know that we discussed possibly switching that around to get more bang for buck because we were doing a longer span of underground did you look into that at all was there a reason why we started with phase one was it just the having the money in the budget yeah it was to face it based on the money we were getting from the county in total the city of miller beach is getting about 3 million we get 1 million for bella shore and that money spread over five years as of this coming budget you will have about 2.2 million as of october 1st and phase one was gonna cost us uh it was a little over a million with the new prices she gave us before i left and mark's price was like 700 and some thousand uh phase two was a little over two million the definitely mark's price for the uh underground was 1.3 for that and then you've got about a hundred i'll say 200 000 per spectrum to do the uh east side of the road in phase two so russell uh phase two was did i hear this right three around three point three three i got three point four one three point four plus another two hundred thousand i got three point four with a 200 okay okay and right now you have about 2.2 this way plus the 802 000 from the american rescue money right if you you've dumped that on the stove projects and take that money it cannot be used for underground right and we put that in stormwater full of money from stormwater well no you're not technically you're just moving the projects right but to show a chain of where it's coming from this is a massive decision you're going to make with this thing and i had an expectation that we were going to do a briefing on all the different permutations of this thing and what the costs were and am i missing something here is that going to be a separate meeting or are you going to try to decide that you know just asking questions so that's all it is just trying to figure out if anything has changed or if points of interest come you know they come to our attention as far as our curiosity we want to know well i mean the expectation was we were going to get some sort of briefing and recommendation sometime during the budget process so when can i guess or foresee getting well um joey is asking questions right now that concern her and uh and then we'll come around to you and you can ask your questions and then we'll we will anything that we've suggested that we don't like about the budget if the council agrees we give back and you can again this is a proposed budget so it's just a conversation about page 55. sorry i have a lot but um i'll do two more so and i'm bringing these up because it's a good time to you know identify these catholic projects and what we need to focus on and you know is there places to save money is it something we need to you know rethink it so on page 56 i'm looking at the walking paths we've talked about this before i ever took my first participation in a meeting in the city council but um we keep talking about this abandoned walking path and immediate started on it and again it's another parks and rec situation but when we're looking at this we're talking about concrete sidewalks i believe i don't know why i think that but is this something could we to kind of expedite it and get this thing moving some just again just for conversation we don't even talk about it just you know as we move forward can this be done in asphalt and could it be could these sections be done when we're paving instead of trying to do every inch of walking path you know in one contract can we just if we're paving the street can we hit that path in between those two streets so that section is done yeah that that is the plan it is asphalt and the plan is you know when like 12th and 13th would be to try to get while they're going out there paving do that section between 13th and 14th yeah no one's ever walked that it's a great path you should did that strategy change initially it was to incorporate it with the street paving in the valley occurred and then there was some issue about it was decided to forget that plan let's just break it out and do it all in a new show did that strategy change the strategy was always to do it with the street products with the stream then we didn't have a conversation yeah what we did we needed to separate put some money aside for it because the stormwater projects did not have money in the stormwater to do those walkways so that's why we created a budget line to put that money in there even though doing it at the same time so how far down is this going to go it goes all the way from the south to the from first right up to another black tough stop today it's blocked which i never really understood how that happened yeah i don't think it was intentional i think it used to be over there is that right we can't find it we don't know we blow we can't see where there was ever easily but we think there was so they intended to blacktop first to 18th street but four foot lines 10 feet now does this also include the walkway that has been requested next to the seawall on what street is that yes i thought we looked into that do you remember i thought we priced that out there was a problem with the tree bridge or something it's the i was told it couldn't be done because of the slope that we'd have to put a retaining you'd have to put a stem wall up so you could get a flat cyclone for ada requirements seems like there's a way to do it or even just a shallow path or something but there's a way to do it but it was hit with resistance well it definitely seems like another another opportunity for improvement but i was just wondering if that i'm not trying to make a decision yeah but um i can't think we entered 10 feet of land from like first street up to we have we have this service it's it is going to be that's going to go right [Music] you go around the corner and all of a sudden there's people out there looking at you like the hell you doing here it's always been there i didn't think it was i'm just just saying this depending on if it was 10 feet wide if it was worth okay last question i promise this is um regarding page 63 the city street lights program i was pleasantly surprised to see you have this much in funds there but again do we have a official program or plan in place and i know we hit on it briefly one night in at work session but i just would like to see what that plan is and you know can we start can we start working the plan sooner rather than later do we have to wait till all the funds are here before we start working the streets that really need light so the plant starts in the south portion of the city and works its way up we identified the poles that could be removed the wood poles that are currently there and we looked into replacing them with concrete poles but then we also looked at the solar lighting and it still stands at doing the south end first with the count of 10 to 15 solar lights and the price per pole we recorded at 4 000 for the solar light itself and then i got a quote for installation at about eight thousand dollars so you're looking at twelve thousand dollars per goal so that would be roughly 120 to 180 eight thousand dollars per pull per solar delivery for install but you get that back over a 10-year period roughly no i'm i'm questioning why would a pad cost eight thousand dollars you're not running the water you know you're not running no condo so you know using pens and more than using yeah i understand that with eight thousand dollars it's just like six hours no no there's there's damage there's damage that gets done and i'm sure that they have liability insurance and things like that and they have to take into consideration whenever they did they did the island there were many mistakes and it's not not that they're being sloppy but they walk around and they survey and because things are so deep in the ground they may be four feet away from where they actually think they are and it happens several times so there's a lot involved in just making sure you get those things in the ground right now i understand that but we've been doing this we call them sniffers i mean today this everything here is so shallow unfortunately the precision of the sniffer stuff as well as the drawings of where this stuff is so these this quote for the the installation is direct barrel for the bolt so it isn't the auger well it isn't the helical anchor it's a direct arrow okay that's all i need that's that sums up my questions are we are we doing some of those this year last i heard i was going to present a plan you know we'd make a decision i saw the 5 increase in salaries and wages good appreciate that um page 24. other contractual services the 2700 increase yeah that's 20 000 um was that the software because i'm really having second thoughts about that software we're doing the budget right now and even when we expense twenty thousand dollars it's usually over two three four five years i mean they want a one-shot 20k purchase yeah that that was for the software and based on the numbers heather was gaining it's probably going to cost more than that if we did anything it's not a very affordable so what's i mean are we saving that much time effort and reporting legality we go into the system that we can't do that we've been doing all the while what are your thoughts on that did you say some kind yeah the thoughts on the financial program um well we put that we were having some issues with uh quickbooks uh i don't know kyle if they've got that rectified if you know we got an initial number from one company but after looking at it their uh 20 000 software program wasn't that great and my last conversation with heather and andy was that they might have the quickbooks situation rectified if that's the case then you don't need to spend it yeah right then we drop that that's the case okay okay that's going to kill um uh okay we already talked about the library cards uh page 29. now this is something that just came in we have the new updated budget from waste management and it matches what the county talked about the solid waste however they've increased that number from 3 30 2 35 to 3 30 9 85. 700 [Music] i met with uh with bill from waste management on friday we we're checking over his paperwork we discovered some errors in the numbers i got in the the papers you just got on friday afternoon so the budget won't reflect the exact number okay yeah we just thought so yeah it's cool the final thing i had on here was a page 69 and that was the interest income again going from 6740. well we're back to the 700 but you know why the the jumps i mean we were undergoing some increases in interest are we ever able to look at this with the other interesting income i did get an overview from heather okay [Applause] this is 69. hey there's also interest income in other areas we had a question what's the placeholder we were looking at interesting wasn't the page that we were questioning before i had ten thousand yes yeah that was the previous question i will go through here besides interesting so um so the number is based on what you've seen in the past years so it is a guess on how much interest we're going to make because we we currently have investments in the marina fund we have a six month term cd that we keep rolling over and that's paying point zero zero one percent it's valued at a hundred and three thousand the big investment we have is an sba fund and that is 96 of the general fund and four percent of the capital has about 3.12 million combined that interest fluctuates so it's been point zero nine percent in october 2021 but it has gotten up to one point two five in june 2022 okay yeah that's about alright unfortunately and then the other interest is is just in our money market accounts which is minimal um bank united and truest you could calculate that but it's examples what was the cd right cd rate right now is .001 percent i mean i see cds advertised right now two and a half percent on time 18 months this is six capital one okay um paige uh this is actually the general fund department of budgets they don't have one here it's about miscellaneous videotaping and monthly meetings in candidates ten thousand dollars a year um mayor yeah okay so that is the videotaping that we do for every council meeting that's the contract with victor that's something we need to consider moving forward because we're doing the zoom i spoke with him and asked him what he thought about administering his new meetings he uh he said that we could propose him a rape but he'd like to he'd like to make the same amount of money he was like that's gonna happen the problem i have with that is that he's here and he's doing all the work here and there's no editing later and i remember editing video and that's what took so long he was putting it all together he had two cameras back there he was trying to dial them in together to make the presentation that he wanted on youtube um we're hitting record and it's it's live it's recorded and that's what's being put on youtube now so if anything i would think that our costs could go down unless he just wasn't being paid anything i don't know exactly what each session cost but i believe it's uh what is it 500 it's like 4.95 and then 95 an hour for any over two hours he gets some time the 4.95 give him set up time and time to do the edit afterwards but if a meeting goes over two hours and not so much likely but previously we had a lot of meetings that went over two hours and i didn't talk to victor before i left and told him that you know we need to come up with another plan now it sounds like kyle has spoke to him and he's not interested in changing his rate so we may need to come up with a different plan so someone can basically monitor the zoo video because i think we're getting the same quality out of it based on what i've seen can we um ask kyle one can you talk to the other cities along the beach see what they do see who their people are and number two can we talk to the attorney to ask him very specifically look we're recording in two different places can we just legally go right to zoom and use that as our record i don't know about storage underneath we can legally go to a monitor we could just do an audio yeah so satisfying another thing is that maybe i i may understand where he's coming from possibly right now there's no one other than lynn lynn is our only participant on sunday however if this takes off and i suspect that eventually it will you're going to see people raising their hands and they're they're going to want to interact and you have to sort of be able to moderate the zoom meetings separately from moderating the actual council meetings and they have to work together so has to be someone who is capable of doing that and it certainly can't be patty because she's busy actually taking minutes and uh our votes and you know yeah with what patty does yeah brings up one good technical point and i think the last meeting is you should really have a monitor right in front of you because you're managing the flow and you can see us on the council you can see somebody coming to the deus but online you kind of need to see you know a hand raised up by the and does it so when the time comes you can recognize at that point you gotta panic because you're doing two two different things you can't be on zoom you can't be doing your notes it might be helpful for the mirror to have something right there a monitor in front of you i think as it stands right now he's probably victor's probably our immediate solution but once we find out exactly what all that encompasses then maybe we look around and see if there's a better solution that's it some of you did a great job going through this thank you so much for your attention to detail this is my fifth time through the budget process and in some regards it is still akin to dogs watching television they know something's going on up here but they're not quite sure but what i'm going to do is just give kind of a breakdown on some of my observations at one time we had talked about best practices a lot of the budget things that appear in your book are accounted for within the stove types of departments or capital improvement projects and that sort of thing at one time i had asked for a breakdown by the dot x x accounting code so that we could look at line items across all the stove pipes what are all the telecommunication costs within each department where all the clerical paper printing clause throughout each department instead of going through each one of these pages i'm kind of finished managing boat docks parking decals and library cards when when lynn reason i sat down to go through the budget i looked at two pages that was it this was the breakdown across the pages by the dot xxx accounts and they were also prioritized by the highest value items to the lowest value items so it was very easy to pick out hey let's talk about the valuable few i don't need to be talking about items that are 0.03 percent of the question i'm more interested in those things that are like 12 18 which is 10 percent completion interestingly we had one initially when this thing was issued way back when in october or whatever and i don't i've seen an updated one in a long time again when i sat down and then raised it was very easy because we were able to sit down and go through this thing and on just the pages for uh uh operating revenues and that sort of thing we were able to just kind of go through very quickly and drawn out what are those things that we can actually control and those things that we can't control and things start falling out very quickly the only things you can control storm water assessments parking meter fees uh slip grounds a lot of that stuff is tactical stuff stormwater might be something we're interested in again what are the valuable few that we need to be concentrated in our time on we just spent a lot of time talking about capital improvement projects and asking questions about it and rather than our our part being part of the review process it should really be a participative process there should be a portion of the budget build that is just capital improvement progress where we spend the day looking at all of the capital projects so that we understand what those projects are what priorities they support within the strategic plan and at the end of the day we all have the same idea these are the projects we're fine and there's no discussion where it gets to this portion of the budget review we've already done it signed off what's next contracts that sort of thing uh watch it budget and brief that's something that i've been asking for for a long time if if we don't have a budget process an overview of the budget in this city that a resident can't pick up and understand intuitively and comprehensively just by looking at maybe two pages this is the money coming in this is money going out these are the projects we're going to do this is money we have to take out of the reserves they've made up for the sure if they can't read that then we're not doing our job and and we have the accounting staff that does most of this stuff we have the city manager doing this stuff we outsource the management of this stuff by the time it gets to our level it should be just a high level of stuff and i would define any of you to sit down and explain his budgeting process to me in five years that has been through more than i have can you sit down and explain his budget process in five minutes to me 000 foot view on this thing is i said manage the valuable few 80 20 rules make the capital improvement project participative we all sit down we all prioritize them and it needs to be an easily explained process with more detail that's going to pick up we shouldn't have to go through the tokyo phone book here and figure out line items on each individual page you should have one page you can look across and say why is that number so high in that department and all the other numbers are so low and again it's not to mix stuff it's to understand why it is or at least somebody has to explain and that's accountability my first year on the council we did this and i remember i said why are we micromanaging personnel why are we micromanaging postage stamps envelopes why are we doing this this is the city manager's job to get a budget and let it work within it um i mean a good one is uh is the uh automobile allowances i had no clue what that total number is i mean i figured out in one or two of the accounts but i don't know what the total line bottom line is right and i don't know who's getting it or why or how where is he kind of doing yeah actually that's uh too right exactly um are you uh are you finished okay we've covered most of the things that uh that i had flagged uh but i did have a question about insurance insurance is just thrown out like crazy but it's not going out like crazy in the budget why is that health insurance it just looks like uh yeah a total of uh 1.6 percent how is that even possible we get quoted yearly is this this this is before the quote though is that right okay how we've always done the health insurance to try to maintain it at the level that's budgeted for we look at the plans every year and if they we ask the health insurance company to give us options as an example and you could probably recollect uh two three years ago we changed plans because the plan they had at the time was went out and drastically so that's how we adjusted to maintain we adjust you know the plan to somewhat maybe the copays go up maybe the you know something else changes as far as you know the different allowances that are set up but that's how we've managed it and unfortunately we've tried to go to uh like a group insurance with possibly some other cities and we been able to do that and right now you've got four employees on the health insurance i think and that's pretty much it's based on the age of the employee so we've been able to maintain it by adjusting the health insurance plan i'm curious what the the rise is percentage-wise for the employee [Music] we did a survey on that i want to say three or so years ago [Music] and pretty much every city pays for the employee uh at one time we had one employee that he paid i think it was 25 of the family but he was the last person when he left when he retired he we also have property insurance though correct i mean right but that that's a that's with the floor missible insurance trust i'm gonna get back up for one second you know i talked about my two pages interestingly operating costs are broken out very well operating revenues have broken out very well but again the valuable few interestingly we talked about the cost of personnel services we talked about each of the fire transfers personal services one line item one line item there and if you look at the breakdown of salaries and wages salaries and wages is just one line item right right but depending on who you're looking at and how it's broken down you have another seven to eleven line items that feed into that number and those are some of the numbers that would be interesting to look at and the same thing i mean you go on interest fund transfers that's one of those smoke and mirror things that i've never really ever got my my arms around i mean lynn reeds has it well adjusted on this game but uh and many times i've sat down for them to try and get it then it seems like it changes every time capital expenditures that's only five minutes again it's one of our largest expenses there and again it's i think we need to spend more time being more participating in some of these areas that's why that's why other municipalities and counties and state governments they have they assign people to specific committees and that's how things get done and that way at least you always have one person on the council who knows exactly everything that goes on within that one particular section of the local government and that's one thing that we don't have we typically are not involved with parks and rec you know planning zoning budgeting we can certainly do that but there's also a little bit of gray area as to what what would the attorneys recommend and many will challenge and say that if you're attending these meetings you're you're just your presence alone could be um you could be accused of influencing that that community for that so there has to be some way that we can participate without possibly jeopardizing ourselves or people on these committees i'm a big proponent of benchmarking every just about every municipality around here has a website and if you go into their website you can get into their budget and one of the things you will typically see is something similar to a budget in brief it's just a two three four level page document targeting the residue saying this is how the budget works this is where the big pots of money are this is what we're financing this is where your money's going so you're saying like capital improvements just do a line item number what's spent and if the citizen wants to get into it they need to tilt is that what you're saying well no i i don't think you want to be that deep into the capital plan but i would say that where you're 80 of your expenditure is going to be for that year is only a handful of projects at least be able to explain why i understand what i'm saying is do you want to set a number and then the next page if you want to get into the particulars then you see everything else it's how it's being spent there's a million dollars but there might be 10 items at 100 000 a piece the way i'm reading it it should be like a two-page thing you should be a hundred percent um because i couldn't explain a bunch of plugins maybe five days but that's what i'm trying to find out where you're going with that i can say maybe have a discussion later but maybe for now going to the largo has a great point you get worried clear water and maybe all the one and prince of mind will all distribute them or something but i mean just to give us an idea you know you should be able to explain it to your high school kid right there just just a comment we do but or did put on the quarterly basis of the budget debrief for the previous quarter so that that information should be on the website and it basically shows the expenses and it shows the revenues that have come in based on the budget so you know i know largo and clearwater and all them but they've got a much larger staff than the city of miller beach has so there are some limitations on what you've been creating no i agree but it's just not simply a pie chart of this i think you need to go a little bit further and just provide a little more information and i'll i will search one out that i think is a clever representation of what i'm trying to get across here and bring it in as an example okay did they not get the updated [Music] top to bottom for revenue yeah that's right in front of us okay yeah that came out with the agenda okay are you talking about this yes i have to use a magnifier [Music] is [Music] is any other questions or suggestions for this go round no sir we have three citizens back there with anyone like to speak no well you have uh a small list of changes um it wasn't anything huge most of those questions correct yes i made notes on everything and get it changed okay have a question for the action item regarding how to proceed with the gulf of water underground where we go over there we need to have we need to include that in a word session what i'm trying to do is get us past this budget meeting the tentative military meeting and the city manager interview meeting and then we will consider having a work session i'm trying not to kill everyone so that being said um mr ripler would you mind emailing out the changes that you will be making what pages they're located on and then that way if anything is left out that we've discussed everyone read it and look it over and then send him an email back if anything was left out just kind of a recap in this non-budget related just as a follow-up to some of the questions in the last meeting i had a really um i came across this code enforcement report that was put together and give it to me a couple years ago thought it would be something lower puts together a flow chart and some good information i'll share with patti and see if she can distribute it just her further insight and then i also looked at some old agendas and two points that were made about it would be nice to have like here's the background here's what we need to work on this is why it's being presented to you and that sort of thing these were actually all prepared by patty but they were these are great how they used to present things in the agenda packet so i'll steal a great format great format very informative yes and then this was one of laura's older reports that was pretty intense and a lot of action so i remember whenever the code changed maybe two or three years ago we sent out a nice pamphlet i know that it's still available online maybe it's i'm leaving in the morning there are still out there might not be a bad idea to consider recirculating those again getting them out to the residents because i think some people have forgotten what's important to the city and what our city code actually is just something to think about we'll bring up the work session other than that i think it's time to adjourn this meeting so i have a motion so moved second frank baker joey shirley all in favor aye any opposed gotta get bullied out there this meeting is adjourned"
