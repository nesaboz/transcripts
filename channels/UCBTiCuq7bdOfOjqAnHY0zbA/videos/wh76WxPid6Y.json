have a copy of that sir no sir I don't know who was supposed to be here tonight all right let's uh I'd like to make a note of that it's uh this is not the first time this has happened why don't we just move right on over them to the monthly code enforcement report and thank you David laughter for being here tonight yes sir thank you Commissioners mayor City officials and residents Steve clackett for the record as you see in front of you the monthly report from code enforcement you'll notice that our weed and grass and overgrowth has raised a little bit but we are taking care of that and our unpermanented work has dropped happy to see that it's down to 7.5 out of percent out of the circle there I've been doing a lot of follow-up working with a lot of the residents on the overgrowth of weeds and obstructions on the roadways I've been in contact with the city manager also and getting guidance direction to help go along with that we still have a few problems along Gulf Boulevard that we are working with but it's due to the Duke Energy contract trying to get the underground utilities other than that that's it for my report I'll stand for any questions Council we have any questions from the deputy yep thank you very much thank you have a great evening yeah you too um while we are discussing uh the police of the police report I do have a question for the city manager do you look do you know what the current procedure is for parking and fishing this is where I'm going what I've noticed is that suddenly the bridges and the shoreline anywhere where there's not homes has become free fishing and I have yet to see anyone Patrol and do anything about it I've I've actually rolled down my window and said hey you might want to might want to reconsider doing that because they do patrol around here and you can look an hour later and they're not leaving Mr verify the address that on the 4th I was out I did catch several people uh out on the bridges they were parked and told them they could be there can't park there one of them was up on Harrison we had to move over to the marina as far as Park fishing off the bridge there's not really much we can do about that because it's considered open Waters but if if somebody parks on the roadway I get an opportunity to move if they don't we're going to cite them and move them anyway this one individual that was parked on Harrison went to the marina didn't pay ended up getting a 55 fine anyway so um but I am I am monitoring any type of street parking like that for anybody who is not doing any type of work in the residential areas okay and just for clarification I don't have a problem someone fishing off the bridge it's the parking at the entry or exit sign yes sir and it's happening constantly I'm wondering if you see it in your neighborhood also we see it still on Harrison but I know I know someone who got tickets for doing that so they were parked at Laura what the Inland Park areas but you know where they could park on they could fish off the pier and they were part there and they got tickets so I know that the sheriff is doing their job when it comes to that um but you know along with that I picked up a bunch of beer cans on Harrison because I'm sure they were standing there drinking a beer and fishing and so yes it's a you know it's an issue but and also at Bayside Park too I've been writing a lot of citations out there for the same thing where they're just pulling in there not paying and then going out and fishing along the coast here all right and um if we see that is there a better number than they permanently on the whole phone line that we can call um what I can do is I will get uh Joe and David's cell phone numbers so we can we call them directly okay because they they do not mind having that happen and they just out code on it when it does happen same thing I've been giving out my cell phone number so if there is an issue I will go check on it but I will address this with Sergeant stiver to make sure that we get it up the line to make sure that this is taken care of I appreciate it thank you very much yes sir any other questions or comments no all right let's move right on to item number four uh is Chief Davidson here tonight to present for the vanilla Suncoast fire and arrest rescue District all right we will participate right on the item number five a presentation before I call Mr Davis to the podium it's important to know why he is receiving this award since 2000 and possibly earlier Rudy has served Belair beach in various capacities including serving on the steering committee that made recommendations to the council to replace our aging City Hall he served on the citizens advisory committee it worked closely with Pinellas County to agree on the design for the Bel Air Causeway Bridge he served as president of the Bel Air Beach resident group that form a pack and brought the council manager form of government to referendum he served as the first mayor of Bellaire beach in the new Council manager form of government during that term that the council elected to move forward with the construction of our community center he served as a member of the board of adjustments he served on not one but two city manager search committees he also served as Vice chair of the Planning and Zoning Board I could keep going but I'm pretty sure that everyone here gets my point now I'd like Rudy Davis to join me at the podium Mr Davis on behalf of the city of Baylor Beach I am honored privilege to give you this distinguished service report to earned it and we are very proud of all your accomplishments and we're truly grateful for everything you've done thank you very much thank you [Applause] foreign it has been my pleasure and privilege over the years to work with so many dedicated residents to share my love with this community and the desire for that they maintain the unique character and lifestyle that we enjoy while working on various committees boards and special projects over the years some of the most satisfying or compliments accomplishments have been serving as the president of other Beach residence group is one word for all the cultural manager form of government referendum and subsequent approval by the voters of our city serving as mayor during the transition into Mr profession that's more professional affordable government than continues to serve us well today and most recently to help organize the campaign to defeat the mayor who would be king thank you I've always felt like the 73 years of Bel-Air Beach telephone members before me that service to our city was fully compensated for by the opportunity to maintain and protect what we have within the slope of an amazing community and I never wanted a salary equipment work to me if I were here for the money I was here for the wrong reason as I leave behind public service to attend other matters of require medical attention I do want to alert our residence through what our city council already knows there's a serious challenge to Bellaire Beach and all cities in Florida by the current Florida legislature in Tallahassee they want to end whole room that was mandated by Florida voters in a 1968 referendum their objective is to take away a local municipalities ability to control what happens within its own ordinance and take that power to Tallahassee so they can serve the money special interest who don't want you and me telling them what they can't do in our account our own labeled local state center periodic disabled was the sponsor of the bill that would take away our grandfathered right to live in short-term rentals and our local state representative Ken Berkeley oppoted and supported that measure in the house we need to press them to either change their views and support home rule or face removal from office by local voters who put them there mayor and Council should keep a very proactive stance to retain your Authority in local matters and a resident support their support their evidence to do so where Tallahassee will soon take that life away from us we should all actively support the local the local voices United project sponsored by the Florida League of cities I asked Council to make sure every resident is aware of the project and how it sort of supports our right to self-determination mayor council City staff I thank you again for this recognition I wish you and all the new residents from Belair Beach the very best thank you [Applause] thank you [Applause] all right we are on to item number six which is quarterly board reports let's begin with the board of adjustments report for Mr Mike Kelly Mr Kelly you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor I appreciate the opportunity to tell you that the board of adjustment has been busy I want to adjustment normally only sees two or three variances a year we've had two this quarter and we were supposed to have one this Thursday but we posted on it so we have an active board we've had the same three kind of cases that have come before us regarding pools um Kyle's already got a plan to make that get reviewed and I'm sure everything will work out just fine but um we've got again an active board we're getting a lot of experience for the new members and if there's any questions I'll be glad to handle at this time hey Mr Kelly do we have any questions or comments I think you guys are doing a great job and I'm hoping we can get this absolutely so thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen all right now we are on to the citizens advisory committee report from Mr Ron saganigan thank you mayor and Council uh citizens advisory committee Memphis uh past quarter under our other title as the audit committee and we approve the final comprehensive annual financial report uh on May 3rd and it was approved as the council approvement and a fixed Mayors and filled all the reports in that we're missing so I will be meeting later this week to review the budget and that's what we've been up to this morning thank you do we have any questions or comments no thank you again all right next up is the Park and Recreation report from again um just a couple things from the park and rec board once again I'd like to thank all of our beach cleanup volunteers over the last quarter we are looking at new items to put Beller Beach logo on I like the table class by the way um so if anybody has any suggestions please contact anyone on the park and rec board or please call the city We are continuing our new welcome bag program for new residents along with all the necessary information that they need as new residents um they also we also include some Bella reach goodies and some local Merchant info if you as a resident own a local business and like to contribute something to the bag please drop off at the city hall in batches of 10. please see City website or our e-sign for upcoming fall and spring events our third annual health and wellness fair is in January and we would love to have more resident participation as vendors if you're in the health and wellness field so thank you do you have any if you have any questions for me questions yes Mr Baker uh the last Beach cleanup there was a couple residents that raise the issue of Raving the beach more often and I know you were traveling the last month with me and I did bring it up and Kyle was going to look into it it's not much speech to rake anymore but um I think we're working on it yeah that's great I don't I know like there's a schedule that the city maintenance team has to to rank the beach are you looking for the park and rec to maybe get volunteers to do that I'll I'll volunteer but I don't know about the limiting you know somebody getting hurt or you know I'll drive a tractor no I did I did contact the fdep and had an auto permit and they said that we can really get more frequently and we just have to be cognizant of the turtle season you know and sometimes you know during a busy season we by the time the turtles are clear on the beach to get people out there so we kind of can't get it all but you get around them best you can but we can I'm not sure what our goal is on how many how frequently we'd like to do it um but we can do more okay is there limitations for volunteers to be you know I know when you rate you got to dump it and then you have to have I guess a dump truck to take away the waste he said can we put residents in those pieces of equipment I don't think we can we might be at my personal connection you know that's what I thought it to me it seems like it would be difficult because we don't always know when the beach needs to be raped just based on when there's like something like a big blob of goop coming in out of the water so like you know I know it's scheduled but if I don't know we can have maybe something not on call but like that we could do through the city without trying to get groups of volunteers because we can't always do that on short notice anyway and we have to sign a waiver to even participate in between a handle piece of Hardware but uh this reefer we used to do this regularly I don't think it was on a regular schedule but I think it was more of an on-demand why did we stop um the last two times we did it when the wings were accumulating on the beach since I've been here since 18 uh our permit's been filled out for triangulating and after major storms so um you typically what happens is a residents will report a high volume receipt at that final schedule for the any other questions or comments no thank you thanks all right and finally we have the Planning and Zoning report from Mr jcm Bill Mr Mayor vice mayor council members 3221 hibiscus Drive East is representative the zoning board has met several times since the first of the year it's not a board that just sits and looks around sometimes we look around and wonder oh why we got certain things but we got the comp plan and just as a for instance we spent four meetings on account plan and return it to the council and total of five hours two two one and one and this is times that the citizens to vote and we presented that back to the Sea and recently we were presented an ordinance considering signs and it's only this thick and when you go through this I'm wondering whether it belongs with his owning board because most of it I haven't three college degrees but one of them isn't law and most of these presentations early colleagues and we're not attorneys and I would like to ask the council to reconsider putting us towards the board from our consideration because when it was first reviewed by us there were a ton of questions some I know the answers to but the the neophytes on the board did not understand a lot of the verbiage so I don't believe that belongs with our Lord it was referred back to the attorneys and we proceed from there I'd like to thank Patty for helping us out going attention and the city manager is always there and Randy and we're a silent board but we do get our job done and we know that the city and all you people do a good job too and the people behind me that show up they do a big job and I'm also celebrities and they didn't die but they might as well Rudy ran away from me this year 's role in on the right side of me we have been on boards together for the last 28 years and then another person resigned we got new ones they are not familiar but we keep trucking alone you'll get our reports but some of these things should be reviewed before they're dumped on us are there any questions in any of you lovely people have I uh I would like to make a comment first and I think that there was probably a little bit of miscommunication what we were looking for from Planning and Zoning we certainly hope I'm speaking for the entire Council we're certainly we weren't looking for legal advice and unfortunately I'm afraid that that's what was interpreted whenever it made made its way to Planning and Zoning we received numbers that were highlighted and uh it was it was our job to kind of look through it and make some recommendations pitch into planning and zoning and see if you agree you and your the other members agreed I I don't know how we went down this rabbit hole but that I don't think that's what we were looking for I do appreciate your effort and your time and I I apologize on behalf of the council for the miscommunication I think maybe the next time we pitch something to any one of the these uh Overture committees we need to make sure that it's clear and fully understood as what we expect would any council member like to make a comment on what I just said control I sympathize with you with that sign order so I was hoping Council would throw in the trash I think we went from six six items to 40 pages in that new signed ordinance um Justice Kagan I don't want to miss quarter but she says this will come back to court one day all right when they because he got some alarms from residents but I think the Old Law uh the old city manager handled it Mars a beautiful Whenever there was a problem this man right here I think has the same ability to handle it I think we should trash it but I sympathize with the whole board and even addressing it thank you very much I am I'm not going to waste Mr trash time to try to explain why as things have changed over time that we have to become more uh protective of our liabilities and I think that that was the original reasoning for even altering our signed policy all the way around uh again on behalf of the council I apologize for apologies not necessary it's just a matter of communications everything's accepted you have your job we have ours and I appreciate it I I do have a question for you now that we know what the actual task is does planning is only have enough energy to review a copy that has the numbers that we that we inserted showing distances thicknesses Heights of it's not it's not terrible but I always feel like a second opinion on it I understand I'm looking for a yes or no I can quite understand the question you don't I would like to I would like to pitch it back to you again but this time highlighted every number where it's feet inches so that you have something tangible to look at instead of Legally speaking if it's shorter than 45 pages it will be 45 pages but all you have to do is look for the yellow where it's highlighted yellow it should be pretty straightforward and if we put little marks on the side saying something that needs translations I think we can handle that we were another group of citizens absolutely so that we can say that the council did not dictate shape size height width weight Etc that's what I tried to say regardless of what we came up with half well more than half 95 of this was basketball in the legislature in Tallahassee so we couldn't do anything about her if it wanted to correct and so anything that could not yes mayor will will serve okay I'll take care of it thank you so much Mr ambelt I appreciate you call me JC everybody else does any other questions or comments for JC no thank you so much for your report thanks have a good night all right and Mr Reef where would you track down that copy that's got the highlighting on it and make sure that they get a copy of it yes what I gathered from the meeting was um amount of pages the language they felt that it was a tough to understand I mean we were worried that the average resident trying to follow the code wouldn't understand the code so it was left for Mr Mora to try to streamline it to make it easier to understand okay is he working on that Nails yes so when everything happens it needs to come back to us first right okay thank you very much all right now we are on to number seven the City attorney report Palm Trask of trash Daniel is filling in for Mr Moore tonight Mr Trask you have the glory thank you I did speak to Randy he said that although he has been talking to you about the adoption Senate Bill 170 if you just wanted me to let you know that he will be working on ordinances preparing ordinances and direct response to that bill which has now become law that was the only update he wanted me to give you tonight all right okay thank you very much any questions for trash all right thank you very much now we are on to number eight the city manager's report Mr riesler you haven't said Thank You mayor let's start off with the underground project we actually started construction phase today for the conduit going on the ground on phase one and as a reminder that's from 28th Avenue south southern jurisdiction of the city up to Causeway Boulevard and moving on the utility Consultants of Florida are working on the acquiring the easements and the final design for phase two the stormwater projects we are currently on about half the streets surveyed they're coming in as they're coming to Gemini engineering they're being designed and um Georgia a ship and Associates is planning on their finishing up the surveys so in a matter of seconds personal policy manual continue to work on this received the City attorney comments back from Mr asherfeld he provided a lot of insight added a lot to our personal policy manual that was missing bring it up to a good legal status and we did a little history looking into some of the ordinance that were referenced in the previous documents and it's been in the past with personal policy that the city has passed it by ordinance so in order to make our revision legal we need to pass an ordinance which I have Mr Moore drafting at this point hopefully uh in August we'll do our first reading and that what that'll do is it will uh sort of supersede all the previous ordinances and allow us to whenever we amend the policy manual to amend my resolution with the council which is the way they do it um I would like to bring up that uh in our budget Workshop we discussed future savings for a City Patrol vote for uh code enforcement from the water something has come up this past week where some of our Waterway markers were already experiencing issues within Clearwater Harbor another uh good news this week the the ongoing Code Enforcement issue with the tree I have a scheduled to meet with an arborist I got permission from the property owner to go on the private property sterile analysis of that tree we can make it and then I'd like to come back up to the top project which is our 2023-24 budget we have our next budget Workshop coming up on July 17th after that we will adopt the tentative military tonight in our last budget Workshop we we said that tonight we would make a decision on the waste collection services on whether we are like renegotiate with Waste Management roles our current contract that is expiring the end of September or if we're going to advertise RFP for those Services over the weekend I provided you with some documents of some information that was gathered in the past a week and a half or so um first document kind of laid out the price increases the rate increases that we've experienced in our current contract uh also provided a a document from Waste Management that summarized all the cost increases in the different areas of their Waste Management business there was a document on the recent Florida Municipal bid results across the State of Florida from 2019 to this current year I'm showing you know the different contracts that went out to RFP and were awarded who they are awarded to what the percentage of increase was per per municipality that went out to RFP and this this the percentage of an increase Compares their services directly to their previous contracts so as you know every city is different and the contracts are different so the best way to compare is that apples and apples and lastly I prepared I did a lot of research on working with the county on our our Utility Billing how it's set up how it's built through the multi-family dumpsters versus multi-family cans and single family residents I tried the layout uh where we're currently at our bi-monthly billing that is in the utility bill with all the other County utilities and how that covers our revenue from that how that covers our current contract and then what we were looking at as far as a rate increase for a future contract that the proposed or the estimated I should say increase of 25 percent that's all I have I just wanted to leave and have that decision marker all right council do you have any questions for the city manager yes Mr Roberts so excuse me so Kyle so with regards to the waste management contract situation if the city wants to go out to and use a request for proposal do you need a decision on that tonight is that what I'm hearing it would be preferable or the last time we did an RFP uh was it was advertised on June 22nd of the contract year expiring and they received the bids on July 24th so we're a little bit behind that schedule I was told by Mr Moore that our RFP schedules is aggressive per um what he experiences in other cities but I do think it's doable we've done in the past um so I've proposed that if we do RFP we can advertise by July 26th and receive the bids on August 29th leaving enough time to bring it to the September regular meeting okay so is that something we need to to vote on I make a motion and we put an RFP out you don't have to all we're doing is looking for the suppose I mean we have to leave waste management and and it would be time before we before we do that I just have one question what was your thoughts on the data okay you look at all of the data how did you feel about the price increase when I compared it to the other you just validates cities counties that went out to RFP the data shows that the awarded contracts are coming back higher than the proposed estimated renegotiated rate release management my biggest concern is that we go out to RFP and we side that we want to Circle back to waste management but at that point we're actually paying more for the same services fair enough what I'd like to hear out of your mouth what your recommendation is to do tonight The American Nation based on the numbers figures speaking with other municipalities and also speaking of municipalities who aren't satisfied with their service after they changed would be the sticker Waste Management through looking at the history of the services to our residents we've been with them for a long time and I know there's a very positive relationship with our residents I rarely hear any problem if there is a problem Waste Management response immediately and addresses the problem so in my my time is management even in my previous position I've been very satisfied I always imagine Mr Baker after hearing his comments about this are you still in the mood to make a motion for an RFP well I don't think an orfp is going to hurt like putting it out for a bit so the Council of us will want to council wants to stick with a higher rate uh we didn't come back with any removal of those couple holidays if they ever come back with it they did um it was going to make minimal difference to remove the holidays and go down to a long time per week um I just would like to make the point that in my meetings with Waste Management if they renegotiate they estimate 25 increase what they're saying is if we go out to RFP they are based on the numbers they believe we're going to come back higher even with our lowest bidder um the last time we did an RFP the lowest bidder was 13 we specialize 13 more than the lowest bid we ended up going with Waste Management after doing the reviews of the scoring process again I would just looking at all the I feel based on the time we've had Waste Management in my experience with them and hearing the feedback from the residence I I don't believe that the numbers are going to come back I know that waste management is saying that they're going to be higher when they come into bid then when they're going to renegotiate at you know like I said um all other cities that have changed their services and they weren't happy with the until the lowest bidder is always an answer so that's why I recommend that all right so it sounds like we are down to the wire on making a decision but I don't believe we can vote on this because it wasn't on the agenda for tonight am I correct you can vote on this tonight Canada yes okay so would anyone else can make a motion to move forward to approve this this contract rate increase well that's going to come back to you this is just do you want to go out to RFP or not the negotiated contract will come back for approval okay well that's what I'm saying is if we have to approve that's a whole month from now or we have to do it in a special meeting so that contract will come back to you after your next great intermediate if it's if it's been properly prepared yes they want us to commit to renegotiation to start the process um decision too go with an RFP or actually start a negotiation okay so if anyone would like to do a new RFP uh I'll need a motion otherwise another question we're locked into the rating proposals right you know we're not we're not allowed to do that where he came out and said this will be the rate for the next year so the projective rate is we're looking at a 25 increase down they're going to draw up a contract that's been delayed probably very similar to what we have now I think what Mr riefler is saying and correct me if I'm wrong is that if this goes down the RFP they have to get in on it also and we may not necessarily get the same rate back that is precisely than what they're taught me Council comments is this something that we would need or ask or comments from the citizens well we're not voting on anything okay yeah yes so so I appreciate very much the position that Kyle is in here's what I have difficulty with first of all when the current vendor made the comment that we're willing to negotiate a certain percentage increase which we think is very good that they're saying however if we go out and we ask for a request for a proposal they're sort of threatening for lack of a better term that when they give their proposal number it's probably not going to be as good as a negotiated number that sounds very odd to me first of all secondly when we're dealing with taxpayers dollars and we don't know we have no clue what the other competitors may be big through their proposal and anytime I could have been involved with a government organization I spoke with Colin as every organization has some minimum amount of money that they're going to spend it has to go to the request from bid or request for proposal that exceeds that number which is a good thing now a child pointed out to me that actually there's verb is in the current contract and we have Waste Management that says we have the option of renegotiating with them without going out to another RFP again I don't support that only because of the unknown is and what we may be hit with if we do it the other way another company probably will come forward and say Hey you know if you're going out to proposal I'm confident I would have beat that number and then we're sitting in a very uncomfortable position with the way that we spend taxpayers dollars so that's what I'm uncomfortable about without lowering that route I can't imagine another company like Waste Management saying well we would negotiate with you with a number of X but if you go out with a request for a proposal where our number is going to be X Plus that makes no sense to me thank you for that comment other comments well the only other thing is the number that Waste Management through outdoors is a public education and dealing with contractors all my life anyone who's going to bid this job is going to look at that number and say I can beat it where am I going to put it in um I'm not saying Waste Management isn't going to come back up the rate or whatever attractions of dirty I have no problem with Waste Management they do an excellent job and I just think um they're a little bit high on the cost that maybe haven't last year if you remember they came back and said well fuel is up to five dollars a gallon it messes up it labors up they're labor and their labor costs have bottomed out this past year fuels down the 450 a gallon for diesel if you go from six and where do we get 25 increase so that's that's the problems I've had well I guess what we need we need to find out if we have a consensus on this at all so what I would just like to hear is from each council member of what they think which one they refer to move forward with the uh the proposed contract or to do an RFP and start over I really appreciate Kyle's Vision on this and where you're leaving us to go and I appreciate everything that you do and that work the way they what you've recommended you you believe wholeheartedly that we should do however Frank and Floyd have a very good no business goes without getting a request for proposal and I love Waste Management I love what they've done for the citizens they're great they bend over backwards for us but I think doing our due diligence for the citizens have been seen before we get our advice appointment with the others Mr Baker vice mayor Cheryl I think we should um Mr Sables concur go out for the RFP Mr Roberts RV material in this case I am in the minority and I agree with Mr riefler also but the council is pretty much said their feelings and I think we need a motion to go to an RFP motion from their Oracle second motion made by Frank Baker so it's seconded by Mike Sable Mr Banker do you have it for I think we should just see the competitive bidding hopefully it doesn't come back and bite us I mean I don't think it will but that's all I have to say all right we made a motion uh on the Fly I'm going to ask today comments from this citizens now what do you mean citizens like to make a comment yes sir Mr answer John Hanson 22nd Street I was here for that Workshop I was one of the fewest whole person here when you discuss this contract and I listened to the waste management guy my question would be are we at the end of the current contract typically when we do these contracts they're multi-year contracts and within those contracts it stipulates a maximum cost increase am I correction it stimulates a maximum cost increase of four percent based on the cost index in the past two years if you look at the layout of the CPI increases they've asked for more due to the inflation or prices right and just so that you also the the original agreement that was prepared specifically was for a set term until September 30th 2023 so the term is up so we're not going to be able to bind over Waste Management on a specific dollar amount because the term of the contract has expired that the contract also provides as the city manager has mentioned uh you know just read the language for you the city May indicate the desire to renew the agreement for an additional term the term is 60 months upon giving the contractor 30 days prior written notice in the attempt to renew renewals shall be by mutual agreement in such event this agreement may be renewed under the same terms and conditions including the payment adjustments as set forth in section 9. section 9 shows the dollar amounts and then all the subparagraphs saying these are the reasons why we can increase it like the CPI the gas and those types of things okay I'm watching completely clear on whether we were at the end of the current contract or not so okay um the other thing is as I recall from the budget workshop on this topic the consensus then was you were going to lean towards leaving that door open but consider seriously rfps so I think you're going the right direction take a chance but I can't see what this gentleman was trying to justify 25 that's Way Beyond what I think it's reasonable that's my opinion thank you Mr Hansen for any other citizens like to comment on this topic all right back to the council so this is the motion to do an RFP or Waste Services I guess we can just do it all in favor all in favor any opposed all right so we have one opposed I went the other way to be with the group and the closer was Leslie Navarro anything else Mr Rachel that is all get on it okay I did have one more question for you which was um the boat what how much money are you uh proposing to spend for a vote um right now I found a government contract for a patrol boat he has a lot of options on it it's for shallow water and it's good until 2020 I believe it was so it bought us some time on the purchase but I I budgeted a hundred thousand I know that's that's high I know we can uh negotiate if we if we decide on the exact uh model that we want and then go out to our people and get it lower with less options one thing I did not want to do is giving you spell I think that we need something that's that's new and you know in good condition and a hundred thousand dollars today is not much about um let me ask you this if you got your vote would it keep you from jumping in the water again I can't say that 100 all right any other questions or comments from this briefly I guess Mr Roberts Kyle um back to the Stormborn Improvement context which is wonderful that we're moving forward with all of the balance of the of the streets my question to you is I know we discussed once before you had actually offered then the engineering firm at some point would come forward either via Workshop which is probably more clickable or a council meeting what would you kind of visualizing how that was going to work are they going to be more on the front end or after they get weighted the design what do you think would work best I was envisioning and it will be kind of have laid out in our our schedule is once they get to about 90 design um I've been looking at all different options and coming and adjusting the council and that's still on the table perfect which is perfect thank you any other questions or comments to the state manager no all right so now we are on to item number nine uh this is the city clerk report it's Gentry um no report this month mayor a report any questions all right now we are on to the consent agenda items 10 through 14. this is for approval of the April 17 2023 city council work session

Air Beach since January 2020 but you've lived here for a month um can you explain that yeah it must be a mistake on my part I'm not sure on the application that was part of that registration today the voter registration date oh I probably was thinking about just being in Florida we moved in I think it was December November December of 19. so that's probably what I was thinking was in general okay

prepared to read the summary so this is resolution 2023-04 resolution the city council of Bellaire Beach Florida approving the fiscal year 2023-2024 non-ablorm assessment role for the Philadelphia State's Island assessment area directing certification of the assessment rules of Pinellas County Tax Collector and providing for an effective date that was a reading of your resolution 2023-04 by title I thank you very much Mr Trask Mr riesler I'm assuming that you you put this on the agenda and had it generated is that correct that's correct all right would you like to explain the need for this resolution so uh with the assessment this is a requirement that we do every year we recertify it and we do it typically in July every year for what we've already had 15 more years uh it's that sounds correct I don't say 15 and um basically what happens is so she hit for Prague it goes through the three different loans uh make sure that everyone who paid off it's removed and then checks the interest rates and we recertify it we submit it to the property appraiser to get a bill all right thank you before we move forward with any citizen like to comment on this proposed resolution comments all right Council I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution motion made by Leslie material do I have a second seconded by Jody Shirley Mr Tara you have the floor thank you any uh other comments on this resolution that was pretty much just standard housekeeping over here in that case this is to approve resolution 2023-04 Miss Gentry would you please call the roll council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro council member Roberts council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor Gaddis es you have very much [Music] all right we are all to item number 17. this is for authorization for the city managers to execute a contract for law enforcement services for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department for fiscal year 2023 through 24. city manager reflection thank you mayor this is the law enforcement contract typically in the previous years we've had law enforcement on its own contract and the code enforcement on another contract this year when the new contract was drafted it was made clear by the sheriff's office that um it's unusual that we have two contracts and has to files we'll consider going 2-1 contract and they said the terms of the contractor would be the same essentially um just combined and leaving our code enforcement Services as a as needed basis which it which it has been in the past so the new proposed contract for the amount for the law enforcement Services is the 592 716. that is an increase of 7.94 from last year's and then the code enforcement is built on a per hour basis and it increased to 55.66 per hour which is a 7.5 percent increase uh there's a little history the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office has done our law enforcement since 2007 when we disbanded the police department and the code enforcement Services we've used as sheriff's deputy to assist since 2020. from the beginning of code enforces and being done by Pinellas County we use them at a 20-hour program per week rate last year we decided during our budget meetings that we would drop it down to 15 hours per week in Seattle man um that's going well in my opinion and I propose that uh this current budget Erb uh starting October 1 we utilized 12 hours of code enforcement for a week supplementing with in-house staff and this contract has been reviewed by the City attorney and it's provided thank you Mr rieckler before we moved to the council I need to go to Citizens for comments with any citizen I'd like to make yes his Transit John Hanson 22nd Street it's interesting the manual increases year over year get higher and higher this is close to three percent more of the last this current fiscal year I believe so I don't know what's going on inflation's down thank you Mr Anthony and the other citizen like to comment all right say some comments are closed and now we're back to the council before we continue I'm going to need a motion for authorization for execution of this contract so moved motion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second second by Lloyd Roberts uh vice mayor Shirley you have the floor needed we take a vote other questions or comments Mr Baker um page four of this contract a new refreshment the council's memory and the cities that Feller Shores shares our deputy how many hours a day does he share to one hour per ship from one for children I don't have those numbers in front of me I know it's been reviewed at least at least in the past two years if I can find that out but I forgot what was determined um I was told it was like one hour per shift but a couple residents have raised questions to me and I've noticed in the last couple weeks and I'm not and I'm excluding July 4th weekend because Bel Air Shores have to be paid for extra research Deputy service but just noticing on the beach in the parking lots very frequent just one day two weeks ago the deputy spent almost three hours from Sixth Street to 12th Street ticketing cars taking a tent off of The Sixth Street taking two umbrellas off of 12th Street and taking two bicycles off at 6th Street now we spend over seventeen thousand dollars per hour at 365 days a week for 47 some dollars an hour I believe Bel Air Shores is getting a boring here because we no longer get the tax we never no longer get the fines for the parking and there's three parking lots so they get out they have to write it up one citizens did an inquiry or how much time is being expected was well over more than three hours a day because if you look at the house calls they do every day and they do them twice a day there's no way they can do this in two hours and I believe we should be getting should be getting at least three hours a day back to us for the service which would save you guys in our 17 over seventeen thousand dollars in this contract so I think we should table this contract on that floor right now that we should make a motion to enable this contract until we get a review on how much time Belair Shores is actually using our Deputy on our time we have a motion in the table on the floor right now would anyone like to second that motion all right the motion dies so the conversation will continue with anyone else like to make a comment about this contract yes sir yeah I understand that obviously the rate didn't go up in referring to code enforcement but the dollar amount does not because the lower hours obviously offset any potential increase here um what I'm going to ask I mean I understand the concerns about Bel Air Shores but at this point I believe the best method is actually you approve the contract and now that we have the contract that we go forward to approach Miller Shores with you know reducing the potential hours in because this contract is between us and the county not us and Bel Air Shores so I'm recommending that we go forward and uh with this contract thank you Mr zabel another comments currently or the legal question can we sign this contract and then go back and charge Bellair sure that we find out here using and they've got to be more than they're paying for this contract specifically provides that you're going to share of the Deputy doesn't say anything other than that so once you assign this contract this will as for any contributions made or set out by Miller ashore that would be an agreement between this city and Bel Air Shore have nothing to do with the sheriff and my question is it's an open-ended contract when it comes to time that we're sharing and study it is open-ended to the extent that we use the word share and doesn't have any specifics that's and that's my that's my problem that we're getting our citizens are getting tickets into our citizens are telling them they need to remove this and they have to move to remove that thing our Deputy we're paying our Deputy to do that I can't I can't vote on a contract until we get some specifics I'm not sure whether or not this has changed from last year whether this was the same language as last year I don't know that's from what I understand it's the same language the same assessment of the percentage of time I believe it is and because other areas have similar contracts with the sheriff's department I think that the goal is is to be able to to tend to demand anywhere that it's needed and other than the sheriff not being here tonight or the sheriff's department not being here tonight which I'm very disappointed about considering we're debating over their contract I have no complaints service that we've received I think that we could step up directly such as the straight Long Street Parking things like that and I would also be interested in knowing if part of that contract includes them being here because this is I believe is the second or the third time that we've had a meeting a public meeting and did not have any coverage so I do have a problem with that and it needs to be resolved I don't think that it will it definitely won't prevent me from voting for this contract however I want this address going forward and I think no matter what we should always have someone on site to make sure that the community and the council and the staff are all safe any other questions or comments let's take it to a vote all right this is for authorization of city manager to execute a contract for law enforcement services with the Pinellas County Sheriff for fiscal year 2023 2024 Patty council member gankord no council member Livingstone yes councilmember Otero council member Roberts aye council members Abel all right vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess all right so it passes six to one one three for you or offered amen item 18 unfinished business do we have any unfinished business all right we will move right on over to city council comments which by the way this is item number 19. this month the randomizer begins with council member zabel great um two big uh items that are up in front of Florida people right now especially us uh one is Beach renourishment and the second one is high insurance rates and I just wanted to draw your attention to the work the city council specifically uh councilman Baker and is continuing fight to get lower insurance rates or even get questions about the insurance rates answered by our elected representatives in Tallahassee second of all is a Peachtree nourishment the mayor has been uh very vocal in working with various local groups specifically on this topic and maybe you can address it later on but the next Big C median I understand there's going to be some updates on that issue and I believe we're hosting it here on the 26th yes okay so that's uh we usually Supply free food you know coffee and it's really good to understand what's going on with the rest of the beach communities that's all they have thank you thank you Mr Sable all right now we are on to council member nataro all right we'll move right on over to council member Banker um today I sat down with a representative Ken barefield our state rep about wind Insurance um and the changes they made last December He was unaware of a couple of things and stuff and I'm talking about in the Statue now which requires each individual if they want to carry win insurance and now has to match the flood insurance and she pointed out to me that she's looking into secondary homes compared to primary homes and maybe adjusting the rage there to make it more equal but um one of the things I addressed to her was about insurance fraud and what they've what the state has done now is they put themselves in a 750 billion dollar liability when it comes to cost because they're escalating all these policies to be faxed now so you have to match it 250 75 000 for contents then your flood has been maxed back and to rebuild some of these homes are well under four hundred thousand dollars so the first thing people do to get an insurance adjuster to come out and they just great for everybody now she says well you know that's insurance fraud and then I gave her the statistics that there was over 125 000 roofing insurance fraud claims were found fraudulent claims just in 2020. I said so if they found 125 000 how many really got away with it so she's going to re-address this and get back to me with a couple people in the state and the other thing is I've been talking to Ray Scott's office I thought I was getting somewhere with him and the end of last month he sent me a consent form to get into this paper and then last Monday I got another consent form from one of his Liaisons to fill out and I actually blew a gasket I had his chief of staff on the phone say no it was a misunderstanding we're going to get it so I wrote the Rick Scott and I mail it right down it was Naples address and I did get a call today from FEMA we're going to have a sit down hopefully within a week or two about the percentages deduction noted in 2.0 for per flood elevation that everyone is supposed to be getting here but if you look at your elevation certificate without your or with if you look at your premiums without your elevation certificates it's probably the same with your elevation certificates and for each foot or H6 inches you're supposed to receive a discount plus the city is supposed to get a 20 discount for the things we did to modify to 2.0 and nobody from the nfip FEMA can show us where that discount is so that's all I understand thank you Mr Baker all right Mr Roberts you're up thank you I just want to compliment both Mike and Frank at our last uh Workshop that we had a topic came up that Mike had been working on for a while regarding the sandbag challenges that we have back over here on the 9th Street and the cool part about it was so my made his presentation as to why he thought the best idea and how many of you people saw this was to move the sandbagging operation to the marina which was an idea and then Frank said brought up reasons as well why that probably wasn't the most effective process for our city for our citizens that's when it really happened and this should happen I think each and every time we have discussions about what we think is best for our city because through a discussion by all seven adults that are up here a whole different approach came to be which was really the best solution and fixed the problem the problem was traffic flow coming in and out but through that discussion I don't know how many you people have actually participated in that infamous you're on a rocket ship and you crash on the moon and you have 15 items and you need to rank from 1 through 15 that's the most important thing you do it individually and then you get together in a group and I've done it many many times with with departments that I've worked with and and each and every time the group solution is superior to every single individual ranking in the 10 to 15 member group has been put together and that's what actually happened with this scenario about the sandbag operation because Mike then heard different input and he put together a solution that we excuse me remove the traffic flow problem which there's a little space behind us over here that's going to allow the traffic if everybody agrees to it to come down 9th Street and then exit all in one motion and get back out onto Gulf Boulevard which was really the problem so it's just kind of cool I just want to thank everybody on this Council to work that through and it came out really nice thank you council member Livingstone I just wanted to thank MS condu MR leaks for volunteering Vice all right okay this month I have little to report concerning Beach nourishment at The Big C Beach nourishment dominated the meeting however the county is still holding out in hopes that the Army Corps will have a change of heart I get the feeling that the county is afraid that if they fully fund it once they will be expected to fund it every time in the meantime the majority of the millions collected from the FED tax continues to be spent on Advertising to bring more and more people to our beaches perhaps I'm missing something that if there's no beach when they get here then what happens I would encourage everyone here to contact your County Commissioners not just one not just the one that represents us but every single one of them and demand that the county creative plan and fully find speech nourishment for Sand Key island as mentioned once before Council we have an upcoming budget workshop and tentative millage rate meeting on the 17th and finally I have heard Rumblings that at least four members on this Council are either ineligible or have decided not to run again apparently having to submit full Financial disclosures is already having an impact which I suspect was the whole purpose of enacting it so the question is do we really need seven council members or should we reduce to five next should we increase our terms to four years and align them with a general and midterm elections aside from cost uh cost savings overall turnout should increase dramatically finally should we increase term limits to three currently we are limited to six years or two terms I have seen firsthand that this limit prevents our city from gaining any traction in the county our needs and our opinions have little weight in Pinellas County due to the lack of time to build these relationships I question to each of you is are you willing to consider restructuring the city council in our election cycle I ask this because it's very very important to me that our city do is its very best and it looks like the path that we're going right now we're not going to have either the amount or the quality of candidates we've had in the past so I just want to take a informal survey right quick um Miss material would you be interested in having that conversation Mr is able yes Miss Livingstone Mr Roberts about the changes yes Mr Banker no vice mayor Shirley yes all right so I have a four to two and then I would make five so uh I will be reaching out to Patty to see if we can schedule a work session to discuss this whether we make changes or not I believe it would be irresponsible of us not to have this conversation as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as those who watch remotely do I have a motion to ensure motion made by brain Danger he's always first starting line right can you please do in a second for me uh Leslie all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
