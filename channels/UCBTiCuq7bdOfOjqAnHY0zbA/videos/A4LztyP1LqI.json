listening listening stuff thank you I like that double testing okay um do we need a motion to approve your I don't think so right [Music] okay discussion of Halloween events yes yeah well we have actually it is let me see what the date when it is we're good on that part but the we're asking for volunteers so ask your friends your neighbors to volunteer for our Halloween pal we have the Saturday October 28th okay I had some dates in red in Ohio it's earlier it's 10 to 12 this year right 10 to 12 two hours yes um it's in the minutes um Kyle I had a few areas in the minutes with the um I just want to mention that actually since we passed minutes that I had um I wasn't exactly the short of the date you guys chose so I just put possible day conflict it would had something to do with the mayor's cook-off and the beach cleanup and you wanted to confirm if you were still doing it yeah they're both on Saturday so they're both exactly correct eight to nine and twelve to two yeah okay okay so these will be correct from now on okay perfect I did a big packet okay I wrote on it I don't care okay okay so um on the Halloween party we are looking we've got Dave and Wendy we don't have Michael this year their son to help with the Overflow because I think this is mine Tammy said that he was um I mean he's off at school but he kind of guided the dogs where they were supposed to be he doesn't need somebody Dave and Wendy's Son oh okay guided the dog so we yeah just kind of keeping him away from the kids if we had kids so we need somebody for that a dog guide we need more judges how many do we have well we only have for sure Jewels but um Terry was going to talk to the zabels and talk to Frank again but they've not confirmed okay so for the last two years my girlfriend Darlene did it okay so I can speak with Darlene and also my son has done it and I think he's going to sponsor one of the events so I could check with Anthony if he'd like to be a judge again he's done it before I've done it but I'm going to be working the event I could Frank I think I did five or six last year no you cut it down I think she was talking about cutting it down really well you have to have an odd number okay right okay yeah it's better that way I'll confirm with Tammy how many she wants okay if you're sure that's correct not just and I'm pretty sure okay five peeps needed definitely wants us all to dress up on the parks and rec committee to dress up Halloween you up for that uh yeah I can put on a hat that works um was it my understanding that we had somebody who was sponsoring the dog treats this time and doing the bags herself or something like that I she wasn't going to do it oh yeah something that we have way too many left over yeah and that even some people did take them their dogs didn't like them so I thought she said you're gonna cut that out I don't have anything about it that's in your minutes oh that helping hand program foreign [Applause] I don't remember anything about that in the minutes when I read them but um we did talk about it that um she said she probably won't do that either cutting it down a lot yeah I can't confirm I can't remember exactly the trunk retreat but um yeah yeah but if you mean if she said something about it yeah she said no for that there weren't a lot of volunteers for that yeah that's true so it'll just be the parade of kids parade of pets here's your bag of your treats and yeah that was the main event yeah so we're still gonna do um three prizes for each of the children three prizes for kids and pets um I guess there's still going to be some form of parade to display not a marching parade but uh display I don't know last year they were just they were there just showed up and then they got them in order okay yeah that's it that's that's the parade just putting them in orders so the judges could see them and keeping the pets this way and the kids that way I'll go with Tammy on this stuff and then I will include it and just say we discussed it last meeting and I'm putting it in forward here I'll get exactly what she wants okay okay and then we can go from there and if you want because October is not that far away after I do the minutes and then approved by Patty I can send them to everyone so then you'll know about that awesome for I'll I'll check whether and then I'll confirm okay yeah that way okay great Patty yeah yeah yeah and the list I don't know if she sent that to everybody or not this is just what she wanted volunteers for okay and she just signed into something back to the Amazon gift cards printed out she has Pat and Rich benavinto the new video oh yeah they do it every year she has them at the sign up table right she has jewels as a judge and potential Mike and James Abel friends and all the other things is what she wanted volunteers for it at least that's how I got it from her she was talking 90 miles an hour faster than normal okay this looks like um an item list of stuff we need and the and the people to you know work the tables I don't know who Jessica tanamachi is ah she's new she just moved here okay she I guess she's volunteering see I had it right it says treat bag sponsored by I knew I heard that treat bags sponsored by Jessica tanamachi for glasses I thought I thought that's what I I heard Phil poor John in over here I just want to say for the record I'm I'm listening but whatever help anybody needs on any of these projects I am available oh thank you John yeah didn't your dog win last year yes sign me up and let me know okay well you're working one of the tables then John John whose dog won last year although I have been informed that you only get to win once because you like to spread it around which I agree with just one year off well I actually have a new little dog this year so I would enter them I'm going to enter them anyway um [Music] might as well be we'll have a dog we'll have a dog fight but I'll I'll work a table too obviously thank you brother to bring both dogs so the owner can win five years in a row as long as they bring a difference I'll just dress up one of my other grandkids because my granddaughter won last year yeah thank you three seconds yeah so I got no instructions from Tammy about this sheet she just said I gave you a Halloween sheet so I'm assuming that she just meant try to get volunteers to do all these things well I'll be here for sure she wants somebody to pass out the water if she wants somebody to donate the water no just moved by the water right yeah okay so it's just somebody to man that table or that section okay I think this is kind of just like a list out of what she works with every year um just to go over okay so let me just see what the city's providing the prizes the water the donuts um water bowls or or brings them okay um the decorations are probably from everyone or you I don't remember any specific decorations other than the costumes okay and you have the music speaker in mind right okay Kyle or city DJ Grady okay treat bags and I know we have the leftover score sheets yeah and they had to wait a specific oh yeah I did it yeah it was good we had it we just wrote the number on that and put it in a cup now I retaliate a lot faster so that first year with her off learn something new every year I did tell Tammy I may not be able if we have a work session the day before to be here on the day before because I have I may be traveling but I I will be back for the Saturday for sure okay yeah that's usually not too much ahead of time but we'll make the treat bags if we're going for the kids yeah well the girls ahead of time yeah uh let me find out from time here Tammy okay she's right now she's not going to be here but some changes may happen that she may have to stay so okay yeah I'll ask Tammy what um Jessica's treat bags are going to entail a little more okay any other input question questions about it or anything this is your first one yes that's really cute I mean the dogs are really you know if you like Fufu dogs and then there's some the big dogs and they dress them up and it's really cute we had Sherlock Holmes and Watson last year oh my goodness they were so cute weren't they that's right creative creative that's where I was looking for yeah of course all kids are cute when they dress up but yeah they are all the ones okay so any other info on the Halloween that you think we need to discuss or ask questions about or no please I think we need some clarification on things and either me or Kyle will get it out to everyone as soon as possible okay um health and wellness Fair again if you print it from home you should have got something like this yeah if not the back of this I'll try to separate them but yep it's the last three or four pages and it doesn't come out correctly because it's Excel so and it's printed differently in that one versus this one but anyway these Shades go like they're just an extension okay so these are the people and mostly this is for you Tammy said because you requested it this list okay okay um she didn't want to get into too many too much detail until we get closer into the thing but um because she likes to contact the other people that we wrote previously no no no these are the people that were here last night okay and she likes to confirm with the previous people before she contacts new people and she doesn't like to or we don't like to um duplicate like not two dentists not two massage therapists not two yeah well this will give us a good idea of what we have now and who we can still I think we do have a dentist already right because it's mine okay Bel Air Dental holistic holistic yeah because I would have asked another dentist so I'm glad and then I did ask Pilates and they're they're thinking about what they can do they're seeing if they can put up a table and speak to the people about the program and give them maybe a free class or something or an intro class to people who come by so I'm working on them they have the letter so um is that your Pilates Place yeah Club Pilates and she did put um a key at the bottom that says no go and that's the green people that aren't bringing our logos so [Applause] um we're all still supposed to try to get more vendors but just don't make sure you duplicate and if there's somebody specific on this list that somebody here would like to contact that would be great but just tell us ahead of time so we don't like you call even star acupuncture and I call him also so so they're green so there's the greens are definite that's what the herbs and the yellows are potentials potentials to be confirmed I try anybody ever heard a stretch lab I've heard of it okay well Lloyd and I just started going so the stretch lap so for example the stretch lab just those stretch therapist is out yeah so that would be a good replacement I got you okay so I'm gonna score if I can call them and ask and because they're really cool do a 30-minute sentence yeah it's better than themselves oh yeah I know I'm barely lives but Lord and so it and it has really helped him yeah um Club Pilates said they can help with a raffle as well at some point so they'll give like maybe a like a three-month membership or something something like that yeah one month I don't know but they did tell me hit us up for a raffle all right yeah I now have 352 classes under my belt so wow they like wow almost a whole year of classes yeah I think it's um it was a year and two months or two years and two months yeah so anyway sometimes every day yeah when I first started I was only 11 twice so twice a week and then um I was still really sick from my spinal cord surgery and everything so after that I started to get stronger and stronger and then I go like almost every day I'm addicted to it nice that's cool yeah men go too yes it was working again I've just got a message for it okay so Patty's going to reach out to be just standing in a stretch lab just just a quick question here I'm looking at the calendar and at least the way it's uh presented uh by Patty with the minutes uh it looks like it runs from January of 23 to December 23 um you know looking at the dates and all that I'm wondering if um okay so like the health health and wealth uh Wellness fair right now since Saturday 113. 23 uh are we just going to do that on Saturday 114 24. I mean I guess my question is kind of relevant to all the events is uh should this schedule that we've got right now these two preliminary schedule should this be updated for the new calendar year pretty far ahead um yeah because sometimes it dates I mean usually a little bit before or around a year before Tammy kind of checks with the city calendar to see what's available and makes decisions I think these are actually just looking at the calendar I think that the 23 just needs to be changed these are actually 24. oh my goodness so much for my good notes so 113.24 is a Saturday is that what you're asking 2 3 24. yeah that's what I'm asking oh let's see what we got so The Saturdays are correct the dates are correct the year is wrong Geez Louise don't know that that's right I just looked at this um I see yeah I'm looking at my calendar 113. yeah starting from one six the day before yeah they just didn't change the year that was me yeah that's a good catch I've got Saturday okay I see okay teens is okay January 13th is a Saturday in 2024. soil needs to be date all it needs to be changed [Music] okay yep okay I got it John on the previous page Saturday the 6th January 6th also needs to be changed to 24. correct I agree okay very good cash thank you yeah I'm awake guys yeah Stone Cold and silver too I'm not that's the problem no kidding really kidding okay any other discussion on the wellness Fair any questions nope uh if you uh if it says here you're looking for volunteers for a dermatologist or an optometrist I don't know if you're still looking for that or whatever and I don't have any but I would be willing to make phone calls or something like that if somebody wanted me to do that to find one of them if that's what you think you're looking for right and German so I don't know who's in charge of the event or whether our whole group is in charge of the event I'm just I'm just throwing that out there that I would make some phone calls and see if I could well I kept and make phone calls until I got one I guess would be the point so what did he say dermatologist and whatever and optometrists I definitely for Optometry and Bay Dermatology is on here Bay Dermatology is twice and once they're green and once they're yellow I think I saw that the reason I uh I have uh I don't know actually what do you call the guys that actually yeah you have eyeglasses but I have a cataract Ophthalmology I think that's a that's an optometrist and therefore I believe I'm going to be wind up winding up interfacing with some of these people uh anyway here in the near future and therefore it's not too far afield uh for me to sign up for that I guess uh cataracts is usually an ophthalmologist okay okay I want somebody that like somebody that just give what's an optometrist uh what do the Opticians are the guys that sell glasses right yeah they just fit them and sell them an optometrist does the eye exams and they can discover the cataracts and send you to the ophthalmologist yes yes okay well that's the guy you have to talk to reschedule anyway yeah and if you said you didn't want to do it I'd say well you know who if I didn't use you who would you refer me to you know what I'm saying so I could just go ahead and make a series of calls and find uh maybe find an optometrist here before maybe this guy okay sounds good so I just want to point out here it does say shadow vision and that's my optometrist that's why I used too yeah okay so he's on there so I mean if you're gonna call that person you know that would maybe be and you can say Patty's on you know a client I'm a client yeah you shuttle and I have to reschedule my appointment because I'm coming home a little earlier than I planned so um anyway or actually anyway that that's why I'm going to be called the guy anyway and so I just spent a bunch of money over there so I figured me this is a perfect event for this guy's close and everything else maybe he'll do it if he doesn't but I'll make a few other calls okay yeah that's good they already have information on all this stuff I brought them information from the Bel Air Community Foundation asking them for donations for that so um I think this will be a good fit for them in addition to that I have a dermatologist that I can head out to also instead of you just code calling and I'll I'll try to do that Deb uh could I then uh maybe contact you and get whatever the backup background information you have on shuttle so I'm not actually but if he's already been contacted I don't want to roll yeah it's okay I'll just say I don't know we already did this what do you say you know yeah no I just gave it to them they had it to review so you could follow up with them I think that's a great idea but you John feel free to call me anytime okay all right that's what I'll I'll do all right I'll do that okay my good money input here um yeah I'll look over I was thinking um I mean I haven't called in any of these so it doesn't you know it doesn't matter I just see the one one thing that looks like a full Gap is the coffee meal I'm assuming they were supplying the morning coffee or they did in lobby so I made me just you know a coffee sponsor or whatever I could try to read yeah they said they weren't going to do it again this year oh no that's unfortunate and I'm assuming that's why they're green but um there's the Indian Rocks Beach Cafe Indian rice yeah it and then there's also Crabby Bills on people and whatever repeats there's Panera too I mean now of course we love Bel Air what is it called the one that's right yeah yeah but I think the last time I think they said donated the first year and then they didn't want to do it again but I think Michael if you want to call a coffee place and get a coffee that would be great Panera yeah okay perfect so that's perfect Michael do I have the right name yeah I know so what so what's the what's the ask I mean how many attendees or yes it's um 25 registration fee there is an official letter okay and that official letter I will have Tammy send to everyone she only wanted to give one ounce to start with of the letter because she said you had asked for one yes I had asked her for one because I wanted to hit up Pilates and if you guys want I can quickly read you the letter okay and but she prefers emails rather than what I'm thinking the the Panera so I was thinking that that's more of a that's more of an ass when I asked them to be a part of the fair that's more of a we need someone to sponsor Refreshments yeah just donate the refreshments yeah okay so it says the city of Bellaire Beach and and Bellaire Beach and our Park and Recreation board are planning our third annual health and wellness fair and would love to have you participate in our event our goal is to educate our residents and provide information on local Health and Care options it is an open house format and the date is Saturday January 13th from 10 30 to 1 30 but we changed that okay two hours instead so it was now it's 10 30. no it's 11 30 to 1 30. 11 30. but that also says tentative okay well we'll have to um change it in the letter change time and letter but we definitely decided to cut down the number of hours yes two hours yes so that's why it says yeah that's why it says correct time to be determined but yeah uh we'll check timer Tammy yeah I'm pretty sure and then those that might have to be changed in the notes as well okay um we will provide table and promote the event in advance to get maximum attendance the cost for participate participation is 25 um please contact owner okay notes so yeah so this letter basically contains everything you either need to say to them or to hand them um doors open at 9 30 for setup the address so that's what this says so the the um and again I'm just kind of locking in on the entrepreneurial request here how many people roughly I mean she went through our doors is what you're asking maybe a hundred that was more than that do you remember uh a hundred minimum I had said 150. Yeah well yeah with the people in the event maybe yeah because we provided food for them didn't we the vendors yeah we had like some snacks and some sandwiches and stuff like that snacks and drinks snacks sandwiches and drinks were provided but if you were asking them they're not they're not a coffee specialist but they might bring like their pastries or something small version of their pastries things or whatever but okay so I'm gonna say 150ish yeah it's a safe number do you know if Publix does like the crafts of coffee or anything like that or seen in Publix they sell a a private label brand that is excellent it's always my downscale buy when they take Starbucks off sale it's very good is it pre-made oh yeah you can buy it there you know and and uh either grow I think it's either ground or whole bean they're just in with uh everybody else there but I'm if anyway they have something to sell there actually they should want to promote that it's very they're uh private label is excellent okay thank you thank you thank you but the the Publix that's the Publix that's here number nine is the green wives they're promoting their green wiser yes because again it's health and wellness right yeah so we don't know if we want you know Dunkin Donuts coffee because that's not health and wellness and we don't want Dunkin Donuts donut holes there why not why isn't it health and wellness they're donating it they're not participating but they're yeah I know but that's kind of um people want their desserts in the morning not the answer organic coffee okay any other discussion on the wellness Fair questions or okay all right moving on to number seven this is you guys permanent signage with the QR code for events and magnets anything any update on that anything happen we a simple concept I mean this is obviously it doesn't hurt any feelings that if nobody likes it but looking more like on the magnets within the science assignment would be the same thing but here's a here's a rendering a concept oh wow did you get a price uh no not yet because I wasn't going to do that until I oh wow if you were to do like a permanent sign and you did something that was smaller I'd say it cost between like 30 bucks out yeah aluminum custom-made sign so this is for the metal signs that would be we could use that for both now to hand metal and we would put this like at Morgan and Morgan and maybe hearing the city hall yeah and maybe the other parking lots or no the 19 and 12 and 6. wherever you go wherever we go yeah that's pretty cool though even at the park we did a nice job designing it on the intercoastal I mean if it's just the sign that's not this size right yeah do you know how to do them where they're tied into things or there's there's a little apps QR codes all you do is you create the site page and then you can just make it okay it can go straight to Bella beach.com or whatever in that way all you're doing is updating your events guys so question yeah that's pretty cool um if you're making magnets would you be giving them out to your residents as well like an awesome bag and or in welcome bags or just in general are we going to give them to everyone I don't know I mean I think magnets can't be that expensive whatever I'm like online yeah yeah I may be able to get you a sponsor for them yeah I mean if you're able to find a sponsor for madness at the phenomenal yeah the really good thing about this is that it's Timeless yeah because it's tied to what you're updating well you're changing yeah I love it yeah so that's right wow um that's cool uh how many if I got a sponsor how many magnets would we need and what size would they be so I can see for pricing I would say a 4x4 is probably a good because you got bigger people with vision problems um so 4x4 yeah some that like you um uh I think 4x4 probably be the best in my opinion um the signage though we probably do a I don't know maybe 10 by 10. or something where people could see it yeah and the signs you the cost of the metal pole it sticks now um yeah so cool okay so how many uh Madness as far as I think Ruby say we have full-time residency we have about 1600 right 1600 so that's a lot that's total so you figure house households I think we have maybe 800 cut it in half I mean I don't know that's a lot of magnets they're donated I mean not to worry about that that's a lot of magnets all right but hey but try 500 see what that would do okay yeah um would the sponsor be able to include their name on it somewhere like below it for the first one yeah sponsored by yeah on the back of a major that would be yeah we're gonna probably display your logo on the backup magnet a good salesperson I like your little design though yeah that's really cool thanks let's catchy with the colors too and if it's in our other places that's yeah that's why I remember one time I made a suggestion about maybe we could change some of our signs to look more welcoming because the people across the street you know their signs all go no no no no no and it's like enjoy our beach jump after yourself or something you know don't yeah all right I don't like to open those everything well it just cuts a lot I mean you just think about even the um what we were talking about which we uh that Dave says in here I mean all of that becomes what's the current what's the most current thing yeah you're there but do people know how to use those I mean covet kind to help them but I'm still a little bit of an idiot with it you think the elderly open your camera yeah I'm aware of it Park Mobile's got them on their side so yeah okay yeah I I think it's a great idea I mean a simple concept fabulous I love it thank you Michael any other discussion on that well I think Aaron's checking out pricing sure yeah yeah [Music] all right come on yeah he is holding that phone pretty far away China this is better for me but yeah that's why I got a bigger phone so I can respond people laugh at him watch it's not so large well while Aaron's doing that I just want to say the park by my house looks so much better yeah it looks so nice yeah it looks really good it's really nice yeah the fencing helped a lot it goes from 750 750 magnets to a thousand that's kind of the oh okay yeah so a thousand magnets is 387 bucks that's good 387 dollars for a thousand yeah wow like 4. 387 a piece and I could actually I mean if we don't get that if we don't get that donated I mean it's up to you I can because my old businesses I have friends who still do it we can probably get a better deal than that oh okay okay yeah it's looking good he you know works all around here was living in here for a while so if that's okay I'm going to approach Anthony and um he's eager to do anything so that did good okay all right number eight inventory anything that you need do we need more bags do we need more stickers do we need more merch to go in it or whatever you want to call it because I know there's no more kitchen towels Tammy okay yeah I mean there's only five bags back there right now that have stuff in them I don't even know do we still have bags Publix that we still have the paper stuff that's my master there's only five paper bags back yeah yeah but more of those you got more stickers okay yeah I mean that one usually she figures something out to do next I know I got still have I have hand towels and things there okay and the dish towels are dish towels is what's in there the hand towels are knots okay yeah there's this towels I think it sells them in the office too windowsill dish towels are not available please so you don't know if more bags are needed you do you know there's five but yeah but Kyle said he has more bags and stickers to make yeah okay so makeup we need the stuff to go inside okay it's just deadly to Tammy okay all right so number nine this is the biggie discussion of the beach cleanup and having a different point person each month so we there's five of us and so we can each take two I guess there's two months we don't do it or some where there are six of us there's six of us uh-huh so we just get two there is Michael Patty me

with the um it's October garage sale uh was that it well I don't know I'm asking well maybe that's why there was because we were going to change things November and may may okay so just remember you cannot do your garage sale on the 4th of November right because I think we did last year we pushed it to the second weekend because of the he's good no you didn't change it last year because I couldn't participate in both and I tried what about so spring one did we do that we choose it then was it November you couldn't participate no it was both of them so I said for the next time please remember to change them because yeah that's what it was yeah I did participate it just wasn't you know because the garage sale people they're there at seven if it starts at eight I mentioned sir we're still on beach cleanup right we're just talking about the conflict with some with Dave yeah garage sale yes sir just conflict with dates how about if you and I attentively do Saturday April sixth uh Saturday April for me is fine okay I'm gonna put that down October and April and I mean I can pick up uh uh I can I can do uh what did you say at November December are taken yes sir November and December what I can do then I'll do uh I'll do October February and April and if we can't find somebody in a couple of other deals uh I'll I'll do them too I always do the thing I love the event okay I can do the June one and I'm thinking August but I don't know I was getting ready to say we don't have to complete complete these are tentatives and we want people thinking about it and it's really it's you're just being the point person because please come as many Saturdays as you can of course right um so I I'll just the June one put me down for sure and then we'll try to figure out another all right listen I'm gonna take I think I'm gonna take March 2nd and April 6th okay John and then if I can't do them I'll let you know maybe you do April 6th for me and I'll do one okay I did I'll be fine we're not doing a May deal then is that am I wrong or am I right we're still finding out I know about what you're talking about and I can't remember what we did we say we're gonna move the garage sale or we say we're gonna move the cleaning so then the garage I was gonna it's gonna be the second Saturday of November so um May 4th would be the Saturday right um the fishing the fishing opener might uh interfere with that it might be out of there but so uh I should probably um uh I actually am planning on being a daughter for so I want to do that uh uh get down there in July for a couple weeks just to look the place over and I'll try to be at the deal and then do the uh The Causeway uh cleanup but I probably shouldn't Deb would you would you what what if you signed up for May and I did April well you know Tammy and I still get the pigs leave some I'm sorry again I said you don't have to do all of them John there's still Tammy and I yeah I'll take May John I'll take May all right well I'll take April okay and did you say it's May 4th yeah so I'll do uh April 6th and you know okay on a monthly basis we're still meeting every month so there's some kind of a problem and I'm available I'll I'll always take that post I don't have a problem with that okay um Patty you want to choose dates or okay here's Tammy uh there are months that aren't taken after everyone else checked you guys called John right he sent me a text okay um yes let's see here Tammy what is this this is August coming up is this August we did this one already okay September and okay now September's a biggie I'm not here Tammy's night physically and it's also CEO's day I will do Saturday that day the 9th September 9th does that help no September 2nd yeah September 2nd yes that does help a lot because Tammy will probably be there but she can't bend down she can't lift she can't do anything that's okay she's gonna be she'll be there she said she would probably stand on the beach okay but it's also with with the foundation and this is the next thing on here but it's the um I'll do this okay yeah I'll do this one with that um okay so um and we need volunteers to plant the Sea Oats so we're hoping some of the beach cleanup people will stay and plant the seals so do we have every slot full uh every slot filled no because now I'm doing September John's doing yeah what's over I have October down September and you have October I'm doing October I have two Octobers down baby oh my goodness okay and Susan has November and December November and December okay so then the next one is the sixth I can do that January 6th I already signed up I signed up for February but if if nobody could nobody wants to do Saturday January 6th I can do that okay you have John as the Saturday the Third [Applause] one yeah all the way down in July and August so marches open no she has Mark oh you got you could take it though or you could take my April my May from me or whatever works which September we can take one away your March or your um or your May what works better for you Michael so the only reason I shot away from March is that's um my birthday's at the end of February so I don't try to block people out okay would you like to do May yeah so so May 4th is a real date yeah so that doesn't conflict with the garage sale no he's changing the garage sale oh okay all right so I'll do May and June oh May and June yeah he already had June yeah and yeah yeah okay okay so that leaves July amazing gotcha okay so that leaves July I'll tell her okay and I only have one July and August so something must go I'll take August you'll take August yeah so that leaves her would do awesome John must have three John I think John should no yeah he has October and he has April and he has February okay so he has to give up some of the Tammy so um so we still have a few uh dates left open we could we can probably figure them out by the next meeting John we don't have any dates left over you have three okay that sounds fair sounds good to me so I'm gonna I think I'm gonna put Tammy down unless she has a conflicts we'll change it on July July and then are you sure you're okay doing three John oh yeah no no problem okay so what does that leave Patty doing one more me too I have August and something else and January who has September I do that's mean that's happening right away yes you know um March is I think May okay March my birthday month too but you're at the end of February okay do I have it let me just go down the list since I'm somewhat scattered today okay so Saturday the 9th is Debbie Saturday I'm sorry October is John and he's also volunteering for Pets and Pals Saturday uh November 4th is Susan December 2nd is Susan January's Patty Saturday Beach cleanup is John I have for February yep okay um Debbie for March John for April oh Michael for June and may may may separated here May and June back to back Tammy July Patty August yep so the reason we're short one is September going back to September so I can give Tammy September September 25 okay yep okay you made 24. no because it would have to be yeah so really it was in you and I yeah yeah yeah September 2nd yes so Deb are you going to put on list okay perfect yeah we're gonna do Tammy and me together uh she's gonna come but I'm gonna run it we're gonna do all the pickups yeah on the ninth uh September nine two nine two okay so she's gonna do July and nine two not this Saturday next Saturday yeah and that's the CEO yes also I'm just not the sea outs are not unless it's the foundation but the foundation is asking for volunteers and since we're out there anyway right you know multitask hopefully we can get some and if you have anybody neighbors that will be willing you're we're planting behind the condos right down I will not be doing that and they are also asking if we somebody can pick them up the Sea Oats I'm looking at you I mean Puerto Rico oh okay I'm in Denver we're all over there we should get our get our t-shirts with the QR code on the back so people tendency where's Bel Air Beach so that's cool because once you get that QR code it's you can slap it anywhere yeah wow that's amazing and the point person what they have to do is Kyle really does it all I think on the beach you you ordered the donuts or if she orders and you pick up or vice versa okay um do you order and pick up or you just ordered no I just well yeah I have to go that way and you bring it here and she picks it up here where do you bring them I don't bring them anywhere she picks them up in the morning oh okay Publix yeah okay and then she has the bars she said in her at her house and she'll bring them up here the healthy snacks the donuts are the non-healthy and the bars are the healthy and this is uh we're putting together the to-do list is that correct yes and it will go to you before don't worry about it you don't need it today um Tammy was going to write it up because she's been doing it forever of all the steps that you need to do I know one step is you need signatures from your volunteers well again that's a paper that you get from yeah just I just know it's one thing we do so that will come from Aaron also the snacks I guess you do Waters as well correct and that comes from you right it doesn't just come here she just comes here she has her own cooler though I believe that's hers elf what what about the donuts yeah we'll take care of getting the donuts too see Aaron orders and the point person picks them up at Publix there's a person in charge for that day get to tell them what kind of donuts he's supposed to get I'm just kidding guys uh cake all right I'm just kidding here so that's the way we're gonna do it we are still here so uh Aaron goes down and picks up all this her uh pad was was up to Publix and picks up all this stuff beforehand now he orders it the point person picks it up that is the person running it that month okay so the guy running it or the person running it goes up and picks up whatever it is and they also order the stuff no sir Aaron orders it and the point person for the month will go and pick it up we'll pick it up at Publix and then come and pick the things up at City Hall I got it okay but we will have that all written down a sheet a to-do list we'll do a to-do list you will be prepared ahead of time all right I have a question about the donuts uh could they possibly be picked up the night before yeah they're going to be fresh enough what they do is they just take the box donuts and they put them in the box they give it to us so we really don't need to order boxing Cream Donuts because they're already in the box but I have to do that anyway so what only because you have to pay them for it they don't make the box of cream but that's especially for us all right you really think they're that different how much early what do I have to get up at five to get the donuts no um no you don't seem to understand for me sometimes but you're sharing that with Tammy she could probably pick up the donuts all right she wakes up at three exactly show nuts and again we just need you out there yes I will do everything with it in the back of her card set up the tablet or her lifting any anything okay all right any other business or any other questions about Beach cleanup before we move on to other business nobody this is another list that's going to come out from Deb I take it to do list along with Tammy assignments been doing it for years okay sounds good he is going to put the to-do list on the agenda it actually says that John but you don't have an agenda in front of you yeah I know oh okay well look look at number nine it says this is going to begin in September will be given to the lead person all right I can see it I see it I see it Patty you're absolutely right okay it says we're going to get a list yes sir yes ma'am okay I just wanted to go back to one question please the garage sale will definitely be moved to the second week in November and April no remember me okay I'm glad I checked all over the place today jeez Louise I'm not even not right well since she brought that up okay the garage sale you put out little signs that said do you need volunteers to help me put out signs I'm sure that is that his job your job a few times was it Wednesday before the Saturday um yeah we give the guys a map and they put them out okay because I'm just gonna say if it's something that volunteers could do and it allowed them to be doing something else more important that takes knowledge putting out a sign language in college excuse me thank you we drop a map for them okay yeah they don't serve quick okay I want to do it this time even participate okay number ten other business if you want to grab them up you know but we'd also need the map for that too knowing where they are I mean if it's okay with everybody what I think I'm going to do is include this in the notes again with the people who are doing everything the same calendar but I'm also going to include the garage sales in there just so we have them since it's kind of a city yeah it's a city thing yeah would you prefer me not to include it I just think it's better to have yeah and then there's no way we all know yeah okay okay any other business okay we have to come up with next month next month meeting time and it is September oh okay so I think we're doing Thursdays now but doing whatever works Tuesday and Thursday whatever works for people the most 21st yeah good for me okay first yeah okay that's okay at 9am no I said I have something at 9am but I think I can handle 9 A.M being over I'm gonna check with Tammy the 21st as well okay or 2 30. two-thirds of goods 2 30 okay with you I like the 230 times what okay well I'm gonna put it down for now um motion made to accept the 24 oh you have to say that Patty I'm sorry that's okay did you get an answer from it no I could wait though put this in my thing okay so is there a motion to make the meeting for When September 21st at 2 30.
