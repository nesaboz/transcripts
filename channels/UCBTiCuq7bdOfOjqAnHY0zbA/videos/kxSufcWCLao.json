    "transcript": "recall the meeting in order and we'll have a profile okay board member Brenda of buenasera here board member Rudy Davis Vice chair Hart McIntyre here chair JC info city manager Kyle wiesler here City attorney Randy Mora present Linda Fisher Forum palace here and Angela Berry was unable to attend okay let's take a look at the agenda I hear an approval of the agenda wants you to approve agenda second that was a favor okay motion passed through all the minutes February 1st have you had a chance to peruse him yes motion to approve the village [Applause] Brenda those in favor approved okay here we are reviewing the draft comprehensive plan hoping that there's no extra little things to be handed in before we start but we have Pages five to nine and we're slipped in my computer yesterday so I guess we should start with the beginning and go up to the new ones I don't see any problem with one to five or one one through four as anybody else in the room one one two four would Pages you're talking yes yes we've already gone over all this and what what you do flip just again for context as the chair stated you've gone through this but um what the difference between what we've done in the past and what we've done now is you are generally provided language Loosely you now have this in the form of an ordinance with the exhibits there too and you are approving this ordinance for it to be passed along um or you are determining whether to approve this ordinance to be passed along to the council for consideration on person second reading foreign [Applause] all right this question sure Linda starting with you um 1.1.7 is we said earlier is just signed by the governor um and progressives affordable housing affordable housing I assume starts with initial land costs and then build cost from there so as I see it affordable housing in our community once you pay for the land and the construction it's still beyond that of the average person that this bill is directed to try and ease access to would you concur with that I I concur I think your city is very unlikely to see any consequence of this new law this is this was Senate Bill 102 it's called the live local Act what it does is allows certain affordable housing developments to override your local comp plan and Land Development regulations they have to meet certain criteria they have to have at least 40 percent of their units be affordable and they have to be located on commercial industrial or mixed-use land if that if you get a development like that in your in any Community they are allowed to build to the highest density that's allowed anywhere within the jurisdiction regardless of what the land use says and the highest height within the jurisdiction within one mile or three stories whichever is taller so this new policy 1.1.7 that we put in there just acknowledges that that's what the law says the law says that these developments are allowed to overrule your your other compound policies but I agree that it's very unlikely that you'll see consequences in your scene I think it's desperately needed throughout the state when you think of the people that really need it like teachers and First Responders and others that aren't necessarily on a very high pay per grade especially in this state it's admirable but that came to be but I was just trying to put in context of do we need to worry about this yeah and and do you need to worry about it no but do you need to put a policy in your comp plan yes we have through this yeah in the remaining news so we have to acknowledge that to their policy could potentially affect us right and there's no choice in that correct and then she says really directed toward utilization of commercial or industrial property right commercial industrial or mixed-used land so so and forgive me because I'm still noon trying to understand all of this stuff if somebody came along and somehow managed to develop a commercial property here then then we would be subject to this is that what that's saying it has to be land that's designated for that purpose can that designation be changed because of this the designation can't be changed because of this but if if you have any land in a community that is zoned already for residential for excuse me for commercial or industrial or mixed use then somebody could utilize that so as long as we never end up with a commercial designation then theoretically so do we have protections that keep us from ever seeing something designated commercial you enjoy the ability you as a jurisdiction still enjoy some modicum of home rule and so so long as your jurisdiction does not willfully change its Land Development regulations it's not an issue for you your current code is adequate you only have a basically High residential and low residential designation and institutional which is really just for this property you don't have a commercial District you don't have an industrial district presently and you don't have a mixed use District presently should your Commissioners or elected officials in response to the will of your residents that sometimes change that this would take effect but presently it's not a concern in this community that way there's nothing on the map there doesn't seems anything that's refers to that those are not existing districts in your community that you need to be concerned about um well the the the mealy mouth lawyer answer I'm giving you is that that could change if the politics of this community change and the political will is to change the look of this community but in its and there's and I'm not saying that exists on your commission so all it would take really is some great big developer a whole bunch of money to come in here and buy stuff up on the beach and say we want to change that and and petition the commissioner or the the council to change competition doesn't grant them an entitlement no but they Money Talks Money Talks absolutely money talks and money money has always talked and as has you know tax dollars development dollars and promise of a new tomorrow I mean the music man is a musical for a reason right um so yes that possibility always exists but that's not in your present landscape that's not an issue beyond having to give a hat tip to the existence of this in your complex okay Rudy what just to touch the base the Bellaire Beach Motel that land is actually somewhat right now thinks the higher intensity residential residential media should be okay so it's not its own commercial you do not have a commercial Zone in the event it's not down there's no commercial zoning in the whole map right and then the event that it's knocked down our comprehensive plan says it has to be rebuilt as residential medium medium right correct but would that be affected by this no it wouldn't one other factor to keep in mind is this particular statute that's mentioned uh in the policy has been amended three times in the past three years the legislature keeps going in and making changes so if there should be a change to the statute that that does affect your community you'll at least be covered by this policy okay let's carry on we can recreate all kinds of situations we don't have to I would just add that the remaining pages that are attached to it this one policy I put it where I thought it should go and it bumped the numbers of all the other policies down so that's why we printed the additional pages I had a question on page seven of that and under policy 1.1.11 um and it's just everything I've put in here has to do with the word it's used and it says desires to maintain wait a minute we didn't get to Seven yeah we're a wonderful four okay I had that turned off Let's go Irish [Applause] Danville collectors more by my house anybody I want him every other day somebody wants to find my house we're settling right now with some semblance of order from one to five I don't want to jump to seven and six until we get there okay is everything acceptable from one to five pages um you know when you say one to five you need to move one out to one to eight because we're a change you know I want to change when it starts at five just five to nine it sort of changed right so before we send first four four spine okay let me nicely we'll accept the first the recommendation of accepting the first four so moved second that was in favor aye aye opposed so be it now five two the new insertion five to nine motion to approve please that that's one where I had a question oh yeah okay so before we motion I had a question the word desire doesn't mean we're committing to maintaining you just said well we kind of like to correct is that as strong as we can make it as strong as we want to make it where are we at page seven 1.1.11 should he recognize contribution dollar Beach Marina desires to maintain its usage you can say that it will be maintained as a marina but that might not be possible economically and um for the community that daring comes back to this other issue though if you don't have that now all of a sudden that opens it up for somebody to say all right let's do something commercially with it and then all of a sudden all this other stuff kicks in I have a question for clarification the Bellar Beach Marina is it owned by the city or is it owned by a private property property okay so the city can tie its own hands but it's probably not going to be what you're Council wants to do that's just not typically what cities do but what if it's what the people want to do well ultimately the council has to approve the the language we can make it say that if you want and then the console can modify it if they choose unless our attorney recommends against that legal verification legal verification I will tell you that the the aspirational language that is in here is more commonly the kind of language you would find placing an absolute limitation on the government is better than on a private property owner to be sure placing that limitation as a comp plan limitation you can certainly attempt to that if that's what the majority wishes you can make that recommendation to the council and they can determine whether they wish to proceed with that um this language is typically you would say that if somebody was doing something in in if the city was doing something that contravention of this you would raise this provision and make the political muck of it if you will for lack of a better term um but having it be so absolute it just government's not typically in the habit of binding its own hands is all so we do want to avoid absolutes as much as possible yeah in general like I'm an attorney I'm a relativist now absolutes don't account for the ways the world changes right all right absolutely can be changed overnight right okay any further discussions from are you okay yeah he's okay with it yeah or he just jumped up and down motion to accept the recommendations supplied to us on for Pages 539 although it should know any further discussion those in favor come on all right proposed so beer so moved okay now just carry on [Applause] I wish to continue on with page 10 and just peruse from 10 on to see if there's anything that we have to regurgitate regurgitate that's not the right thing reiterate change uh balance reverberate whatever you want to do with it when I get up now the next section is called the transportation level it's 10 through 15. I think it might be improvements to take these things as elements transportation and that's the one that probably is most concerning to us as a community because of the Transportation impact our community to the north let me just say first asked Linda do you think there's anything that well I'm not sure the person to ask for by partnering some growing concerns that um forward when I was part of the problem I think you figured that out already but um I am going to remain silent on that issue I'm going to remain silent on that issue probably for job security better to do that but is there anything I feel that you have some fiduciary relationship to us since we've hired you to come in and assist us in this process it may not be to the letter of the laws turning Lawrence pointed out to me but is there anything in that Transportation element that we could add in your opinion that would be a stronger statement as to their objections for what's happening and the increased traffic I've put in the best language that I can think of the strongest language because really your recourse as a community is to work with forward Pinellas and to work with your neighboring jurisdictions in Pinellas County and you're all joking about my agency aside that is the Avenue that you have and so we've put in a lot of policies about working with those agents those entities and looking for solutions for specific issues like residents not being able to merge onto Boulevard and looking for engineering solutions to potentially divert traffic or at least get the traffic to yield and this is the strongest language that I know of with the ability that you have and all I can recommend that you do is use the board pills Forum to Make Some Noise as a community so I would say that mayor status is I believe there's going to be a representative to that body in some form yeah or whatever yeah and that um the recently appointed new representative is from the Barrier Islands as well I believe that you might be referring to David will yeah um yes that's and he's from Remington Beach right okay all right um so what would you what would you put into this I mean would you want to put more onus back on Clearwater and and you know hey make your egress and Ingress no I I don't think through this comprehensive plan there's much at all we can do when I talked to the mayor about some other avenues to I'd let them bring up in this meeting because it may preempt some actions that we decide to take in the future um but let me just ask one quick question our comprehensive plan I keep reading things that we are kind of committing to and a lot of them are based on the hype Coastal High Hazard area and what the state envisioned as far as density and especially density and traffic and those kinds of things the Clearwater Beach have the same language in their comprehensive plan yes the difference is that they had a lot of unused density before they adopted that policy language before everyone was required to adopt that policy language so they are they have a big pool of unused density and they've just been moving it around to allow those larger developments I wish I could give you a more satisfying answer but that's that's what happened um pleasure said this particles other than what we have done here so um the fruit of the transportation discussing a transportation element is there anything under transportation on further on the river foreign no I I missed a step I wanted to ask Randy if he had the same opinion if we 've gone about as far as we can go with this Transportation element and finding some resolution to our issue as it relates to a comprehensive plan and the purpose and nature of a comprehensive plan I think by adopting the Amendments here you're making your position on Transportation clear I'm never going to tell a client if they've gone as far as they can go I'm shy of you've gone to the Supreme Court and you've lost um so I I won't issue I'm not going to hide on that so if not to me have that West at some later date but I'd say that this certainly captures the discourse in this body over the past few months and and the palpable frustration about Transportation issues um I think that's that that is found here perfect so I continued my motion to approve just one comment we did bring up that discussion about controlling the traffic over the bridges Etc and I want that to be known that the committee was concerned about that to the point of curtailing it somewhat we did discuss it because of the traffic on our Bridge things have if you've driven down Clearwater Harbor and along the Gulf you see more motels going up to where are these people going to go over our Bridge so it's not that we're avoiding this it's just we're Limited we did bring it up and we're very concerned about it does it come back to the density the amount of traffic flow over either of these Bridges is that the really the only control there is and bridges are designed for a certain amount of traffic and if it's exceeding it then it's an issue that has to be addressed but it looks at an average 724 instead of looking at a peak and saying the peak can't contain this it can't handle it how do we get them to look at it from a peak period rather than a 724. um it it is based on peak hour I'm gonna shift over to the data and Analysis because I did say something about that in here [Music] so this is what I wrote on page A5 one issue that has been noted is that the Barrier Island communities whose traffic is significantly comprised of tourists tend not to have the same peak hours as the majority in the county which are largely determined by weekday commuters while the same Am Pm peak hours are used county-wide for standardization purposes a local government can request that forward Pinellas conduct a special traffic study tailored to an individual roadway so that is something we talked about the data analysis that is not included as a policy but we could add a policy that says that if you choose we talked about this issue of requesting a special traffic study right we talked about it in the data and Analysis but we didn't put it in a policy which we could do if it's the will of this body yeah I would agree well and let me ask who determines loss um that is actually done by our agency as well but it's based on a formula so it's not anything that we have discretionary control over and that is also included in your data and Analysis um on starting on page A4 under the table on a page A4 we talk about what formulas in there yes volume over capacity volume of the roadway over the Riverside C I'm sorry for yourself capacity yeah capacity is is based on the number of lanes and the width of the lanes there's a an engineering formula that's used at standard Nationwide and then so the volume is the observed number of cars that are driving on the road and you divide the volume of cars by the capacity of the roadway and then based on the Range that it falls into that determines what the what the Los is and that that's spelled out at the request of you all I spelled that out very clearly in the data analysis we're ready to dance Boulevard is currently rated in what um it's an e F south of the cosmic e north of the cosplay F south of the consulate and Causeway Miller beach coastal yeah that makes sense of the alternative going on it's turned around yeah it should be it should be the other way around I can double check that but that's what I found in our Lewis report yeah it may just be that there's more capacity to the north but I will double check this okay I'll make sure that this double checked um on many occasions so we could add a policy saying that the city requests or the city shell request those special traffic study to account for The Unique Am Pm peak hour associated with communities that are relied on reliant on tourism over that better can you tie it to the Los saying this is the level that needs to be achieved as a resident here you wanted either an A or certainly nothing worse than a b that's right I'm sorry go ahead that's not something probably that's within the scope of a comprehensive plan and you can say that that's the desired level of service but there are probably not enough policies that you could put in your company to make that happen given the conditions that already exist let's go with the simple approach request to study no okay give me one second to write that down and then I'll read it to you all those in favor maybe you want to formulate that and four okay okay write it down and then go book of approval interesting can we make that I think the objective was this to be our last meeting time wise correct so can we accept this yeah subject to an amendment incorporating that absolutely your recommendation is to pass this ordinance on with a language revising to account for the requested study okay then that can be done okay [Music] well it was in favor of that situation yeah okay okay something like understanding the Barrier Island communities whose traffic is primarily composed of tourists tend not to have the same peak hour traffic as Mainland communities the city shall request a special traffic study for its principal roadways it's major roadways [Applause] she'll request a special traffic study from forward Pinellas for its major purpose um do you want to be specific what kind of study no uh Shane major do we read that one more time yeah or we could say for Bella Beach Causeway and Gulf Boulevard yeah okay any wording there Randy that you know I think Miss Fisher's got it in the way that she captured much of your revisions I think is an accurate in and accurate representation of everything that you've said so far okay and that will be policy 1.3.4 in the transportation element how does the city go about requesting procedure I will talk to our transportation person who told me that that's an option and I will find out from her what exactly you need to do should be in the form of 3.3.4 yes Transportation survey anyway we get a an updated change of those to this I'll have to write it down when I get home and then email it to you and you'll of course also be have a polar bears access to Commission counselencies thank you I'll entertain a motion division in fact solo any further discussion all those in favor aye opposed Carrie anything else under transportation and we'll proceed to housing element [Applause] foreign [Music] should be just page 15. 50 through 70. 15 is housing element and then 16 starts infrastructure right correct that's the best way yeah so housing y'all yes 15. any situation area changes made so a motion to approve 15 in this second are there any further discussion those in favor area infrastructure element on 16 17. um Kyle breathe comfortable with those numbers 2015 gallons on sanitary silver and purple water 115 gallons per capita per k yes um we wanted to just keep them she bumped them down if I remember and then we wanted to keep them where they're at right this is the County's adopted standard but this is much more generous than a typical than Swift Mud thinks you're going to need so you can't say Swift not no more it says Southwest Florida District I stand corrected any other discussion on infrastructure you entertain a motion recommend second any further discussion show Carrie yep social management conservation element s [Music] I think I'm looking at prices yeah I never end on page let's see page yeah on page 26 20 actually it's just a just a point we call it Bel Air Beach Marina facility it's not really a marine is it didn't it just docks do we well that's what they refer to as a marina because there's several dogs well I haven't been a boat or not maybe in as many years as you are but I've been listening if I had two I'd call the marina yeah it's not there's there's no there's no sanitary facility there there's no air on on the boats I know well what would you call it docks and I I but I'm just wondering if it's an issue if it's not an issue it's always just been always been okay [Music] it's an issue in as much as you want to across your documents have parallelism and so since in your code and otherwise it is referred to as the marina but that's the better that way it does you avoid the argument that while they use this word here and they use that word there so they must have meant those were different things I don't see any problem with it 23 and now I'm coming to the the absolutes you've got a lot of the city Shout and this is one of the big changes to state law that happened since the last time you updated your plan this is called the Peril of flood act and they do specify a number of absolutes that you have to include in your plan and I took the objectives or taken verbatim from the statue so we shall provide it if we look at objective 1.6 we shall provide a transportation system on page 23. okay that was language sorry I was skipping down to one the the new content objective 1.6 that wording was already included in your comp plan and I didn't change that is are we obligating ourselves by saying we shall provide transportation system and what defines Transportation well I was in the previous uh ordinances that they used the bus that was provided that runs up and down so there is a trend the city provides a transportation system it says through cooperation with Pinellas City shall provide mm-hmm I'm looking right now to see if Bella Beach is among the participating members of PSTA um I don't believe it is it's not a line memory and this is saying we shall provide you know that can be without speaking to um Miss Fisher's things I would say from where I sit looking at that language the transportation system in cooperation with the county could be construed to include your bike Lanes on your because it says that promotes Public Safety yeah your bike Lanes Coast Boulevard causeways those are all Transportation Systems your roadways uh clear and free roadways clear and free bypass clear and free you know those are multimodal Pathways those are means of transportation and transportation roadway systems weather transportation system is is defined elsewhere I don't know off the top of my head but I would say to answer the question more broadly and how would you construe this language it's not as a transportation system is not on its face be limited exclusively to we this is our pilot program where we provide this vehicle I'm I'm not posted I'm just trying to ask are we are we setting ourselves up yeah so do we want to put I.E bicycles and something behind transportation system well the context here is disaster preparedness um so the policy under that objective is about evacuation routes so then heart is he's totally right about what system are we providing is everybody going to be picked up and hauled out yeah that's the way I interpreted when I read it it's like oh we're going to provide this service and the same thing cities shall reduce the the risk of exposure of human life I can see somebody coming along going you didn't do that we're selling it Oh They'll sue you regardless I get it and I will tell you your Council can look at this and say all the ways that we do that that we would meet those kinds of objectives the the narrow conceptualization aside um again I'm looking here to see if transportation system is a narrowly defined term but in the context of the varying extended of the sub policy if you will say in coordinating with Pinellas County emo to ensure evacuation routes are posted that's that underscores the fact that a transportation system includes your roadways and so we do provide a transportation system and again I'm not trying to litigate or argue the matter if the language if the language is there and has historically been there and thus far has not presented a challenge let's observe what our existing circumstances are as to why that might be the case and so if our system is as simple like for example you have a system in place for giving people decals for returning to and from the beaches in advance of and following an emergency event that is a system in place a transportation system it regulates Transportation access immediately before and following a storm that could arguably be going within that Ambit again I'm not I'm not on the planner side a lawyer is going to look at this different than a planner but from a lawyer's perspective I don't I don't find that language particularly controversial knowing that these are bus stops no we don't no yeah we don't have bus stops as long as bus stops because the amount the PSTA I think called it was a minimum wanted to charge us for our two stops within a mile and a half or something was ridiculous and every no one uses it we all Drive the only people that might use it as a maid that comes and typically they come in their own car so we just opted out of it because of the cost to use ratio I don't have any heartburn about striking that objective I misspoke about the ones that you're required to include those start at objective 1.8 so 1.6 is an optional objective we could take that out and we could put that policy 1.6.1 somewhere else either under the previous objective or another place that talks more directly about evacuation um but I don't have a I don't have any heartbreak about deleting that objective but I'm deleting 1.6 all together correct if if that if there's concern that that's right where you want to put 1.6.1 yeah yeah and and again maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill transportation system but you know is it is it providing a an Ingress an egress process that provides Public Safety and Welfare uh so is that is it just for the record as far as Emergency Management the you know the city allows the county to have special needs registration for evacuation they work with the county and the um fire districts so there is a there is a registrative registration list where residents get on if they have special needs or need evacuation um assistance at one point six I suggest maybe 1.6.1 could go in as 1.5.8 I was going to make that same suggestion but I think that it would actually fit better under 1.3 so we can make that policy 1.3.7 since that talks directly about evacuation if that pleases the board so strike one six and eight one six one one point three point seven [Applause] and then the subsequent policies will all need to be renumbered subsequent objectives and policies since we're getting getting rid of 1.6 so we're eliminating not 1.6 is that the deal all those in favor of this all right okay I proposed so Carrie carry on please moving on to the next in the same situation in the same or we're still Within yeah transportation it's Coastal Coastal and conservation element I read this and reread it and I still don't object to anything in it thank you again with cardiac warrant if you have any concerns about North Coastal management conservation only no no legal concerns uh and it's a policy document and ultimately yeah regard [Music] well I hear a motion to accept the coastal management conservation element so move seconded any further discussion hearing none will proceed to Recreation and open space helmet just as an aside I often wonder why we could evacuate very simply three lanes going one way if there was a problem and then somebody put trees right in the middle of the road I never understood what the hell that meant hey we got three Lanes going out of the city and then somebody put trees in Highlands and everything that's been down the middle Lane that was always a hit scratcher to me [Music] it'll be removed by itself yeah I remember it being dumb but I don't think I was [Applause] do you remember the have any historical perspective on why they were put in was it part of Pinellas County's beautification I think it was Penny money the previous kind of three is when they were put in is that what it was having spent that opportunity to be limited now in taking them out we're not limited at all the the county has already said it's doable to remove our assets from the roadway that they would do it as well but it was left in the council meeting that we were having the county redo a study of the intersection especially over here with the 12th Street um and at that point look at the numbers and see what it shows before any consideration well she's just an observation from the chairman you know it's still we still have a one lane coming and going Bridge so I'm not sure what that would do other than what I do like is but then if you fill up the traffic emergency vehicles trying to get up and down the road to get to people or situations and get trapped or trapped by those things but if you fill it with traffic it's just as bad so I don't I'm not seeing this as a topic for us to get into well at least we can observe it yeah and we did yeah okay still remembering the mayor that had a little lady Patty that was mayor when I first moved here she had this beautification group we're gonna put oak trees in that little Park and I thought why they fill your pool with acorns but they're pretty I said not around here today well that got killed oh we will go on to Recreation and open space element cool two pages my golly not even two pages I had no situation while I'm ready motion to accept second all those in favor of opposed so Carrie intergovernmental coordination element according back back to the same thing transportation system what is a transportation system partner page 10 has a little definition way back in front under transportation sorry JC what is it going to it again so you're right bill I think in this case then it's not talking about any physical it's not a vehicle with any short you're right we're on intergovernmental limited to yeah okay that's a city manager have any comment about this section I do not okay or I am an attorney no I do not have any comment on the intergovernmental coordination [Music] [Applause] I always liked having goals and objectives I have no comment on this section at all most of you approved second all those in favor aye opposed private property rights capital one foreign [Applause] should be Capital Improvement sorry page 33 yes so the table on 34 is based off of the last budget of the past there's some changes should we update that at this point what is the Gulf Boulevard beautification that's underground it's not beautification then I mean it's not like we're gonna do more in the middle of the roads right okay thank you so should we update this yes if there have been changes that affect this I would say we don't need the exact wording today but if it's the understanding of the board that will update this table here where this stuff that I am so up what should I go over here page 34 page 34. foreign so yeah the generator project kind of fizzled out in the last in the last work session so I mean I thought we had a generator no we do not you know we used to have one and then we donated it to the Pinellas Suncoast Vlog before me uh we talked about it we did some different quotes side by side comparisons and the council kind of went around the table and so actually during an event the hurricane stabbed us and command this Center at all you I think you go to depend on the level it depends on the level of threat right so yeah we when storm surge looks to be to a certain point where we're evacuating the island then we're moving then remove equipment up so typically you say you don't need a generator or oh well there's definitely a level of storm surge where we'd have to turn it off yeah we wouldn't be able to run it if it was not a stand high enough built up to maybe what this building's at is uh 12 feet elevation I mean we could get a surge that's higher than that so if even if we put a generator at that that elevation it could be flooded we talked about having a portable I mean we'd have to trailer that to Higher Ground and then come back and it was kind of weighed out for the cost of the different options they thought we were looking at diesel option and it was a talk of like maintaining that large diesel fuel tank you know yearly and or Council of studying though sort of it was studied based on a cost Logistics maintenance and then as that storm water project we just um approved we did a resolution for a capital note for to complete five of the bmps that were scheduled out to 25 26 will have them scheduled for next year to begin Construction okay I liked page 35. everything's crushed off motion to approve next case [Applause] then we come to private property right this is another mandatory so and this language was taken from the statute for badam because of this just underline I mean this is a statement sorry no that's a new one it's in the last section of page 40. did we skip too far ahead that's uh we haven't done anything with capital Improvement so oh it's it's a section of its own that's right so I thought it was the last page no Capital Improvements element motion to approve cycling all those in favor aye aye motion character private property rights element this is uh the attorneys um as Miss Fisher was indicating a moment ago it is statutory required to have this language in understanding the members philosophical concerns about doesn't this undermine home rule private property rights have always existed this is a recitation recognition of that whether that is being used in a way to undermine home rules really more of a philosophical and political debate that continues with each legislative session and what home rule means and versus what event in 1968 and even 15 years ago were different things in some ways in terms of how it's being conceptualized but this is the language that if you did their own there are a handful of things in here that if you did nothing else you have to do this is one of this was adopted in the 2021 I believe legislative session you have to do this as you can it's one of the things that will get your proposed company amendments bounce back this is an easy check box that they look for and if it's not there basically go back in and do it right question to approve wait a minute I have one question yeah yeah you said the right of property owner to dispose of his or her property through sale or gift does that include wilts what's in a will um will is typically considered devised but it can be considered I mean it's it's donative so yes it's captured there and I would not even if they there's more precise language that could be added the fact that the legislature didn't add it I wouldn't go messing with it what the language here is a is a carbon copy of what the statute has and we're putting it there to mandate that I would not in other words carry on that's my advice I just give advice I just conduct a meeting all those in favor of private property rights elements [Music] the next batch is all the maps that I [Applause] diligently search for commercial property and I couldn't find any so these are just the support of what we've already improved right so we don't have to even address this so [Applause] potable water Etc also this is controlled by this County I had a question about the residential medium land use do what are you doing question about residential medium land use off the land use map future land use does that typically include the apartments motels timeshares um it can yes it's 15 units to the acre so that can include either single or multi-family development um Time Shares are kind of a gray area whether they're counted as a residential or or temporary lodging but since you don't allow temporary lodging you would either classify them as residential or they would be non-conforming okay or they would be vacation rentals but yeah somebody can use time share to affect the Airbnb type running the timeshare is a completely different legal um entity under four statutes it's a completely different definition uh what I can tell you is there is a the gray area of the law is always there right and so something we've started to see in California and even in some jurisdictions here is examples of multiple parties having legal ownership of a property and privately and among themselves agreeing to use that property like my family you and I buy the three of us buy together and I say I'm going to get it when the first weekend of every month you get it the second you get it the third and it operates pseudo like a timeshare but we are deeded owners who have property rights as we've recognized and if for one of those property rights is free and fair use of your property that's a more problematic challenge relative to the short-term rental landscape for local governments as they adapt but generally speaking a timeshare is a separate and distinct legal entity from a transient lodging establishment or short-term rentals that Scott's often typically referred to as and the remaining data analysis sheets is there anything that the board constitute discuss whatsoever an entertain a motion to accept the message should we hear from anybody he never said anything so I'm just let it go with that the word spoke everyone you want to speak I had a couple comments okay I didn't want to bother you JC okay so you had your answer on the transportation system there is some definition in there it really is Broad term it is yeah thanks for answering that Ruby I never knew why we didn't have a stop or two of the buses the beautification is interesting as you're communicating with Council and this continuous studies and traffic comes up I think it's really important to know where everyone except growth is here growth is going to continue to expand and it is possible through incremental studies removal of a tree whatever it may be we can keep doing things that will help I'm going to give you an example just as a resident with knowledge when I was at the easement one night during peak times of traffic and I was it was purposeful I wanted to go down there and just observe what's backing up why took my bike up to the Gulf Boulevard came out of the parking lot another gentleman did the same with his chair looked like a visitor and I was purposeful of not going to the crosswalk while traffic was flowing that individual looked at me like I was Dumb and didn't know where the button was and just stopped traffic if he would have waited five minutes until the light went red traffic would have stopped naturally so it's those little things that everywhere you look we can do a little bit better even as residents and how we're looking at it that'll be interesting on Lanes middle Lanes can we potentially use them at some point and have signs where maybe we are directing individuals that the Middle Lane is open to the turning lane farther if the tree is removed and signs should say be aware there are residents that need to come out so again the little things I think we can do better we're not going to get rid of traffic so keep that in mind Airbnb was interesting discussion I don't know where it's going to come here or not but we have to also be aware that the problems are not always the renters the problems are the owners of the property and maybe there's process around that as you're working with Council if it ever needs the address that there's something they can do differently whether it's how they interview how they improve who are their guests how long whatever but I've learned that as as family owns property in this way in different states and cities that it really comes down to the owner not always for the Redding to just keep that in mind I know that I had the last one for you Kyle was what you went through this process did you do you see the changes that are going to give you a better guide is there anything missing for you that you would have wanted to see changed it just didn't come up I think as we talked it all through I think there was a lot of ballot points on what we wanted like some problems that exist and what we wanted to see change but I think in this process I I there's only so far we can take right right so but reflecting back um definitely put just by reviewing this comp plan the overall moving forward future the city vision and perspective okay summing it all up and and we talked about nil looking through our codes and doing more code review and I think this is a good first step and all that awesome took overall good exercise not necessarily yes changes okay well thank you and thanks Jason you're quite welcome and that triggered something that I was thinking of it somehow or another there could be some signage along the road saying please yield to residents trying to get out during the peak times you can't get out we'll take away the little lane and said there was a bit I jumped into that Middle Lane and there's a tree another problem but if there is something that uh coming from the board say hey think of the resonance they can't get out of their driveway can't get off their streets on the Gulf Boulevard and that triggered me that was right that's why I'm here please think of that as city manager there was a major accident on a medium down in Sand Key uh did you hear about that yeah well I mean I think one of these I I shouldn't have said someone some idiot let me just sum it all up under that decided they were going to go Middle Lane to pass and you know that's typical of these out of statements whatever and so they went right over the two trees and right over I don't know what happened who was that again but I was leaving from downtown Clearwater coming back and just lights everywhere two trees down you can go down and see the medium now doesn't have trees in it in Sinking so I've seen that yeah did you see that yeah wow I don't know what happened to the person I would like to ask Patty if there is a there are not a reason for another meeting us or can we recommend from this point that has modified that it go to this Cal City Council for their approval Randy so when the modifies it yes um I would say that when you what you you've already because of the way you went through it and you uh did piecemeal consensus each time you voted on this moving forward subject to whatever Direction we've given thus far such as updating the numbers on the chart for the budget and otherwise so this is your final hearing as it relates to the comp plan it will go now to the city council there's this very fun back and forth Waltz they do from here to the state to another agency within the state then back to us and it goes up again it's not a normal first and second reading process like you see but yes we have everything we need from this body and we've noticed things Etc such that we are prepared to move forward with all the requisite advertisements and hearings as chairman I would like to recommend I know I'd like to make a motion that a unanimous acceptance as changed to our formal vote be presented to council for their approval of the comprehensive plan and I as chairman make the motion to the board second Ed by the co-chairman is there any further discussion for the board hearing none I will call for a vote all those in favor aye opposed thank you very much for your cooperation it's been a long arduous meetings and especially thanks to you and Patty for putting up with all this foolishness and the brains we picked and the representative from the citizenry which is very important to me and should be in Patty's diligence and do not answer everybody just answer me I will call this meeting adjourned and thank my members I can't believe there's another item on your agenda Mr chair where on the review General draft ordinance what the view of the draft ordinance no that was the that was the order that was included yeah that was the final pages of all of this and so okay I touched every base yes branslet I formally declare this meeting adjourned and I'm very reluctant to say that it was Rudy's last meeting his consented to stay on so that means there's a vacancy on my committee for the first time in 10 years 15 Patty I don't remember yeah there's been so many mayors and people done but I want to formally thank her thank you rude in 30 years for his service done no you have just begun the mind is so good and I want to as chairman and friend well thank you very much for the city for the service and for your help I declare this meeting formally closed and then I had a question for you the"
