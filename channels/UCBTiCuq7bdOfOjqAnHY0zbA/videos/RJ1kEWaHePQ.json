    "transcript": "all right so we'll call the leading order and i guess the first action is to approve the agenda and get a second second i should say this is a meeting of the city of valor beach audit committee meeting monday june 13th at five o'clock so we have um a motion and a second all in favor all right any opposed okay the agenda is passed so we're going to the point number two to review and accept the annual comprehensive financial report known as acfr for the fiscal year ended september 30th 2021. anybody have any questions on the audit well to john's point didn't we didn't the city of norfolk vote on this was that yeah the city council approved the draft which was wrong okay hey so the the draft was approved by city council before it was reviewed it's improved yes the the challenge is salt marsh got the uh draft completed into the city the day before the agenda had to go out and it had to be has to be approved uh this month yeah um i think it's within nine months of the fiscal year end and so it had to be approved in the june um june meeting so this that was the only meeting otherwise we would have to do a special counsel meeting just to approve that and they had the wrong data so one of the dates was to john's comment on why we were approving the fiscal year in a 9 30 2019. it was a typo on the agenda for the city council meeting it got corrected in council yeah it's just a type of it wasn't 2021. so i don't know if anybody went through the audit had any questions i did catch something that i emailed to patty and it was just it was a schedule so the first you know the the balance sheet the income statement what by the way the city finished the year nearly eight hundred thousand i had a bun of uh changing that position you know budgets are normally for a break even you know 400 000 of that plus was driven by the the monies we got from the federal government that to be expensed this next year but on page 69 of the audit um and i don't everybody doesn't have the audit but it was it was it was just there was a schedule about prior year millage rates and so they had 2016 through 2012 that the city millage was at 2.3094 lynn responded to me in a phone call that you know that's why this is a draft so they've already reached out to salt marsh to correct that i should have weighed in then because on page 42 it talks there's a line that says deficiency of revenues under expenditures and it's actually the opposite of efficiency it should say excess revenues over expenditures i believe i'm page 40 well it's 42 on my my oh shoot so there's like 20 pages off it's 20 pages up that was just when i go online and look at the report it would have been page 42 i don't know what page of the direct i could retain it if you'd like me to it's not a big deal it's just is it this page no no i can tell i used to audit cities and if i might weigh in this is ridiculous i want mistakes i mean it's just period and a story yeah it shouldn't well uh they had a change in staff and so whatever yeah okay do you want me to find it okay well you can continue the only other thing i had a question why do we show that principal taxpayers from 2021 2012. i don't i don't change in it no the the top taxpayers in the city they have scheduled who's yeah yeah it's a yeah is the purpose of that schedule yeah or to show i don't think it's really going to name anybody else no but no but it does it definitely does but just to show change in values over time regardless of whose property it is it gives us an idea of where we were before and where we are today which is uh i mean it's nice but it's interesting if you see down about halfway it says deficiency of revenues over and if you look revenues are more than expenditures if i'm reading it correctly what page are we on so this is page 23 of the audit [Applause] yeah excess of revenues efficiency of revenues under expenditure i mean i don't even know if it's grammatically correct what they're saying but it doesn't matter it's it it's not a huge thing so i mean i guess the question is if it was a deficiency would they have done in parentheses yes i guess yeah because there is a there is a fund where there is a negative where the expenditures are more than the revenues and they go deficiency of rep maybe of revenues over expenditures something like that which was correct from that scale yeah this is it should say excess revenues over expenditure or deficiency of rev uh yeah excess revenues over expenditure perfect that's what it should say so page 23 john okay so deficiency of revenue efficiency of revenues under expenses expenditures should say um excess excess excess of revenues over expenditures correct okay okay got it so it was a negative number no it's a positive one no it's a positive area this is measuring uh budget original budget the final budget to actual okay all right anybody else any other questions can i get a motion to accept i'll make a motion to accept with the two noted changes okay the one on page 23 and the one on 869. [Applause] what are they what is proper they can come back and send us some memorandum of correction or something that we include with it i think what happens do we kyle the city will communicate to salt marsh yeah and then they'll either agree with them and change it and then in the final when the final gets published then it'll be correct motion passes and then general business open up for discussion i know this is the audit committee but do we want to also call the finance committee and put john's concerns do we need to address the overall or recommend council address a master um do you know we have a master storm your plant well we do have a master stormwater plan i think the challenge is it's dated so the the projections that we for having for costs for costs yeah so i think that is really um it's a part of the responsibility of the city team to make sure that anything we're not only contemplating approving discussing or recommending that we have a pretty current set of costs so that we we aren't dealing with old numbers when we go yeah this is good for us to do maybe we ought to set maybe there should be something in the city code that says it's standard to review old plans for expenditures every three years or whatever it is i think the challenges is right the budget was set at the 500 000 number for that yeah and that's something that's put in the budget and then when they got the actual bids it was yeah and they were reviewed in 2019 after the plan was done in 2016. yeah so it is every three years it sounds like yeah so but how do we account for unusual times such as this while when we're talking about what our recommendations are for moving forward with a project or with a plan we should know we should proactively be looking at those things before we're faced with or or is it do we feel do we feel at any point in time structure price are going to come down is concrete and steel going down or it could be a comment about that i mean or do we as labor cards do we as a you know finance committee say let's look at the entire projects that are still on yeah how many open projects do we have do we need to are they impacted we need to do a bond issue and just get it done with and pay them off over the next three years that's that would be one way i think that's something you suggested yeah a while back i i would be in favor of that rather than peace i mean i mean there are some people probably council members leslie that would say oh we need to go back and re-calculate everything and re-bid everything my point would be if that is the is the recommendation of the council to do or they vote to do that i'm not sure i'm in favor of that but i would recommend that they put an inflation factor into their costs if they're going out years because that's what's happened here right 12th and 13th street which is budgeted at five 500 520 and now it's 717 or something nobody thought the cost would go up that much but we're talking about a report that is how many years old six years old is that correct six years on the report yeah three years they did another update to the cost oh okay well three years and costs have gone up so i like the bond issue thing but just get it done with yeah but john's comments i read i read your email which i really respected was that you didn't say it but it's almost like they're kicking the can down the road again or or seem to be and i don't want to put words in anybody's mouth well would i yeah but what i had said before you came in john was you know i got to some point yeah partially kick the can down the road but put a screech halt on it just slam the brakes on and stop because one of the arguments that lloyd made lloyd roberts made during his comments was the reinforced concrete is going to last indefinitely supposedly he didn't see the rationale for going to the larger pike well at the time i wasn't sure about it so right after the meeting adjourned i went to lynn and i said okay the old system what's the inside diameter of the pipe he said 10 inches i said what do we upgraded to 18 so it's going to take accept more volume so you're going to do half of the city and leave the other half of the city in the old way and part of my thought what process was sitting there listening to that was okay i didn't even think about a bond issue but go back and look at the strategic plan about the storm system and if the costs are going to be where we're at now and maybe go higher maybe we can't do two streets every fiscal year we may have to stretch it out a little bit further we're because now you're you're literally at the higher end of the city so maybe we can afford to a point to do one street in a year whatever um or like you said maybe the bond issue but before we do a bond issue we got to know cost so i think the recommendation is that they relook this and factor in higher than projected inflation for the coming years and look at all the options look at the bond option and doing it all look at the option you've got slowing the project down right look at all those options so um i have a curiosity question that you may know ron if you had about let's say the total cost i'm just picking a number to finish the streets was four million dollars and you did a bond issue for four million dollars and you wanted to get it done and let's say you could find a contractor contractors and get done in two years and they come in it total after two years at three million five you have 500 000 of excess bond proceeds what do you do with that money uh [Music] yeah they're back or if it wasn't needed then the city council had another project then they would have to get approval from the citizens to get a vote of the citizens no i don't know either but i would think that to get a bond a child the citizens have to approve any debt yeah i believe they do i don't know i think about a bond issue because for example like underground everybody affected had to there you know we all had no idea yeah when we when we did the storm water feed when we we sat here and um approved that um had to put it down about it yeah so this sort of issue the citizen is going to have to vote on something that's significant until you can pay it back or like you said it could be diverted to an existing another project that's kind of where we are too right so you get it set up it's interest only for a couple years this has paid off in 2026 and so payments will kick in when these payments go away you could bridge it and then the building would still be you know free and clear so i guess so how would we want to just put a comment in general business you want to do it under general business because we've got minutes here or a forum sheet for the advisory committee because we're supposed to do the discuss these uh score sheets for whatever reason we could put this information we're talking about under general business here that's true okay so then do i need a motion to adjourn the audit committee meeting yeah i shall move second you can't say so move you have to say what the motion is i move that we adjourn the auto committee meeting if that's correct and john you said yes all favor all right any foes"
