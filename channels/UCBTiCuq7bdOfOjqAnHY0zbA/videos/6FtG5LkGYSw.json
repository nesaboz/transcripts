geoengineering and its effect on clean air I'm providing the two-page explanation of this tourist City you can get a copy from a city portrait I am advocating for clean air above all without all of us breathing all projects at Miller Beach become worthless we won't be here I could not get this information to you in three minutes a lot of those who press the copy why is it important to understand how Geo engineering global warming and globalist goals are affecting our air to recover our health and the health of our planet many of you may not know that it will take three years for only particular amount of dispersed into our atmosphere for chemical aerial dispersion or geoengineering to settle to Europe if all geoengineering has stopped immediately you may also be surprised you know that we had three major volcanic eruptions within the last two weeks March 28th and probably have probably been getting March 27th in Japan and currently an ongoing volcano invented preventative these natural eruptions and also cause sulfur dioxide spinning around the atmosphere for approximately one and a half years sulfur dioxide is also used in geoengineering to do this unemployed planning but geoengineering plus natural diffusion of sulfur dioxide in our atmosphere through volcanoes will cause greater dimming of the cell causing even lower temperatures roadwise leading to food production failure undulations in temperature and humidity will Fast Track crop failures and food shortages as plants struggle to survive please look at the website about 2030 that'll give a lot of good information on this information is more important now than ever to stop Geo engineering we are more fortunate than most States and that we only have our northern border shared with other states if we stop aerial dispersions now most of our state can start healing quicker in Most states that are than those states that have been involved global warming is a far explanation we are on the solar Max of our 11-year solar cycle we have five more years of warmth before we head into a normal natural cooling slow recycle watch the weaponizing of these lies propaganda coming your way to cover crop failures with Global Employment now that the Earth will be cooling faster than expect please review the references I provided in the speech these were items I was going to talk about and we'll have to

that the only documented activity is one assault which was domestic related under arrest there was only one subject rested within the city and that was for a warrant under Deputy activity you can see there were a total of 649 events in the city leaving that as always the record controls traffic enforcement and parking enforcement okay next there was one crash within the city that occurred at Gulf and Causeway and I will Circle back to that there were a total of 147 citations and warnings issued touching on the crash that was at Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard last month if you'll remember I was asked whether or not if I determine the causation of that crash at that particular intersection I did look it up and it looks like it was distracted driving it was a three vehicle crash they were trying to turn north coming from westbound on Causeway to turn north on golf and the last vehicle in line struck the vehicle in front which suspended struck the vehicle in front other than that that is it thank you Sergeant do we have any questions or comments from the council thank you very much thank you all right next up show the enforcement before good evening Deputy Steve Gladway for the record um Commissioners mayor again we had another active month with some of these code enforcement violations as you can see on your sheets that the biggest one we're still having a problem with is the deal with contractors permits and unlicensed individuals there's still a few of them that I am following up on through the building department along with the construction licensing board the other event that we had was the short-term rental just this past week we had a hearing again on two different violations of the same residence and we have another one coming up in this Thursday

evening thank you very much thank you all right next up we have the presentation from a Pinellas Sun Coast fire and arrest rescue District that'll be cheap tables good evening everyone I wanted to give you the most important thing with at the fundraiser the kayak lunch fundraiser and we've had a great time I'm glad to see that they raised the money that they gave me for that but it was a great time thank you very much in the month of April we had 15 calls for emergency services into Belair Beach I know that I talked to you before that I'm working diligently on getting an additional fire department unit that's fully staff fully funded by the county I had no additional cost to our taxpayers these taxpayers are already paid that money and I'm asking for the economy to fund that unit and my plan is to move truck to be here closer here the Service Bel Air Vis so I had one meeting last week with the county I had one tomorrow and one at the end of May and I really urge you to write to your msac committee Emergency Services advisory Council and right to your County Commissioners budget decisions and it gets pushed up to the County Commissioners and this enhancement is a dire need to better serve our communities so I urge you to do that on June 8th 2023 we are hosting right here Bellaire Beach we're hosting a hurricane and water safety Expo we should have a fire in front of you but there's some flyers in the back there as well and it's June 8 2023 from 1 to 6 p.m we'll have some vendors here they're going to do life jacket giveaways Beach and broke safety information to meet your local firefighters there'll be a couple of meteorologists one from Channel 10 Tampa Bay and one from big news nine and the vanilla Suncoast professional firefighters Union will be hosting a cookout down here until supplies last and I guess they'd be very you know burgers and hot dogs and things like that and we're also planning to do a demonstration with our fire boat here our main Rescue Unit um and that is scheduled for 2 30. but the schedule's on the back of the flyer there's a up on the table there and we hope that have a great day with you all thank you if we have any questions or comments for cheap players the council is very quiet tonight I I have a life of yes it's way down here on the end boy Roberts so just a quick question on the um the cookout is it well that started that's very important to me when I started one o'clock or email I do not know that part is sponsored by the union okay okay but I'll make sure I find out any any special requests like what time you like to eat there sir um not really just continuously all right continuous all right well it says while supplies last but I will find out exactly what what time they're going to cook out thank you all right and you can see we're counseling somewhere in parlays right I did have a couple of questions for you this morning there was a golf cart somehow caught on fire because first off do you know anything about how that fire started and it's a two-part question and then the second part I noticed that the truck was coming from Largo that came service that required so can you give us some details yes I can so that was just after eight o'clock this morning it was in the 24th Avenue in Rocks Beach in Northern end and the call came in it's just a golf cart smoking and it was I was actually driving in and I thought it was a lot more than a golf bar on Fires you know a lot of thick black smoke pouring across them and until we until we decide what's you know determined what's on fire and we asked for more for more peoples it was like obviously you're building a lot of times Vehicles will catch apart inside a garage or next to another car things like that so um but that so I was the first one there something I just happened to be on the road the engine from Station 27 their first due to that area but they were out so the second thing to that area is Clearwater is 44 it's a on Santee so they were coming and I was about a half a mile away I could see so much black smoke which was an indicator there's a something burning um that I'd ask for additional units and they dispatched the rest of the units as if we were responding to a structure fire which is a total of 15 more people um so that might be what you saw when when Barca was coming across the bridge was on that fire response but then when I got there I could see it was uh the golf cart that was fully involved it caught the power pole on fire I mean we call the power company outside make sure the full safe and everything but um as far as the cause hasn't been determined most likely it was from somewhere in the batteries there you know a charging issue it wasn't plugged in it was just sitting there and you know public beach access somebody to put it in there sure is it electric or gas no that was battery out right all right the only other uh comment I have or actually request is I noticed that you gave us some statistics on emergency services that were provided and for Studio lrp is there any way that you could maybe provide us for those like be able to absolutely one that we said we can kind of load them over I think we normally our meetings here on Monday and we shut down incoming documentation for the agendas on Wednesday absolutely appreciate it and I'm happy to share that with you and happy to explain everything how they come up with those numbers and what everything means right many other questions or comments for the party all right thank you very much thank you okay next is okay we were expecting a presentation from the Pinellas County Metropolitan planning organization membership we unfortunate enough for them with one okay what I'm going to request is that we we table this one and bring it back up if the difference in the Haywood Council all right items six presentation um where is the presentation yeah yeah Kyle is going to accept it yeah that was a good thing yeah Heather is not very much you know I don't have a actual that will work all right I'd like a city manager reefer to make me a donations [Music] so what I have here is an award a financial reporting achievement and it's presented to the finest Department city of lrh by the government financing officers of Association of the United States and Canada uh we're doing everything right and uh we're not failing any audits we're doing everything to a standard that's the highest standard you can get for me so so congratulations to city manager reefer and in the rest of the city staff and our accounting department [Music] all right Island Seven city attorney's report Mr Mori you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor good evening all of you as far as legal updates we'll start with the legislative session we have about four days left of the legislative session and hopefully be in a little less test at least for me uh for for continuing to monitor a number of pieces of legislation I emailed you this weekend about Senate Bill 774 on the financial disclosures I'm not totally clear how to read the where that is on the Senate side it automatically passed the Senate house corollary it says that there's an indication that was laid on the table um but then it says referencing uh reference that Senate Bill substitute so I can't tell if that means when something's laid on the table for the housing is it's equivalent to voting it down especially at this stage in the legislature I can't tell if they're saying the house version has been laid on the table and we're now receiving on the substitute where if the house isn't moving on this it'd be kind of surprising for how overwhelmingly it passed in the Senate to not see something in the house I suspect it's the former as I advise over the weekend that they're just received on the set version but I will of course let you know continuing to track that another bill that was of interest to one of the members here specifically was Senate Bill 154 in this house corollary 1395 on the condo bills and that was the condo inspections and sort of depending on how you look at that making it more flexible in light of the different needs the condominating communities across the state that has been laid on the table in the house it doesn't look like that'll be passing this session one bill that's gained a lot of attention in this immediate area is set until 714 Senegal 714 has to do with the regulation of short-term rentals um it passed how past the Senate late last week Senate Bill 714 makes it it is being characterized publicly as giving tools to local governments to regulate short-term rentals my I think I spoke to this at some like last month I would say that anything different than you have vulnerable powers for everything except these three things we already had a depression we have those tools we don't really miss and once you start listing them it suggests that anything else is off the table it did pass the Senate it is going before the house if it's going it is it is in messages to the house the house is not here today that I'm aware of though we're still tracking the session so you know things can change from this moment um that bill is of less import here I don't want to get everybody freaked out you have regulations and restrictions for short-term rentals and pre-date June of 2011 which is a magic take in this legal version and and the reason that magic did exist it dates back to they passed the first version of this preemption in the 2011 session and said as long as you don't as long as it exists before June 2011 you can keep and they've kept that call instruct there have been a few efforts over the years to say to even take that away that did not come up this session so it shouldn't be a terrible impact here as long as we don't tinkering with our search and Rental restrictions but you can see that the concerns of a lot of your other Beach communities that may not be and that local communities across the border that may not be in that same position um as indicated this bill passed the Senate there was a strong indication during the session during winter pass the Senate leadership where leadership is supported something it seems more indicative than it's likely to pass especially again given the numbers this session with one party being in power and the governor being with that same party it seems especially now that there's a push a lot the front end the first month of session has been publicly characterized as the legislature largely passing much of the governor's requests and initiatives legislatively this last two or three weeks has been the legislature playing catch up and getting their issues out even if something passes the house and the Senate as you will know it still needs to go to your signature I'm not sure he hasn't articulated anything that he would explicitly be detailing this session that doesn't mean you won't do it we just don't know where those things are all that to say we will session ends Friday we'll we'll know better at least what has the possibility of being signed there is not a hard timeline it's this weird thing once they pass the house instead of they go to the governor's desk he doesn't have to sign them all by like May 15th or June 1st last year we were waiting in July to see some things would be signed and in fact I remember talking to ever surely while I was at a continuing education course we were saying at that course we're still waiting to see if he's going to sign some bill so it is entirely possible that after session ends will still there will still be a little bit of a guessing game on where things are going to lie but given the governor's Current public profile that seems he's going to be eager to show that he's getting fixed on moving their moving along or a few bills signs recently as this afternoon so that's where we stand on the legislative session uh something that has been brought up either in my report or otherwise over the last few months as a matter of the property with the radium antenna tower I I exchanged correspondence with their attorney uh just this afternoon uh at the on April 13th he sent some correspondence indicating he intended to have it done by the end of the month today being May first I said you know we have a paid in code enforcement in my in Reliance on this where do you stand and say it'll be submitted Wednesday it was a technical issue given the volume of a document and transmitting it it's going to have a propagation study if DTE says it should be roughly eight pages of submission so hopefully it won't be a you know a hand-drawn thing in two sheets of paper and of course the staff will have to review them and make sure that it you know see what I just can't speak to what the result of that because it has to go to review and that is where we stand we should have that submission this week likely by Wednesday other than that um I'm happy to answer any questions you have I don't have anything else that um Council all right I just want to thank you for pushing that issue in the uh that you've got now for over a year and I did some research on myself I can't find any of those Towers he's been resistant over 90 miles per hour I'm not there to look at the current version right there I would appreciate you keeping my mission I hope that both people as well and I know you sent some information to that effect and of course we will look to that as a resource as a staff conducts its reviews on its behalf of documents that you're made for all the questions that there are opinion any other questions or comments City attorney I appreciate all the updates it sort of looks like Belair Beach is uh it's in the morning as far as the thinking short-term rentals and [Music] and little families here and there that are in a position like we are where we're in our grandfathering but whenever I have various meetings around the county I I think you're in the minority based on your posture and you're having some kind you know having that grandfather protection because again that industry really emerged began to emerge airbnb's pilot programs I believe was the Democratic National Convention I have a fee from apart from a few trade shows back in 2008 and so you know that was really a nascent industry and government doesn't typically respond to Tech that quickly that is to say that yes you there are not a lot of communities outside of unless you were like in Key West where this is your old industry and you have trained to regulate this but I think you're in the majority of Florida who don't understand why you're being told how to regulate your local community and being told that however you should do that whether it's Solutions or otherwise that that should be defined by the state you know and I think that there's been the history of Florida and humble going back to 1968 and the character that has developed Community to community community to community throughout the state it's the reason why Anna Maria is different than Bella Beach is different than Juno Beach that's how that evolves but once you make those uniform regulations it makes it a lot more difficult for this place to have quite a charm in this place to be where you go for the resort and so I think you're the majority of state of cities and or municipalities who would just wish to preserve a status quo of being able to regulate as we see that consider 7 14. Faith instead of a solution I'm sorry what I consider it what was the verb debate um sorry that term invoked something else in my mind um I would say that I would consider 714 to be masturbating as something as well fair enough that's all I have thank you very much all right let's move on to Highway let's see [Music] America I'll start off with the underground new project that as you've probably seen we have a whole bunch of conduit roles and condiment like at the city marina on the southern end they're trying to tuck it away for the storage of the project we have all the materials that were set for the orange accomplishes actually what the majority of things to be installed on the project uh kind of correspondence with the official declaration ability so what they will be starting not so long too so that's that's exciting because once we have the material that I only get going to be moved through them really quickly um the stormwater Improvement projects uh it was the last meeting we got the note approved to cover the remaining bmps of the stormwater master plan that is a dependent item that is on the regular agenda the children's playground replacement um as you can see it's been removed the old playground we actually received 300 for it later on this company usually give us a check uh it was good that we removed it because the support a whole lot of repair rusting and those could be utilized so they did give us some money for what it was worth for them the new playground should be come in this week and it has a and so it's a solar system receive the delivery and they should kind of get it in pretty quickly so fun to get that done um Personnel policy account in that bag from consultant to do with some some review and it's answering some questions and then I will pass it along to legal firm to to review to make sure it's uh where it needs to be as far as employment logos Grant policy that was on the city manager's goals I would like to bring it to the next work session we're going to add administrative policy to get council state but on that as a reminder I have the fccma conference to attend Liberty Memorial Day week I wish it's Tuesday through Thursday so let's make 30th through June 2nd um some other notes I made we installed the park mobile system and it's operational of during the transition period but we shut down the meters of the physical meters and put some signs on it the direct customers could use part mobile and the uh the big building I was on a Wednesday and then the first week and we actually we did over four thousand dollars worth of sales so people are using it um the first two weeks I recommended to the deputies that we do not take it if they have not paid for all the cards that was provided an apartment um to give them a warning and give them give them a how-to want a car to you know to ease the transition so last week was to make an example I try to pull numbers on that too I believe about 400 put them in the letter um explainable so um the staff actually started to remove physical features today for a little slab just like bring yourself really fit for the sort of trying to do more Creative Solutions without not in there but I've been in contact of the Florida's company that we bought those from and hopefully it was sold back figured some money review um the arpa money we did our first report and we reported the use of this 7000 or 753 000 of the 802 damage 2000 so that has been reported the remaining money will go towards a better get more expenses if you have in a smaller account but just to let you know that that it has been reported because we have to use um the city with the help of the citizens advisory uh committee chair Ron saganic is entertaining switching banks to Valley which is over the bridge if you're familiar with the whole other gas station on the left they're offering uh 50 bonus points of their target prevent funds for the interest which is much better than getting from choice to reference currently with and they're also are not going to charge us any any banking fees uh we currently you know on a monthly basis you know 100 200 worth of fees so Heather and I are going to go to the branch and meet with them on Friday with other be asking for signature cards from you guys to the big tracks your own words and we'll do it over time so that uh we have a consultant in both places and uh Heather is working on putting the budget together to deliver back to me leave our calendars so through the 12th or the 13th but I'd like once I have a budget um to distribute it to you guys and it has some meetings one-on-ones the talk talk it over what I'm planning on be able to see here before we have for that thanks for the detailed report my questions your comments I should say is there a second page to the city manager who's reported very good okay there's no second page of stuff okay interested was just sort of off yeah um Park Mobile I didn't put it as an actual project man it was just some more reporting okay good questions he increased is it supposed to I thought it was supposed to go into effect like midnight or 1201 A.M uh five dollars and ten dollars an hour was that said no that was that was set my resolution right so when uh when we made the transition Department set up with the new fees we have the second reading of the fines recordings thank you so that if passes tonight will be in effect and then my plan was to actually started taking this week after that course I guess a simple question is variety after I forget the hours of Australia ten dollars it was a state oh excited the rate change um that is weekends and holidays so Friday is five dollars an hour and then Saturday Sunday and holidays if it's just a post here and pick up a quote Friday night function again it was still five dollars I thought it was I thought it was foreign [Music] this is just a quick free half of April um it seems like so long ago the city yard sale that was you know pretty went out really well City attorney Moore I gave this government the sunshine which that was well attended that people were thankful for that we had a flood insurance Workshop that gave up updates on flood insurance here at in the council chambers the mayor and Council gave their luncheon to thank God lord and King and Foundation members and the too many members of the foundation and the board today we're all very appreciative and they were very appreciate they expressed that and the audit committee annual comprehensive financial report would find only on that should be labored they hope that that will be there for my home meeting and then the Planning and Zoning comprehensive plan review their final meeting will probably be the nine and yeah that's not okay any questions or comments for the safer right thank you very much Mrs Fisher I appreciate it all right right up next is item 10. and this is consideration of ordinance 23-02 which is the second Queen Mr Moore thank you Mr Mayor says ordinance 23-02 an ordinance of the city council the city of Bella Beach Florida many section 58-38 finds a procedure to increase the funds associated with parking violations provided for codification severability and for an effective date this has been a second and final rating or if it's 23-02 by Title 1 thank you Mr Aurora before we go to the council okay with citizens okay the citizen comments are closed until we open discussion I'm going to be in a motion to a 23-1 should made by Frank Baker who I have a second by Leslie metaro Mr Banker Governor voice daily during the first reading I stated that the current client is only 35 dollars and I just noted that we can raise important fees I thought it was a price to do with the ten dollars per hour so it made no sense 35 hours it's important all day 35 hours our time in Dallas maybe three hours so even though the Flyers are still a little bit low in my opinion when I I don't description Banker who we have any of the comments or questions all right I'm going to give you one last word if you'd like so Patty has disorder that's been noticed in complications yes great in that case let's take it to a boat okay would you please call council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro yes councilman Roberts aye council member Sable I vice mayor Shirley um there guys all right so the ordinance passes unanimously equipments 23-02 all right so now we are on to the consent agenda items 11 between 13B for approval of April 3rd 2023 council meeting minutes is the authorized the state manager to executed interlocal agreement between Pinellas County and local governments for the cooperative for pioga Church and dental work today very well for a few months of disaster degree in collection and refutable services and disaster degree monitoring and Management Services within Geographic industry also a proclamation recognizing this week as the 54th annual professional Municipal clerks week and the proclamation recognizing the month of May as Lewis Awareness Month all in favor any opposed all right the consent agenda passage but I'm going to go ahead and uh I'm going to break out this Proclamation concerning the professional Municipal clerks week because I think we and this deserves a red so even though it's already it's already official I'm going to go ahead and read it this is proclamation of the 54th annual professional Municipal clerks week it's April 30th through May the 6th 2023 whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk a time-honored and vital part of local government exists throughout the world and whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk is the oldest among public servants and whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk provides the professional link between citizens of building bodies and agencies of government at other levels and whereas professional Municipal clerks have pledged to be ever mindful of their neutrality and impartiality rendering equal services to all whereas the professional municipal clerk serves as the uniform or I'm sorry it's the information center on the functions of the local government and Community whereas professional Municipal clerks continually strive to improve the administration of the Affairs of the office of the professional municipal clerk through participation in education programs seminars workshops and the annual meetings of their state provincial County and international professional organ whereas is most appropriate that we recognize the accomplishments of the office of the professional municipal clerk now therefore I they've got us mayor of the city of Miller Beach do recognize the week of April 30th through May 6 2023 as professional Municipal clerks week and further extend appreciation to our professional municipal clerk Patricia Gentry and to all professional Municipal Clerks for the bio Services they perform in their exemplary dedication to the communities they represent represent dated this first day of May 2023 thank you now we are all to item number four I'm sorry yes yeah it's okay I like that we've got a just a quick comment on the great job our city manager did and whatever he did in our city and the interlocal agreement with Pinellas County and and the reason for that is how important it is if we were to do that on our own I have seen from a history standpoint that regardless of the agreement you may have with companies out there when it comes time even though you have a signed agreement in place they're going to go typically with the highest paid options available the fact that this is with Pinellas County and Lawrence much larger group in all the cities that have signed it as well less likely to happen so this is a great idea and I think that positions the city very well for being able to have those Services provided if and when Maybe I think Mr Roberts all right we are now on to item 14. this is for authorization to execute and purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated stormwater Master drainage Plan B emails this was replaced on the agenda by city manager reading Mr Freeman thank you mayor so this is for authorization execute purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated this is to complete the design and Engineering Services for stormwater master plan updated in 2016. the remaining bmps which stands for the best management practices for the sure that the training is greater and it would be numbers 6 9 10 11 12 13 and 14.

21st Street 23rd Street 24th Street 25th Street and Morgan Drive the amount of the Posse here is 360 000 and 300 360 374. 1 dollars so a little history and like I said the the master drainage plan was updated in 2016. since then uh prioritize eight of those 15 have been completed the last councilman on April 3rd we proved the note to provide funding to complete the additional 70 Vietnamese um since then I presented the Project's scope to all six engineering firms that we designed agreements with from our RFQ put out a really just the I told them that at the time I would like to hit was to have a complete uh 100 construction plans and technical specifications ready for competitive bidding by August 15th of the six I heard back confirmation before that they could meet that timeline of those four I selected Gemini engineer against Sciences which is actually it came out to be our highest range from the RFQ this project is going to include preparing and or replacing stormwater pipes and Inlet structures it's going to replace all the valid curving and resurfacing of the pavement and on all those streets Independence earlier I also have included the lining of the pipe segments from the closest Inlet to the seawall on 12th Street and 13th Street which was from the last project it was determined they needed to be done future I thought it would get a better cost line you know pricing I guess I should say 30 for doing the lining along this project um I'm sure there's going to be some um it's important to note that Gemini and Engineering scientists I just wanted to reanalyze each BNP and design plans the best address the deficiencies that the city has we want to achieve the highest level of conservation so we want to be put in a massive basically impact I started drafting the work authorization agreement for the strong based on the proposal which I've concluded engineering Sciences appropriate proposal the PMP project maps for the software master plan as well as the Museum of contract for Professional Services that was signed and the uh expires thank you for the description of this uh contract and uh before we go to the council where you can go to the citizens with anyone like you comments uh yes John Hayes at 22nd Street um I'm assuming that silver was lying which would be on the south side of the median recently because that's what they were doing now going back a little bit when they did work back here in Bel Air Island Estates a page from the bridge to Gulf Boulevard both sides of medium and I remember having a conversation with Mr Clint Reeves about the damaged Valley curbing between Bayshore and Gulf but that would be replaced at such time as they got up towards that end of the city I just was glancing through there and I see nothing it indicates there's any consideration for repairing not repairing replacement damaged Valley Curbing and I have a significant amount in front of my property I'm sure there's others between Bayshore and Gulf so my question is West 22nd Street or a minute or is it included and it's big so we're still doing and we're doing the design phase so that it's something that we can look into and if um you know while doing the other curving through the ideal time to to replace what needs to be done there here that the street is already going to resurfaced I will need for that we have Africa I think Mr engine Mr hi I'm Luke Durham again um I really understand the construction or anything with what you're talking about but I heard 12th and 13th Street still needs something done to seal the huh that's my question so towards the end of the project we did inspections on the pipes that were run between the homes and whatever you couldn't access without you know tearing I put it around in that area and discovered that they're not failing but they are deteriorating and it's recommended the engineer that we get those aligned we felt that during this large project that we have coming up that if we included kind of their pricing ideal pricing for them so that's that's between the homeowner's property and the new sewers that we put in so this pipes are from the endless Bay Drive okay the ones that are at the end of 12th at 13th Street respectively and they run from those inlets written down the property ones to the Sea walls so imagine pull up the street again the go through the mammal it's it's exactly what they're going to the actual weight loss sewer system the company's doing right now with those trucks they'll run a chair place piping through the wires is there anything that we as homeowners are supposed to do to prepare for this or will we get a notice of something is it Banner um we get we will send out a notification to our constant content to let you know when they're in the area because typically when we do we do our stormwater projects we do door hangers to notify all the residents in those areas that you know something's about to occur um but I can't say exactly we'll know during the construction phase when they plan on moving over and doing the line of those streets um [Music] the company that didn't work on our street just did a superlative job I mean they did they came back they fixed anything that was wrong and they did it in line with regular time so I hope that was a good obviously surprised to hear if there is still anything left yeah so it'll be it'll be seamless on Tuesday matter days okay um from there everything will be ready thank you very much thank you thank you Miss Durham any other questions or comments around the Google assistance right uh so before we begin debate on this uh we're going to be a motion that's authorization to execute the purchase for the Gemini engineering but someone would like to make a motion some of those motion made by Lloyd Roberts is someone like this second uh Jerry Shirley vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts you have before nightmare I think this is uh it's the appropriate path we're taking which is excellent we're going to have one engineering firm come in and review the vmps that are already in place by a previous engineering firm is that correct in addition to the new areas to be designed so this would be a great opportunity for the city as well as anybody on this Council that wants to be involved to make sure that we that work with the city manager to be comfortable that the direction that the city is going as Kyle mentioned earlier is the most cost effective process that we'll be pursuing so I think it's a great idea I'm very happy this is the direction we're going and I think it's best for the city thank you without answering questions I noticed that Gemini is at Jacksonville do they have local offices yes they're not the same here okay now in other words not for this project but the way our agreement is set about what we can't actually competitively be in Services because it's prohibited as ccma so I noticed this is uh we are including again I mean yeah it'll be the principle I imagine another staff during the uh yeah using them he's got a staff yes so much curricular well they also be making recommendations on a logical order with this project should be rolled out yes there it'll be designed um as best as possible when we lay out the plans I mean it's been on because um let me check into that because I don't know the extent who can tell the construction company should you know how that will affect the pending process so that I'm improving that uh the reason why I ask is okay to attack small problems in front of the big problems in our best standards instead of SMS is just um so the project construction phase is proposed to be 365 days we can try to tighten that up when we actually go up to bid um the intention is to give them time as quickly as possible the exact Order of Canada and it's a job in Indiana but my fear is is we've got these uh the stack of projects and it's approaching and there's someone more I need is area any other questions or comments on this all right so I would like to point out based on what the marriage has said which is very accurate that we're not asking for the design to be completed by August the 15th right so for the engineering firm the uh the timeline is we're expecting to have everything ready to advertise for bid we're looking at five six weeks let me make sure we have uh some bills for that and then um you know tabulations bringing into being for selection I'm hoping construction starts uh late fall but that's my point of bringing that up so by then the storm season theoretically is done right it was just a great time construction standpoint so that when they start the construction hopefully we won't have any hurricanes yet what do you mean we're waiting for whatever last two years we've got two two four students but it can happen yeah okay the residents have spoke they had a perfect timing when they had their shooting stuff I think November 15th and he came before November 15th I think we're going Thursday is the engineering program coming into any of these work sessions that are discussed my intention of having to do at least one presentation okay any other questions or comments Mr Robertson I'm not an insurance expert by any stretch but what's your ears from the engineering firm is there any way we can ask them about areas errors and Omission Insurance can be included on the contract with them that they that they've had that in basically going across so Southern officials in the city I can investigate all the insurance um it's laid out in the actual are a few agreement okay um stupid Mr Morris colleague who I've been working with thank you last call of our questions and comments all right Let's uh let's take this for operation authorization to execute a purchase order but Gemini engineering and Sciences Inc the storm water master of drainage plan a councilman Baker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Doterra yes council member Roberts council member staple hi Smith Shirley hi Mary Davis I am so uh president was briefing over authorized thank you all right we're all doing my favorite item tonight item number 15. [Music] based on annual evaluation criteria uh the device city manager with Mr Reaper mayor so I would compiled all the evaluations that were Philadelphia council members and did a tabulation of how the scoring turned out I think we had one that you know didn't have uh every category but I waited out to make sure that the average the the overall scoring so that um to reflect what this chemistry was inner evaluations so I hope he's sending that to you as easily understood all right before we get to the council let's go to the citizens for comments and I'd like to comment on the computer again back to the council but I'm going to need a motion on this one motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a success all in favor of uh yeah no okay so I'm going to give that one to my change sure all right Mr Speaker what if you read that Proclamation between employee another five percent enough if that's the compose in front of us I think she should get Mr Baker anyone else like the comment yeah all right I uh I agree with Mr bank and I think that it's well deserved and fully Justified um and there are no other other comments from the council I would like to right away and call it okay all right Patty council member Baker yes councilmember 11 stone yes councilmember Notaro yes councilmember Roberts aye councilman stable aye vice mayor Shirley I'm Eric Davis Hi and so it passes unanimously so congratulations Miss Gentry and uh thank you for it on YouTube thanks everyone very much I think we should have cash okay Christmas wish [Music] it was retro I think that's what it is all right we're on to General business item number 16 we haven't changed we will move right along to help the comments since we're doing random words and we're leaving chairs around I've given a computer a rest this month we're coming in from my lab to right and so we'll begin with Lloyd Roberts thank you Mr Marion so I'm so happy that I put those others I I would like to thank our city manager for setting up a meeting with Pinellas County Traffic Transportation Division I think it went very well they came with two staff members from the county along with their traffic consultant that they've worked with before that we have worked with So the plan is now the consultant is going to go back to the drawing board and gather more data since the since those times that they did the study I think it's interesting that the first time they did a study was right around the end through this Cove in time so we all know that the traffic was significant by the time so I think we'll get some very different numbers when they do the study again the County's picking up the tab for that so we don't have any expenditures for that and I think they come back what was the time prospecting I thought they would call us about three to four months of things so at that time we'll have a better idea of what some of the options are regarding what will impact the traffic on Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard as well to with all this it just made it better it's never going to be perfect but I'm confident we can make it better and that's what we take a look at right now so just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on that just a little interesting side note I would have lost a lot of money on this bet we actually had conversations in the meeting about the various crosswalks that we have up here on Causeway Boulevard and Gulf Boulevard I would have bet all the money I'd have and all the money that Dave has that there were two crosswalks on the north and south side of Causeway Boulevard and there's nothing there's just one on the north side so my wife and I were walking the beach the other day and we had to cut off sooner than we normally do because of the higher watermarks so there's not on that side so that's going to factor in I think somewhat tile with regards to what some of our options are to improve the Turning scenarios and the traffic situation there at the intersection of the causeway about the whole line so that's what we're looking forward to thank you thank you commissioner Rose all right let's uh let's move on to Leslie nutera I've already miss material will be standing in for any of the mayor's Council this Friday I'll do to attend I have a prior engagement I'd say it's a charity event if they are they're actually doing a piece on my so I appreciate it and I'm sure everyone will be happy to see all right uh let's move on to council member Livingstone good evening Patty thank you for all that you do this is your week celebrated [Music] we had a wonderful day on Wednesday thanking all of our committee members and it was such a great time so again Patty I know you and Smothers put that together thank you but thank you to two committee members and the community when you volunteer it really makes a big difference truly truly appreciate it thank you Mr Livingstone great paper we try to at our last board session I was directed Atwood contact former customer program about Stephanie roll ie flood mitigation working group so I spoke to him and he didn't really want to step offers you want to come and speak to us at any time identify the city manager you know a few book people had anything [Music] has any impact compassion for uh what team that did to people at building their area like that when they changed October 2021 if you remember a former city manager gave a presentation on FEMA 220 I'm sorry yeah so since the beginning of last year I had residents come up to me and tell me geez my flight Insurance doubled okay I have to drive it and be able to take the words I said in the scotch Rock and he had a hard trust me with the human director I think it was December or November the last experiences they're putting my constituents at the point right now should we get insurance because of other retirees that live in Florida or if you know that's that's the choices that's going to happen on top of that our state legislation had emergency session last year regarding citizens win and Bill 2A actually now says your win policy must be your flood policy so whatever your flood policy says your win policy has to meet they also said anything any structures valued over seven hundred thousand dollars to replace they're not going to cover it you have to go to the private marketing company so it's just a total mess so I was able to get a three-way conversation from DC and Senator Scott's office here last Wednesday we went over all this and then I got another address Friday morning about a resident saying hey my flight insurance I can't afford it I almost double so I got into it I went into Assurance was one of the other writers for the nfit and I said I cannot find the discounts that were supposed to get because if you look at 2.0 just the first paid until 2.0 will tell you your elevation which is located most of this will have elevation certificates making them you should get it'll tell you your highest level in your lowest money and I think it was section Co say discounts so I said it's given a 15 discount and the house is four feet above it Shiva so she says I think the 15 discounts because you're sitting complied with all the different regulations in 2021 which I said I think we spent over a million dollars to comply with that that's going to get us a 15 discount she says well let me look at it she couldn't find an explanation so then when she started saying about the discounts of you know why isn't there one foot you should get 10 percent of the two foot you should get 20 percent and so I said why isn't that discounts about it on that so she says it ain't the math formula is this he says no that doesn't make sense so then she gave me a 400 page manual that FEMA came out okay I'm explaining the discounts so she then told me to contact me which I did they told me to go to the National flood [Music] Insurance Agency 80 or toll-free number located in the Philippines this is like this is a joke but it's costing us a fortune so after 20 minutes and I'm not trying to be disrespectful right hey explaining what I wanted from this person in the Philippines I mean it was big um I asked to speak to the manager on hold for 50 minutes about this one so I contacted the senator again this morning but this is this is a problem a lot of people especially senior citizens with fixed incomes are saying I can't afford to show up my house in and and plus I'm not going to get into that communication I appreciate I'm just trying to paraphrase all this I'm I'm looking at it I'm working on it I'm trying to come up with an answer it's uh I completely understandable uh your frustration I said in a several meetings where they were trying to give us some sort of a formula and no one actually knows how what I can tell basically what I'm saying is that this is a another unseen wealth tax really can't tell you where the extra money is going to or what it's for I think the goal is is to cover people and put them out of business so so those are foreclosed on or sold knocked down and then built up for something else so one of my main the main concern should be everybody is insurance premiums go to and I'm talking 10 15 25 000 for a typical home seven hundred thousand dollars you're not going to find people able to purchase a home and the values you just wanted to do and that's with citizens that's not even going to have IP and most of these private flood markets now when they open so it's a mess and there is a clean formula in 2.0 but nobody wants to apply all right yeah to see or hear anything I can actually explain it probably [Music] but I appreciate all your research I'm trying but I'm trying all right let's go to my exam yes thank you to councilman Baker for training down the bottom of that I really appreciate that but uh other than that I have no comments thank you very much Mr Taylor all right let's go to vice mayor Shirley nothing further for me okay I don't know I guess it's uh left to me uh first off uh I'd like to think um those who came out and had coffee been married nice meeting with you and uh and having some interesting conversations and I'd also like to command the Miller Beach Community Foundation for their marketing along with all who have volunteered to contribute or contributed to their efforts I'd also like to thank all those who currently serve on the committee or board in Bel Air Beach it's always safe to just sit at home and complain on social media but it gets very little done instead each of you have done something much braver forever if you donate your time money and pallets for the City Utah on behalf of this Council of the Kansas City staff I'd like to thank you Mom do I have a motion to return push inter motion made by Frank Baker who I have a second second vice mayor Shirley all in favor aye opposed all right good night everyone no no"
