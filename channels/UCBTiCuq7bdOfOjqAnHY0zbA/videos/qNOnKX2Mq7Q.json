    "transcript": "it's now 6 pm on april 11 2022 city council work session will now come to order please join me and rise for the pledge of allegiance patty will you please call the ball councilmember frank banker your council member leslie otero council member lloyd roberts council member joey shirley here council member mike zabel here vice mayor glenn gunn mayor dave gattis city manager lynn reeves and city attorney andrew salzman thank you before we get started this is a pretty aggressive agenda we have a lot of items to cover but i also know that after so long we tend to brush things get ill don't work any longer i'm going to ask if this council will agree that we end this meeting at 9 00 pm and there's a good possibility we may get through this but if we don't then we schedule a second meeting later in the month everybody okay with that good absolutely great great all right um one other thing i noticed that i added an item number nine on the agenda and it's so very close to item two i would like to just remove item nine or roll it into item two but that's okay want to go with that okay let's get started review city code section 94. this is item one reviewed city code section 94 zoning and ordinance 2201 at this time to the agenda would you like to go ahead and explain it yes this is the last of the sections that the clang review they went through the code it's got a couple other items in there that have been brought up in constant meeting and the citizen advisory board there's a section in there and i'll i'll just kind of go through the highlight uh all the work items in bread fred did this for us before he finished at the end of february and i had andy look at it also and so we're pretty comfortable with what's in there some of the highlights the [Music] there's red there's a definition of a manufactured building the plant review plant board recommended that be added to this so that's in there if you go to page eight the planning board talked about artificial turf and synthetic grass we came up with the definition of that it allows up to 50 of the front yard to be an artificial turf currently you can do that in your backyard but not your furniture ask the furnace was i just curious was any of this information like what you've done somewhere else that we just incorporated fred and i went through this and we found a couple other cities that had it and the stipulations that were in it basically for the artificial perhaps was that need to be at least one and a half inches tall artificial turf did and should have a minimum of six ounces a and permeability of the 30 inches so all this stuff was was added to the ordinance to make it reasonable an introduction on your part and and what it was about we've got a few yards that have put artificial turf and realized that there's an audience not in the whole front yard patches like there's one uh across the street from where joey lives uh there's one on donato kind of caddy corner where glenn lives and another man came in and he was gonna put his whole front yard in it we have to tell so he him around the city saying well that's got a piece in the piece come out that's got a piece so uh the planning board looked at it and said well maybe we ought to create a definition and create an opportunity for people to put it in if they want to and in most research that we did only they were only allowed 50 of the front yards so everything else had to be regular landscape so that's uh are we going to go over this like what you said in detail because it was introduced by city manager and uh yeah we'll just go over the highlights and then we can take it and then there was a couple comments about making sure the strategic plan is annotated in this section of the code and the freeboard requirement that was added into the section of the code about building specifications on page 14. second on page 16 the parking of the boat for 24 hours just notifying the city previously we and it's still there we do have with the permit it can exceed 24 hours to 72 hours and you get a permit to leave the voters in your driveway but my resident brought this up and council member frankfurt uh brought this forward and so we just added that in here [Music] and then really the last thing of any major importance was the issue with backyards of water properties on page 17. the citizens advisory board looked at this and kind of came up with the trade-off that said currently you can go to five foot up to five foot the seat ball you can be six foot in height or eight foot for edge uh they looked at moving them back to 12 feet from the seawall of individuals actually they came to the council meeting just uh on page 20 there's a we added including moving bands and moving trailers there's a total definition that said pods clarify that so if somebody is moving they'd be able to get a permit for the city to do something and i put behind that uh the minutes from the citizens advisory board of january 20th and the site before were they recommended moving moving back to 5p except on the property by the city as an example next to a park something 46-foot so we can start with so what's the status of this now we have our next board meeting will it be what happens if everything's good with this tonight then we will convert it into appointments and it will be on the next meeting also we have jody shirley was actually on the citizen advisory committee while they were discussing this and also ron sagan here tonight so if anyone has any questions concerning these items that are listed here they are with that being said should we just start at the top yes all right so we are at item c on page two actively strive to achieve and adhere to the city of baylor beach strategic plans and guiding documents for nation vision poor values and goals i see no problem with that i'm wondering where that came from yeah i like it anyone have a differing opinion all right so now we're on page four and this is definition of manufactured building modular building or factory-built building it's pretty straightforward it's just a definition assuming this was put in there in the event that we do have a problem with prefab anything i have a question [Music] in our condo several people along the side of the building have you know those i said rubber whatever you want to call them sheds that they keep their they're not their surfboard but they're they're guarding stuff in their stuff i mean would those those count as a manufacture building or are those an accessory structure yeah i don't think that that actually falls under this uh this heading just because of its ability to have an internal structure heating ventilating plumbing et cetera i think it's just prevent a crane from coming in and dropping a new home in place and dusting their hands off about page four and five now we are up to i guess we need to start on page seven to understand what it is we're looking at landscaping requirements and then we'll move over to page eight and there's an addition to the line chief park and i think that this is just following florida code is that correct i actually took time to read it today any objections everybody good with that right traffic hazards it's uh it kind of falls under the same it's self-explanatory we're just following state all right now we're down at the bottom of the page artificial turf synthetic grass this is a long one we've already had a brief description about it after reading this i thought that it was reasonable i thought that it was a reasonable solution and it sounds like it's you're not putting a quarter inch high pile out there you're actually putting something that looks like grass in place was that the intention yes it was tough so we wouldn't uh have someone go to home depot and buy nora carter i mean i'm going to remember obviously uh beginning with precaution for installation um yeah it's not transferring okay thank you okay no i think we're in this microphone um with vii i just had a basic question about that one about normally they don't start pounding into tree roots i don't know if that was really a problem you see it can be you know i think just like when you do construction around the trees you have to put a tree barricade up it's going to be i would say we probably have the same sort of procedure so you need to stay off of you know stay a distance from the tree whatever type of tree might be different i think based on the type of truth yep and then the next one's fine um i agree with x obviously where i do come into a problem with this is the locations allowed i was kind of confused reading it here in your description that you can install in the back it's the front that you you're coming under the limitations okay that's why the section in there about paper blocks the biggest problem i do have is number four the existing artificial turf that tells you if you've got it installed right now ten years it's gone your investment fifteen twenty thousand dollars gone to replace by side i mean possibly you're not able to find your complaints you know yeah what that paragraph lacks those it doesn't tell you what must be met now i mean it's just magic wand whatever you got in here it's a criteria but it doesn't say hey you know you still have to be the fade stuff or whatever right i mean that's what's kind of lacking that paragraph i i agree with that hey you know your grandfather didn't but there is a minimum minimum standard like hey if it's fading down it doesn't mean you don't have to replace it so [Music] i also uh i had a question if you go back to the uh the top i'm looking on page nine at the very top there you use the term building official but i don't see it in the definitions so i don't know if it's colored someplace else but maybe i missed it but i i looked back for a building official i didn't see a definition of lucid building official i've never seen a one and a half inch pile on him so i guess i'm permeability and stuff all makes sense to me with things talk about my house i'll show you guys one i had a funny move relatively low while you're on that section they're going to do a densification test since this has a permit i mean what's the one off let's see absorb [Music] well that's a good point yeah so i i i put you know in the purpose for anymore but it's yeah what i'm saying yeah yeah but that's what i'm saying identification test or something like that so what happens with you my backyard floats and sort of getting played install pumps but it's also the purpose of the other three buildings around higher than the branch on the property yeah about your neighbors does it run off into your neighbor it runs off of the knee unfortunately yeah and then i it's that i can put drainage systems in so it runs off the turf into the branch through the tiers so whatever you're putting this stuff over uh you're kind of stuck with the ground's ability to absorb the water that's right that's what i'm getting because they put it on blacktop or asphalt yeah it's just it's just going to puddle and most of our areas are shallow well my question is is what's the difference how much you absorb didn't put this left he didn't put any artificial grass on top of it it's still the same thing you still have the same condition that's that's why i'm asking the question is are you changing the dynamic of the uh the property's ability to absorb water or are you just now you have wet grass you know i don't know i'm trying to yeah everything we did we see investigations looked into it is the grass itself because what you're using doesn't seal it because you don't want water holding up on that because the layers you're actually putting sand into the rug and they forgot to get part of the day they look sand into so going back to what mr brent bank of brought up do we force people to change what they already have i mean beyond ensuring that this stuff is permeable is there anything else we should we should make the homeowner do well um we said the previous owner put it down what what was the black top leg was called crack then paved driveway et cetera but on the gravel section scrape away the gravel to a depth of about three inches i put more gravel on top and you'll see a layer of asphalt that's been placed to dig i have to dig through and crack it with a pickaxe to get down beneath that so any water that does come in it's really not absorbed in the ground it's sent via the level to the front or it pulls in the back of the yard he did that for basically weeks but wasn't that the way they installed all those gravel yards back in the 70s so i think that was just i was just a few few yards in the city would gravel over the top of them or it's asphalted that's how they installed them back then that was yeah i mean they're very older yards they they asphalted and then they put pea ground yeah and you say when they asked for it was that like a one-inch quick layer of asphalt which was a little of course you know what i'm saying there's no rebar i mean yeah but i'm just saying sometimes when you only put the one inch down it's very forced it will it will actually suck up whatever it is it's been grandfathered then we can't change it i mean and that that's typical throughout pascal pinellas counties yard after yard has that material in it and it's just northerners buying these a second homes did not want maintenance did not put grass in their yard that's just the way it was and we can't change that so this isn't going to affect that i mean this is this we do have a provision in here um item b it says proper drainage shall be provided for our all artificial turf installation and they got to get a permit so i think it's going to be on a case-by-case and it's going to be up to kyle who's going to review those permits as they're submitted to make sure that they're providing the proper drainage proper grains massage as well yeah you're not supposed to dump green child yeah my swimming pool all right okay i understand that in the section any other questions about this particular section everybody okay back to glenn's original question oh yes are we allowing a grandfather clause for those that have it because maybe they're not exactly any specifications at this point they must have something like that too i'd agree with the grandfather well i agree with the grant i've got no problem but it doesn't state needing a certain minimum down i mean if you were to drive by it has been there for five years i've got no problem but if it's faded or catchy or whatever what's the what's the legal answer you do have i mean in essence or is your grandfather you're telling them they have 10 years from the date that you enacted or like anything else if they're doing more than 50 then they have to come in compliance with the ordinance as if you know if anything grandfathered in the home so you do have that provision in them so they have to meet the requirements too within if if they're currently if they're not in compliance they have basically if it's fading they have 10 years unless they're root unless they replace it within 50 percent then they have to do it there was one thought when i looked at the 50 it maybe unfairly targets ranch homes by multi-story houses because you're subtracting square round footage of the home for example two houses on my property and i got half acre if i have a double story my footprint is less that allows me to put more turf if i got the rancho which i do which takes up too much almost twice the area i missed sable is your microphone no thank you no thank you i appreciate that thank you um but double the area now they've got a ranch home my ability to put soda is much less well remember the the reason you're you're if you pass this ordinance the idea is for everybody to come in compliance with this new standard that you have and the fact of the matter is is that a lot of those properties you're talking about may have not probably didn't do it properly to begin with so you're giving them a 10-year break to come into compliance after they've done something either without a permit or improperly so they from a legal standpoint i think you're you're okay with enacting something like this in fact you're you're being more than fair and giving people 10 years from that time period now the only people that you really have to worry about are those people that sell their property in nine and a half years and then people that don't know when they buy it that they have become compliance but other than that now i agree with that because especially in the last 10 years the technology has come from walmart grass carpet to almost every nfl stadium that's running what they call field turf and that's expensive stuff and it's amazing so i agree thank you question on page nine the proper grade shall be provided for all artificial turf installations to prevent excess rounds of water they're confident they're remaining the discussion we just had previously so in other words a guy has an old grandfather gravel on top of an asphalt and he wants to now scrape off the gravel display of artificial turf over here he hasn't i think he's good because i don't think the turf grass impacted anything it was already bad it was already imperfect he or she didn't do anything to make it worse yeah that's that's reminder my situation the only reason it didn't get worse is at the same time we put up the drainage system right would you make it better if anything it caused us to improve the property but it was it was bad to begin with but when i think that getting a permit is gonna require to dig up that asphalt and install it properly i usually install properly over what's there because they will put the ground they put the underlayment the gravel then the topsoil and that's compacted and then the turf and the sand and brush down and the artificial turf will meet the permeability restrictions that were identified in this already so when you buy it they're going to say that this is our comfortability again you're saying it's not the artificial turf that's called right it's your property yeah it's already a problem to begin with and then it goes back to old code and specifications that it never passed today's standard but just because they're wanting to change the color of their lawn or or get away from watering and things like that i don't think it's for some people who are allergic to grass right we shouldn't smack people for trying to improve their homes well you just brought up an issue of color smurf turf well what if somebody wants to play parkour yeah i don't have an answer on that one green light black individual glazed brush top top of page nine and bottom of page nine all artificial church shall be maintained in a greedy faithless condition thank you what did you mean you could get shot some people [Music] i do know a lady that lives in bel air beach that absolutely would have purple grass if she could i'm not saying that that should ever pass but that's what i'm concerned about we've seen multiple colored grapples out there i've seen purple gravel but i do have a question about the 50 in the front so i read that you know it's 100 on both sides and 100 percent in the back why did it ever get started that this somebody would say only 50 percent well in most areas that we did research on they wanted to limit it to make them not just make it in the front yard a you see it in the front and then behind it closer to the house you'll see shrubs or trees or bushes or landscaping so it's fifty percent of the overall square footage of the lagrange unit right and what would be defined as the front yard that's open right away only in your property line okay so like you just mentioned so any shrubs or palm trees or anything that's subtracting from that overall square footage that's 50 you're good to go on your driveway okay good any other questions about this section before we move on generally sure it's great seeing the height you know the changes in the red identifiable i mean that has to be a standard practice because i mean there's other documents in here which you use all before i'm going to sit there immediately the whole entire document and try to figure out what's changing that's a great standard practice absolutely yeah we had you know with the standard uh we'll make much easier to read okay uh page 11 let's see 2-262 reference how did that come about was it incorrect before or did it change no it was just updating something that was not moving further down page 11 number seven central variance is not in conflict with the city of miller b strategic plan like it already yes we are on page 13 implementation purpose of determining plant species to remove refer to the most current edition of the department of agriculture and consumer services not nauseous weeds rule chapter 5b 57 fac this gives us a guide i like it we didn't want to listen to 500 plans i'm curious how many um how many varieties are on the list today today i couldn't tell you but it's over i remember right so let's get rid of our pepper plants peppers were already in there because it's considered grass and our code says our grass can only be seven inches tall so remember so that's why we went around to a lot of these lots and you've seen over the last couple years we've told them they got to remove them or it's just perfect it's always nice to have an outdoor reference that like okay this is our list and we don't maintain it but we abide by it now we are on page 14 and that's just to make it consistent with the building code which that means that if your bfe is eight and you're building a new home structure it has to be questions about that is it 12 inches or 80 the one for 18 inches one foot do you have any concerns all right now we are on page 16. and this is dealing with the parking boats our current code only allows for 72 hours okay and what was brought up and council member frankfurt brought this up i wanted to change the code to allow a boat to be brought in as long as they notified the city they could leave it overnight to get it ready for the next day the previous and we still left the 24 to 72 hours okay i have a little bit of a problem with this and not necessarily the time but maybe um i'm just not sure if this is going to encourage people with large boats pulled behind large trucks going to their circular driveways and they can't fit i just want to make sure that if we do this i mean it's really not a big deal we need to actively monitor boats sticking out of the street while they're home for the night just to make sure that we don't have a problem and i only bring this up because there was one on bay shore that was parked out there for it was only one night but no lights there weren't really many reflectors and a corner of it was sticking right out and i thought some kid comes through here going too fast he might flip with him isn't that covered you're not you can't be out the street at all can't exceed your driveway limits yeah i saw that earlier i'm sure it is three i guess the point i'm making is whenever they call in or they receive a permit maybe we give them something that says here's the rules signed here to make sure that the when you brought that up currently the guys just have to call right now to get the perfect they can be no no no well yeah they they can we can email the permit to them but that's for 72 hours that's permanent is good that's something that was his favorite environment what this was an individual came to a constant meeting i think he talked to frank he brought up that i want to take my boat out tomorrow morning and i bring it home to charge the battery and it's late at night it's late at night keeps it on high and dry so it makes sense and we do get calls from and the problem is not to interrupt you but the city closes at 4 30 he gets off of work at five o'clock so he wanted the courtesy just not him he has other neighbors too say hey can i email the city can i call a city leave a voice message and receive email you know what i'm saying next okay you don't give the people this parking yeah uh no i believe they just get notified all they do is have to notify in the first 24 hours but then if it's 72 hours they're required perhaps what's that my my wrong for the word target for the 24 hours just he wanted just to notify the city yes okay you don't understand i appreciate it i do have kind of an issue how do you monitor it i mean what is the deal with what [Music] that the city can monitor how do you monitor the situation that's where boats all settle start sitting out in the driveways for weeks or whatever well i will tell you there there's an individual at the 22nd and tonight whatever you're talking about and i personally have been to his house several times because it's you know it's off hours of enforcement somebody calls and says hey and he's notorious for not getting anything and then when you go talk to him i know i know and then he says well there's a boat down the street there and so it's kind i understand that the coach says 72 hours currently but how do we that's that's what we've hung our hat on and you can only get three times a caliber here but the 24-hour thing is for someone just to bring it home get it ready to go out go fishing or something and take it the next day so at least if they call in code enforcement would be old or definitely know that there's a boat that's in a house for 24 hours if they're sticking out i mean they should we should have code enforcement out there the police telling them they can't do that because they're obstructing roadway right and and somebody needs to i mean that like you said that could be a problem or you could give this particular parking uh rules when they get their phone so that they know exactly what they want but in the 24 hour the problem with the 24 hours is we don't have 24 hour code invoices and that's where you run into the problems during the weekend it's the prime time for abusing the privilege so two nights nobody's gonna tell but uh well no they do tell well i'm sure you're right they used to test they're telling the awards because their name goes on that's what we're throwing around that's that's called people still do tell but a lot of times now and just vice versa they have to put their name on it which now is the law we have for us to technically investigate a complaint they have to put their hand on it here's the thing we have provision already that they can do this for you know they can get a permit i don't know why we need to change it we already are accommodating people that need to bring their bono um i don't and if you just bring it home to detail it you don't do that every weekend you know i don't know why we need to change them they're doing it because their batteries run down and they need to charge them up and they don't have a charging station or an ac outlet where they're apart that's that's the main issue but if you don't use your boat for a week or two and you have a draw when there's batteries [Music] i don't know i think i think we've got a good code for that and i think people should get permits i don't i don't like this haphazardly parking your vehicle and the driveway i can tell you on my street we've got a lot of boat owners and it would be an issue and when they're parking a boat in their driveway there's not enough room for all their kids to park their cars and then that's going to spill cars out of the road and it's just it's i don't think it's a good plan the car should be out on the road anyway well but if you have nowhere to park your car because you're at the boat the driveway they're going to be in they're going to be in the road is it possible to get a permit by email yeah that's most of the time will be the way you do it so so all it takes is planning that's it if you plan ahead even though it's one day that you need that boat you're going to get three days is that right most these people mr mayor won one 24 hours praying at five o'clock happy for six in the morning yeah and and uh i think the point is vice mayor gunn and council member shirley are making is that we're allowing what we're losing control if we just require a phone call because who's to say that they called it all and how would you know that we have voice we have voicemail right right but they would leave a message on the phone system i think the bigger issue is our permit may only be issued no more than three times a year that would be the bigger if you wanted issue increase that so all right i'm just throwing some hypotheticals out there um every hind i've used two hydras actually three i've used three of them and every one of them had lift service and they and there was a place to clean up and a place to flush your engine the only time it's not convenient is if you show up at the end of the evening after they're closed if leave your boat in the water and um and and then it's sitting in the water and then you have to deal with it the next day or they'll put it up dirty or you pay to have it flushed in the case of a trailer where are they keeping it now all this storage you've had the causeway here which used to have the flushing areas okay and the sheriff's had flushing areas catapulted his a couple fistfights because guys were taking too long to watch the boats so i don't know where these guys are they may have charging for importance flushing areas and everything we get i don't know this is just for the typical guy who wants to get the boat some of these guys say they have their boats 5-10 miles away so rather than getting out of the house going to get with their coat opening it up it's just this is a voting community i mean right i'm sympathetic to what they're wanting to do i just uh am not saying you're a voter you know better than i i mean i know what a pain in the body could be but and a lot of these guys everyone will tell you he gave me a slip but there's only so many slips available here they would get a slip okay i've got no problem if you can monitor this thing and control it the issue is i think you're going to lose that by just giving a blanket approval to anybody who wants to pull his boat into his driveway for 24 hours so we've got one person who's saying it's an inconvenience or whatever when we look at the stats for code enforcement complaints the number three issue was parking of that of those complaints for parking over 30 percent of them was about boats and rvs being parked in people's driveways so that's a hard and fast statistics as opposed to one person saying i'm the inconvenience let's change all the codes so that i can bring my trailer home for one day well i got no problem with that why don't we if it's that big of an issue why don't we do the same thing we're doing with uh traffic call if there's an issue go out and get us 10 signatures or something but it's a problem in the city bring it to the city council but we've got to get off this one person call up and paul said we've got a change in the work well i disagree with the one person he came to the lead but i think he speaks for a lot of voters that don't have i've heard it and uh [Music] what did it say previously because the 24 is in red was there a different number there well no it was 72 hours and 3 is what changed it was modified so that's why you put it all in [Music] so i know it's an inconvenience and i've had to do it myself before i had my boatline installed i was going and getting my boat playing all day grabbing it at the boat ramp rather than taking it all the way across town i pull in the driveway do a quick engine flush out to get the saw out of the engine okay and rinse the thing off and then take it out before dark that's that's what i did i don't recall having the boat in my yard all night long and i also remembered about the neighbors complaining about another neighbor whose boat as you referred to as uh is out there all the time i don't have a problem with someone keeping their boat in their driveway for one night or a couple of nights provided that there's some control and i think that really we'd be better off using the same system that we're currently using if that's if we're able to obtain a permit through the email we make it is it it just requires a little bit of planning on friday you should be able to is it a manual process i'm assuming it is you request by email and then you get something back yeah what the previous code said the temporary parking would vote in a residence attention driveway uh shall be permitted for a period not to exceed 48 hours well when it was 24 we increased it to 72 or that's what was submitted here to the attorney for the purpose of washing cleaning and detailing the vessel provided that the owner first obtained a permit and it's displayed on the boat the permit currently the code says and it still says that only the issue three times a year that's what it says making repairs it's prohibited everything else is the same okay so you know if you want to leave it the way it is and you're concerned that somebody can't bring it over three times a year maybe the solution is extended over time increase the number of times maybe make it six times because i live on my boat in the summer in the winter i don't touch it so they're all valid points i i don't i'm i'm open to it obviously it's 48-72 i don't think i don't i don't really want you to instructions or rules right what's a reasonable number of times they need a placard that they stick on the boat so when officer goes by our code enforcement sees it then or if we get a phone call and somebody says well they got a boat their driveways were there for overnight and i will tell you the one i spoke about you know we've had to go visit well his isn't even in his driveway most of the time yeah but that's probably but we do get a lot of calls just last week we had or well what's reasonable three times is not enough how many times would you as a voter typically want to leave your vote if you didn't have your legs well what i was doing was i it was a different situation but i'm assuming that everyone was kind of in that situation where they have a place that they're storing their mood it's not at their house and it's obviously not somewhere convenient if they're bringing it in and trying to do all this stuff in their house whenever i was keeping mine in a high and dry they just put it on the rack and even after they closed up i'd stay there working on it cleaning and polishing whatever and uh and getting it ready to put away and then i'd snap the cover on and i'd leave it there the next morning they would just put it away for me so unless they're just leaving it in a parking lot which that's what if i didn't have the boatload that's what i'd be doing right now i'd be leaving my boat in a parking lot and trailering it back and forth because i just refused to use a hydraulic but i would use the thing i would use it all the time i put 200 hours on my boat the first year i had the one that i currently have but every time you put it in the water you don't need to leave it overnight in your driveway so eight times a year i mean that sounds like a lot to me but i think about the summer months if it's every other yeah maybe you're thinking too big a year maybe it's like two nine consecutive times in a week i mean during the summer once just like you say you're going to be living on your goals right i'm just saying we're going to increase it to that and you're going to have boats all up and down the street all the time which i think that's what we're trying to prepare twice a month too much i think twice a month would be you know two nights in any calendar month which might be fair it gives people maybe we say just for votes we go back to your permits for 24 hours you can do it twice a month i would not say i would not give them a specific number but then just to say well i have 12 times i'm leaving it here for two weeks that's where we run into problems two times a month two days you know i think that's why 48 hours there it's just you're leaving it overnight oh so you don't get two nights out of it right so 248's in a 30-day period not to be communal if i mean you can bank all these numbers yeah save them up i'm gonna put it there for a month we'll attain it done okay it's like it's not like the uh club where you have a minimum folks i'm happy with the way it's written right now the phone call okay mr roberts yeah but you just you guys just agreed to the last time make sense twice twice a month twice a month now consecutively and maybe think about putting a flushing station down by the marina parking lot that works and if it doesn't you can address it again right and then still have to get it and what that does is that tells the neighbors that he actually took the steps to make it legal and he's not just like some other meetings yeah one of the questions that i have is i mean is it i haven't seen the permit is it it's just something easily readable it's i still like the ability to email for the permit i understand you have to pick it up but in the issue of that flushing station take a look at the cost for us to install one for the residents only where would you put that at i i really don't know i mean what i did in the navy was different from you guys i was talking to marina yeah i like that idea in fact you'd probably use it right we're going to have i don't know i mean i'm what i did navy was totally different i'm just throwing that up there something similar certain days that particularly was pretty full well i mean on the weekends we thought about earlier now i still think we need to have a maximum number of days in the year because you might get the guy who just brings his vote on to his neighbor or whatever you know well if you say two times yeah that's a lot of days so you're saying it should be less than 24. yeah two times a month yeah because we're talking about the summer months and then all of a sudden now you've got 24 days instead of you know it's not really 24 days because he's not going to use that boat at certain times of the year it's nasty it's windy it's cold it rains also a good time to prepare for summer months to next to your bedroom window consequences all right we're going to have to we're going to have to reach your consensus on this somehow yeah because you can't make repairs or things like that no but if you're flushing your engine i mean i don't want to hear that every every other weekend for 12 months how long does it take to question me 10 minutes questions flushing it and uh and also what i love that's another problem is you're flushing your boat in there you know you know the runoff from an engine flush is nothing considered to an afternoon thunderstorm dropping three inches of rain [Music] but it would i think the idea of the flushing station i could see that in the middle of that parking lot where you could have a couple of boats one on each side and you have a couple of uh nozzles and and i think it would be a great courtesy under the table [Music] if we're able to pull that off i would like to to seriously consider a decal for boats in our community that way if the police show up and they see somebody flushing his boat and he doesn't have a doesn't have a sticker nope you're out of here i thought we were going the last council you know actually came up with some kind of an idea on that for like the dock inspections and everything like that that we were going to do the boat decal i know we discussed it i i don't i don't know how you do it no well i thought there was something that written were wrong that we were going to put a decal on about our features no it was actually we were talking about putting an inspection detail on the dock not the boat would it be too far a stretch to assume that the vehicle towing the boat is gonna have a miller beach sticker on it okay so you feel like 12 uh 12 months or 24 say six i like what lynn just said it's uh up to two months maximum 12 per year and 72 or 48 or 24 hours for each of those events it's one night right 48 hours no two times per month a maximum of 12 am each of those events is 24 hours yes it's i would say overnight that's where right because you don't want to mix it like you don't want to say i brought it in at 11 o'clock one night and i don't have a problem with someone bringing their boat in in their own driveway for an hour during the day doing something to it fixing a wiring problem and it's out of there i don't have a problem with that well i think the issue is if you want to keep it overnight overnight that's the only thing we're going to do and check the flushing station again yeah all right are we in agreement now how you feel okay so that's 12 times maximum two times 12 times maximum per year two times per month is that right over uh each incident is one night overnight all right yeah station really glad we're not discussing this it'll be a regular meeting that's why i wanted this this makes it simpler because then we're bringing it to you you've already discussed it okay preparing for sailing that was part of it and now we are on to fences walls and hedges and that's on page 17 and i actually appreciate whoever was responsible for moving the setback for the fence back to 12 feet because many people were complaining about not being able to see on the seawall the only only thing that's really added is that section of mountain park if you're adjacent to a park or a public land fence okay question when we talk about within 12 feet of the sea wall with the retired property bounded in the bowl or in part by any body of water what if you're on the gold is the only gulf without a sea wall so well i mean you're counting that as i guess you're kind of okay i think somewhere i thought i've read that the body of water was miller beach water well it's called any body of water because it's separately addressed the impostor so what happens to people that have those hedges above that height to walk it back it happened well i guess we have to do it with unfortunately that's the way a lot of our city code works it relies on complaints to be enforced because we don't want anyone just jumping in our backyard and doing random inspections are these pages or trees i think we've had this conversation there's several patches several of these conversations are things that are closely planted together trees don't you treat me and i'm okay yeah okay that's all i can do because the hedge is considered more like effects well yes it's like a fence fences walls and hedges not trees it doesn't say so when i have a hedge that's under six feet inside probably okay shall not exceed a height of eight feet in the required side setback area so you couldn't have a hedge seven and a half feet away from your neighbor's wall higher than eight feet is that right i read that correctly yeah where's that from the water right i mean oh it's 12 foot 12 foot back it has to be 12 foot from the seawall it is four foot okay from that point on if it's a hedge it could be eight foot if it's a fence four feet so the way i'm reading this if you want to have a 35 foot hedge as long as it's 12 feet away from the sea wall and in my case seven and a half feet from my neighbor's property what's that the hedge if i want to have this gigantic more than eight feet as long as it's between the boundaries of the setbacks i can have whatever i want pretty much all right does anyone have any questions about section 94-251 are you okay with that okay thank you so much for making this a great bond it's it's helping speed this right on so we're on page 20 now yeah and all these changes were for is to clarify a moving man or a moving trailer because in our code all we previously talked about was portable storage units i got one question on my property so i have a travel trailer that i use but it's behind the six foot you know fence it's not considered a movie trailer it's a travel trailer right it has to be you can have a trailer [Music] inches over the top of my fence ain't just turning the other just trying to figure out what the the intent of this was it's really primarily moving in movie trailers pods things that are incidental to a move at the time right exactly and they they get a permit there's a fee and you only get one for every 90 days and it's good for seven days and i i suspect that someone showed up with a moving van and was parking it in their driveway no what happened was someone had a moving man they put it in the driveway to move and somebody questioned because the code only said bonds didn't say portable storage units okay the wage out at number three including moving mans moving trailers on any streets so somebody's moving out what happens well no they can't put we just added moving bands movies trailers they can't leave them parked overnight in the street that's really what that's for so they're using it for if i got home construction i'm bringing it in it's going to be up the street while the moving goods into the light is ongoing and then as soon as it's done you got to pull that trailer out go to storage whatever but it's no longer on the streets right and you still cover the piles right yeah we've we've even had a couple of people for the longer streets it's on the street under that section that's what we're talking about yeah so on any street or public right away you cannot do that no matter what all right so a movie man comes in to move me out they need to be in your driver what if it's a tractor trailer like most of these are that's that's my question he's not there he's there for could be there for an hour to be there for eight hours depending on how big a house is he's not leaving it there long term like this that doesn't we'll have to look at that probably no different than a contractor that's working on my notes oh yeah you're one guys yes bringing it out of these travelers they're all they're on the street all the time right where you get a shipment of furniture so if you're moving in and you have moved your entire house in one of these transfer tractor trailers is it reasonable to expect them to get everything out and off the street before nightfall they're normally [Music] [Music] i actually had this experience in boston with my daughter and there was a time limit to be on the street trying to remember what the time it wasn't a lot of time it's like four hours i think we had to get everything out but i think you want to leave at the same time those are also smaller downsides than a full ranch house here right here we're talking about temporary structures is the netting of this section why are we even talking about vans and trucks but we'd have to change the title [Music] what we're trying to do is just add something because we've got complaints about you know like a u-haul trailer well it's not a pot well it's sort of the same purpose it's a pot on wheels right well this joey said every week on the street someone's getting washed and delivered dryer would it furniture or whatever appliances dressers building materials we put a roof on it and another guy across the street from us the semi was with that so we're basically going to take out the including moving vans and moving trails right we'll take this around put it in a different yeah are we in a hurry to get this done this uh these changes no we just went on i'm asking because looks like we pretty much knocked us out and i guess as long as we get a sneak preview after the edits are made we can give our own feedback and add it to the agenda well then remember mayor death two readings so you're gonna have the first reading and then we can make whatever additional changes council wants before the second period so we need to prepare to make additional changes also i would like to thank the citizen advisory committee for your hard work and uh making this easy on us and also you city manager lynn reeves that was the planning and review board that was the citizenlink advisory committee let's plan the review boards right yeah we had a couple other things several people working with us that's nice okay so let's move on to review city manager selection process flowchart and while we're at it let's uh review the job description for city manager [Music] vice mayor gunn you added this why don't you take it away yeah you should all have a handout here for those people who are familiar with work breakdown this is kind of like a high level one without a lot of detail you had the initial page in there and it's been modified somewhat to add some detail to it at the each level there if you look at the second page the actual flowchart you'll see the check mark if you uh we've already drafted and posted the advertisement for the job there's an arrow there that kind of links it to uh the first column on the left here you need to find the job description we'll get into that in a few minutes because they kind of go hand in hand there because kind of need to ensure that when these people are filling out their applications and they go to the website to check the job description the two are kind of aligned there they're not going to send in an application based on that job posting only for us to change the job description two or three weeks down the line so you've got the the high level blocks there we've got the planning stage column on the left side you've got the advertisement and posting jobs on the uh the application task in the center there and on the right side you've got the actual selection task there in the uh you got kind of like a two-liner thing what the high-level task is and in the lower the last line bottom line towards the right side i've tried to kind of identify who has that responsibility for completing that task some of them if you look at the uh the little block on the left side there we go to find a job description well that's kind of to be determined it's kind of at this level i think that maybe we bounce it off the citizens advisory committee but uh that's one of the things that needs to be done if you look at the next follow-up pages for instance the planning task i've taken the left column there and broken it down to define some of the embedded tasks in there we can sandy check some of these things and at our leisure we can go back and add things perhaps when you get a chance in the next couple days take a look and see if we've missed some things i'm trying to just hit the big things that we want to remember it needs to get done i've uh added deadlines in there for some of these things because i think it's critical that some of these things must have data lines on them to ensure that the dependencies and sequences are right and that certain things are going to get done before we open that first application package before we go to the first decision block for trying to sort through the applications and decide who we're going to do there i don't know how much detail you want to go into this thing or whatever you want just yeah briefly i got uh just one quick thing on your selection task x1 you had initial call of applicants on the detail you had cac and cc on um overall you only had cac okay so which one are we talking about this is uh you look at your overall uh over under selection tests s1 you have cac only if you go into the detail uh in the back you have cat and cc okay so as i started embedding some of these things here yeah i mean i wasn't it's not one for one yeah it's a draft coming up i understand no i like the detail and it gives us good good guidelines [Music] i think the biggest thing that kind of needs to be done at this point is start filling into the blanks and say dig on it when do we want to have some of this stuff done the one that's really critical is determining the criteria you're going to use to decide who's going to make it to the short list because i think we need to get that stuff we need to have that criteria in our back pocket before we open up the first application package because i kind of look at this in terms of how we do contracts and stuff like that we don't want to create an opportunity for somebody is going to get selected and somebody else over here could say wow i'm going to file a lawsuit against you because you kind of change the criteria later into the thing you don't want to open up the application packages and start looking at it and say let's reweight this criteria it concur yeah one look i would recommend you have to go basically like a t-minus situation here your drop dead date is that guy's retirement that'd be the last one your final selection usually has to be at least two weeks prior to that so we have that on stone just back that up and then take every step behind that and back them up further well it's even closer than that because the applications are due may 23rd right so before you open those things and start calling the stack of applications i think you're going to want to have some sort of straw man selection process and criteria in your hand before you start opening those packages and start sorting through them right this guy is in the little bueno pile or this guy is a definite consideration of this guy as a baby you better have an idea what you're going to be considering and what kind of wave it's going to have concur but you really got to start at the end that final date but everything you got to back up from there and that'll tell you what the deadline look we need those guidelines probably in the next two weeks yes election criteria and i think it's incumbent upon the citizen advisory committee to come up with their criteria that the council come up with a criteria and then we kind of blend the two and come up with okay this is this is the final thing we're going to do what kind of salary range are we looking at here i think we we said it's commensurate with experience with credentials i think that's going to be determined when we start getting applications and seeing what the requirements are we don't know well yeah but if i'm applying for the job okay i'm going to want to know what you pay i mean maybe he'll want to reapply well it goes up he you might be careful with that sort of thing because it bit us in the front once before the city manager hiring foster is here so you know we we had some guidelines and we said no if this person's out of range or whatever or you hire somebody and he's just using it as a placeholder while he's still searching somewhere else so i think you just kind of need to maintain an open mind on this and maybe it starts with in the application process what are your considerations for the salary well yeah but anyone interviewing for a job doesn't want to throw out a number because then they're going to say well i underbid myself already overbid myself okay so we should say the salary range is between 100 and 150 000 a year okay depending on qualifications so you don't have a bunch of applicants saying i'm not taking a city manager's job in case 120 a year i want more you know it's pretty typical to have a range a minimum and a maximum yeah you know do we publish that or do we just say send a resume which sound we require i've published that because you want in some cases a self-selection criteria post prior to entering yes that is they self-select look i'm not going to do it or i am and that calls a lot of your work out so the ones that are remaining are the ones that are truly interested and you can spend your time on them constructively but are you willing to stretch that number if you see somebody whose application comes in and say this guy is the best value it's a stretch my stretch is already put into that wording salary measured upon experience that's my stretch and that allows me within budget guidelines to maybe exceed you know that broad broad guideline that we put up there we also have a unique situation here i don't know how many sandbags that man filled himself with holiday weekends and this man i mean so we're going to need a hands-on as they say a hands-on city manager because he's been out in the sh in the shrubs weed wagon and everything else how many people are going to actually do this job okay they probably think this is a super tight job i think you included that in there there's physical lay right to this job you think about okay there's five employees okay you're going to have to do something but he knows it and he knows all right because they do it and i think we did our best to try to get the point across without saying okay you're going to have blisters on your hands they might want to put that in the job description and the other thing that i think of putting a range in there you say 100 to 150 000 everyone that applies is going to expect 150 now so yes yes absolutely i negotiate every day i still i think your first statement don't agree with 100 we should have the salary range i mean where i came from every job within swift mud had a job description and a summer experience it was already set in stone you may reach that time right away you might not reach it for 10 years so is the place for that in the job description i think that's well then you're tapping their salary you should have put that in because it forces you to periodically reinvestigate the job description just to match the salary according to the cpi and sometimes it's best to leave those type of details out of the job description yeah for example you could you could go online and check out pinellas county every one of their jobs in there you could look it up and see here's the job description and here's the sound range a to b that's it you're going to get placed somewhere in between you're self selecting people here i was going to say and that language that you referenced earlier mike had said um dependent upon sound you know qualifications and experience etc but it's still going to be somewhere in that range but you also like joey almost everybody including myself when i would apply for a position and i saw that reigns i'm saying well i'm the best there is in the world so i know i'm gonna do that it's just and you may get it i mean the first week second week but i mean when people see bel air beach they may think oh my god we're going to be paying this guy 250 000 it's a high profile neighborhood i mean when i moved in here i had a this is a real quick story a sprinkler problem called the guy up and he goes i'd come right out so what are you charging at here she says what do you care you live in delray beach well thank you i mean this is the mindset of something so what we have currently is sally salary range and benefits depend upon qualifications experience and professional credentials so we just defined a range based upon your your experience and one person's range may be completely different than another person's range we specifically said range that would take out the word range everything else it's published right but i think with the job description and you'd ask earlier you know should that be in the job description and i can tell you from my experience all government agencies i've ever dealt with print and closed the salary range in the am not in the description in the description yes when we start bringing people in before they come in we ought to tell them the range is yeah does anybody say no thank you i would say up to yes up to another don't give a low number just up two yes sir it's just um just google real quick city of clearwater advertised and ranged 210 to 270 when they just replaced their city last year [Music] [Laughter] so it was so the question is is where in this process do we determine that is that with the criteria for hiring and weighting that stuff or in the post tell me where are we looking for the content you should post so the channel posted so you can make a modification for you absolutely it's modified posting or it can easily go in job description on the website somebody who's going to yeah i think applying and look at that he's immediately going to run to the website who's it where's this biller she's going to go to the website look at the job description it's posted on the job description that's already that's perfect something's something that's true that's perfect to put it right there and then they're probably going to pull a public records request for rent salary so so that makes sense so where and when are we going to do that because that doesn't exist right now does it doesn't have a salary arrangement job description we we don't have you know so lloyd's point in a lot of places the positions are like i'll say number to some degree like they'll say from salary level 12 to 20 also well that that's first someone to find out and actually smart candidate would the smart candidate would how's that yeah you've got 10 right patty and some of them wouldn't put their salary thank you for your service we need to find another example so so i think that needs to be embedded in p5 under the planning determines electric criteria i think there needs to be in their determined salary range i would think that the range would be first and then we would look through the ad and determine the uh the various skill sets that we mentioned in the ad and give them a rating as to how how each one impacts the potential for assad yeah what's the criteria you want to use for evaluating these packages and it starts with evaluating each one and depending on what we look at salaries between here and here because i think maybe we're inflating the twos we're really interested in right now updating the two things the advertisement and the job description now with that salary range getting out there from the public now yes we're not sure we need to go out and amend the posting the event conversion for the job if we just put that to the job description that would work i don't see any detriment to anybody as long as they do go to that editor let me uh let me pause for a second do we need a break yes okay let's let's do it five minutes all right okay we're back after five minutes and um we were discussing criteria for hiring and uh also coming up with some sort of a scoring system during that hiring process i'm looking at the ad that was written and the most part i think it's actually done very well does anyone have any problems with it the reason why i'm bringing this up is we really should just pick out the the key bullet points of this ad and use this as our ranking system where maybe everything has a a score and depending upon how you qualify for each one of these these skills skill sets we come up with a scoring system that treats everyone equally based upon their qualifications and experience education maybe even we look at their salary history i don't know but uh this is something that mr mayor what are you looking at and we're just trying to find another package or something i'm sorry i brought the ad with me does everyone else have it i think i don't think it was it's under 9. yeah i just i just yeah that's the existing job description and the ad is to do it um so i don't mind taking this on and trying to come up with a ranking system and then i'll send it out to everybody and at the next work session we'll just decide if it's acceptable and uh and then we'll add it to one of your boxes here i'm not sure exactly where that will fall but the whole purpose of the drill is to make sure we didn't forget anything set deadlines create ownership for some of these things and remove a lot of as much subjectivity as we can out of the process so that we know what we're going to look at we know how much weight that criteria has and everybody's treating the same rather than go in and start the interviews or whatever it was like oh that guy came across well okay sometimes um and i've interviewed hundreds of different positions and things like that um i don't want us to get just my personal opinion too much but we're just on a point system but sometimes you can do that and then you score the different candidates and then you look at it and it's like wow that person won i really think this person's going to do a better job because a lot of times you get that gut feel you know really in my opinion factors in a lot but sometimes that's not in the scoring system what would i would use this for this application uh process would be to pick up a top five something like that whenever we do the personal interviews uh that's what that's whenever you actually or you get to know them a little better excellent and there are ways around some of what you're talking about besides having maybe there's a another another evaluation which is just your subjective opinion on this guy gets a little like five percent of the weight of something because you like the way the guy came across or the way he answered a certain question that can be factored in and made too but when one way of doing this thing is but when you get the short list of their five top candidates rather than everybody just having like one vote you do this thing like multi-moving where you might have 10 votes every person has 10 votes for five applicants now if you want you can put all 10 year votes on one person or you can spread it out and so you start taking into account some of those individual subjective things there so there's different ways of uh skinning as you can taking care of something okay all right well i'll take a stab at this ranking system and then uh lynn and patty and then they can pass it around everyone and then we'll bring it back up with the next work session and everybody started thinking about if there's something else you need to add in there and start thinking about deadlines like you're you can work it backwards and come up with some strawberry lines i think these are called action items so i have one already it sounds like mike has one can we can we start sending out after this as a summary of action items and what would you like you know how they all should review this as well just kind of really cover a lot of things so what are you volunteering for i mean i'm i'm happy i think we all should review this so i don't think i mean i'm happy to do whatever needs to be done yeah now just for me it's like that my response i told these deadlines and i said that back to patty correct what was your final date no no what i said was that's still agreeable i'm planning to take a few days before memorial day and i'll come back and be here for the gm and work that out and then we'll do a bunch of workshops after we get through that and everything's gonna be dory and we've got so it'll probably be the first part of july if we need to fly you in for any reason do we have flexibility on our budget to do that yeah because i haven't used a lot of my budget you know i think i think the goal is we want to get as close as we can but i see two hard and fast decision points we need to do i think we need to do that criteria before we open the first application package and those are due may 23rd so we need to have something in place ready to go by may 23rd the the other thing i think is a key issue is updating the job description on the website we talked about salary ranges and we need to get that up asap so that when people start looking at the job posting and then goes into the website to look at the job description they're kind of aligned and i think that needs to take place in the next week or two we should be able to extrapolate that right out of this ad easily so who would like to take that action item and update the job description yes well we've got some of that that's that's part b that's right that's right well it was to discuss and figure out exactly how we were going is there something you so if you've got any comments just send those to me and i'll clean it up i see two things one is i don't think there's enough emphasis on being the point person or the city with uh emergency riders what you are the key man when it comes to hurricane preparation you're the guy who's sitting in on the county right where lots of water i'm not sure if when i look through the essential functions i don't really see that it says yeah you're the emergency guard but it doesn't really know that and then the other thing i see there is you use knowledge whereas in the posting we talked about demonstrating experience so i don't have a problem using both terms a guy has a knowledge or he has demonstrated experience i'm concerned that a person can sit in a webinar or a seminar or do an online course and all of a sudden he's got knowledge in emergency management or government budgets or whatever the purpose of the demonstrated experience is this guy has hands-on experience sitting down around the table and forced training budget line eyes and stuff not just he sat in our webinar and kind of got dealt with well that's what i'm saying if you do some edits to that that job description for the most part was written by the consultant we hired a couple years ago she came in and talked to us there's i did two or three edits because i thought you need to have some experience in a couple of those things but if you want some word smithy just then i got to give you guys a warning order here if you're looking at first of june you also get to give the incoming person the ability to give their job two weeks notice so you're looking at notifying that person on 13th may at the latest that they've won and they have to give their company two weeks notice so i just we're not we're not helpless we have an interim yeah and i think depending on when i'm taught this worst case scenario the level of the person that we're that we're going to eventually hire you know that person most likely will require more than two weeks you know it's not a low-level deal so if it's already a city manager and they say i'm gone in two weeks you know that's it he's not gonna be thrilled but uh yeah so that that could happen but that's kind of good what's next is it i hit the uh job description i'll take that one for action changes to your work on the deadline uh the uh the hard cut dates yep for various and uh what about interview questions is this something one of us should be working on something to add to it you look at you look at what's in here but what about the other questions the ones that aren't in here well maybe you need to decide upon is it going to be a group interview or are going to be individual interviews because i've seen it work both ways and what what they've done in the past is the citizens and the councilmembers they did phone interviews and that's when they kind of shortlisted the they went through that they went through the application which is kind of what you were doing today you get the criteria and then they did a phone interview and they have a list of questions as a member of professional association usually they publish those hey you know things to ask in your job interview do you have a list of those type they had a list of those questions and we'll pull those from the other and then don't you have a battery of questions you would ask did you do the job would it be great to get a battery of questions well the the things that the phone interview i think that's the preliminary time we set that up in the conference room did the phone call and now we have zoom makes it much easier yeah but that's how we did it or how another uh resource available to us is the icma yeah the city managers association you know made up of retired city managers and they don't help you interviewed all of you come up with questions or you can do all sorts of things we'll pull out the stuff we've used in the past maybe we should engage them and see if they have you know i think once we get to the short list um again i've been involved in a bunch of these and questions are nice you know we're going down to the short list i've seen it to be very effective when we're having like role-playing scenarios i can i can bury somebody in a role-play situation to see how they're going to react and that's important i want to see i mean they know questions they can they can say anything you answer a question you put them in a role play scenario where there's something actually happening you know we get all the good actors that work for the city and it can be impressive to see somebody who really shine and other people will just focus and you know it becomes obvious who maybe the best candidates are at that sort of a high stress oh my goodness my experience a lot of hr directors will tell you a lot of people can be a good actor a lot of questions come up with the answers to the other questions out there that's why we stress for like six months of probation and everything like that because you can't define that yeah and i think the important thing is we're not hiring the pope or supreme court judge here this is what's going to be interesting about this interview is that if any of any of these candidates have which i'm sure they all have city manager experience but they're not going to have is the type of experience this job requires yes yeah so it's going to be very interesting to see how this absolutely unfolds this is a unique job something we gloss over to is the city turning as a reward is to review the hiring contract i've drafted many of these i have some standard terms and conditions for council to consider i mean additionally say you've got that yes ma'am i'm under that accident all right is anyone reaching out to the city managers association well did we have enough just enough assignments to uh to prepare for the next meeting consensus yes yes that's not good about this so far all right we have no other comments let's take a clock right now so i think we're actually doing better than i expected all right number three review public uh records policy this was added to the agenda by jody shirley yeah sure um so i wanted to review what our current policy is because there have been so many public records my last um inquiry there were like 35 or something like that and each request actually i don't have everything an order over here so i can't even fill up the current policy but each request you know takes patty away from her job duties and she and and i can tell you just by the time you get an email you gotta research what it is they're looking for reply to the email and then pull up the information and you know send that information back she's probably not hitting the minimum um she's not charging anything she's not putting any time on the answering the initial email or anything like that i think we need to have not necessarily the minimum hours but minimum fee so because i think a lot of the requests are people don't put value upon our staff's time i think they're just haphazardly going oh can i get a copy of that contract not thinking through that patty's going to stop what she's doing to get the information to the resident or whoever it is requiring so my feeling is if i called in and asked paddy for something and she said there's a minimum 10 fee i would gladly pay it because i know it's going to take her away from her regular schedule so i just wanted to us to kind of think about that and how much time i mean at this point those requests she's had today probably she's lost a week's worth of work this year just providing people information that they called out that may you know maybe legitimate requests but i'm just saying there's time spent and it pulls time from our staff well 5.4 should really be strictly you want to you want a public information request but you should come up with at least a 50 percent or you have to get go before she starts she could she can do an estimate of hours if it's a public information request but like me i can do it estimated hours or any one of you guys are saying it's going to take me two hours this is my you need to come up with 50 percent because not the battery on the spot how many public information requests are presented she does all the work and no fees are ever paid and no information is ever going forward i have one i have a bill out there for almost a year right now and i assume that the person never paid for the public information there the law says that you can charge uh at the hourly rate the lowest hourly week rate of anybody who's going to actually do the job so obviously in this case patty's hourly rate you can ask for payment in advance in this case your policy talks about 50 what's really important about that is if there is actual documents that are created and the person never pays the city does not have to respond to another public records request from that person yes until then and that's kind of how there's some control over the public records request because they they do come pretty pretty voluminous so that's one way of dealing with those individuals but you absolutely can charge that and you absolutely can ask for it in advance and patty just has to determine what you think will be roughly or time period or actually use your hours and that's what i'm saying my past work experience you'd be gridlocking the city by just doing volume public information requests and then pick them up in goal for we have one person who's made a thousand public records right in the 12-month period can we also put that cancellation policy in there as well that the piece that you just mentioned if you fail to pay for what you've requested i mean we have here you will pay but if you fail to pay it should be in there as well yes done well 5.3 gives some guidance i mean we've talked about the 15 minutes and if it's more than 15 minutes you gave them a good faith estimate of what it's going to cost before you even go do something well i was trying to address what happens if they don't pay they've already made the request they made the copies they're sitting there and what you do with that person for future requests maybe the very thing is what's the time limit here's your bill to pay okay and you give it to them on the money you need to pay by friday is it legal to say the information request is dissolved until they're in which we knew it well i mean really the law in this area is very liberal towards the requested reason i mean they are there's a lot of cases and they talk about it's the public's right to seek public records within certain restrictions and the restrictions are basically what we talked about um you know time periods uh how much it would cost to do that but of course as i said you could ask somebody could come in every day and do a public records class and we would have to you would have to take it and deal with it and there's nothing you could do to stop that trump indicates it's all the time the problem is is trying to to give a good faith estimate and it's not there's no you don't you don't know what your in some cases you know where that record is and you can you can make a copy and hand it off to somebody in five minutes but other times i'm sure it takes hours to go find a certain record or is that is that the case for you right and it could also involve every department that is going to have to look for something too so yeah just to give a good faith estimate takes time and the unknown of what the record is because patty may have to redact it and that takes a lot of time right but she hasn't seen the record yet so by the time she gets it it could be additional what i'm saying is the wall says we give them a price if it exceeds that price we refund their money but she gets an information request she wants all citizen council emails that's going to take as you said not even weak it's going to take more than okay so well that you do you do provide the estimate right and if they're not willing to put up the money that's right then we do not have to resist that's my fault that is correct and i've seen that happen where we don't accurately track the true costs out there i mean patio take a public record request at work and i'd be willing to bet that 80 percent of times i've seen 15 minutes but there's no charge maybe we need like a worksheet when a request comes in is this going to take 15 minutes or less yes if it's more than 15 minutes you got to kind of estimate hey it's got to go interdepartmental it's going to take x number of hours to do it's going to take you a week or whatever you come up with some ballpark figure and that's you don't even start the process of doing that with practice requests you communicate right back to the person we estimate it's going to cost you 500 and if you wanted us to proceed on this we need an upfront deposit of x number of dollars and when we had that deposit we'll start executing i don't think there's anybody on the council that's what we do a 15-minute request shouldn't be given to somebody a document or whatever that's exactly that's where i'm having a problem is that i don't think anything should be free i think that they're taking fatty from her job her regular assigned duties and many of those requests aren't more than 15 minutes but it's still stopping her maybe and i'd say it's not more than 15 minutes because she's thinking okay well i make a copy and that didn't take me 15 minutes but from the initial i got she got an email she's got to do some she got to respond to the email she's got to go research that document they want provide it for them it's probably more than 15 minutes but she's just looking at that initial copy of okay 15 minutes and it didn't take advantage i think every request should have a minimum charge yeah i disagree with that because you're in double checking or wrong but you're negating the whole thing of freedom and you're already paying them front for services yeah the taxes pay for this weight like this would be against yeah in the case law talks about 15 minutes or a half hour in some cases and remember the other thing is is that i can make a public records request and i'm not copying it i'm just having i just want to look at it yeah and so that is supposed to be really at no charge unless it takes a long time so that you can pull it around so i should be able to come in if i follow her up and say i'd like to see the city manager's contract and just come in and look at it and not there should really be no charge advantage well the inspection of records is one thing but the time to consume that inspection is another right but it's going to make it it starts bogging you down yes and i'll talk to you more about this on wednesday but the one thing remember in a public records request lawsuit there's attorney's fees and costs that are awarded and a lot of times that's why we see these lawsuits because there's people out there that that's all they're doing attorneys are just making their living off of doing lawsuits like that fred riley did an excellent course in all that so patty question how many um public record requests have you had since the first year i believe like it's around 35 since the first of the year now i will say that they have almost come to a halt just recently so yeah yeah i just made a public records request for the sheriff's department recently and basically their language said the estimated charge is x if you want us to proceed go ahead and send us that amount of money now and if it's less than that we'll reimburse you and if it's more than that you're going to pay us a difference so more like a refundable deposit it could be or they could ask for more money they could say well we estimate is going to be 135 dollars turned out to be 250 euros 120. if you don't pay us we're not giving you the document yes that's covered under 5.50 you have a public records request and then they they give you the estimate right then and there yes all right i'm not 100 they may have sent me a separate email but the last one i got or the first one whichever the case made then it did include that cost so yeah so so the mechanism is actually there then it's just we haven't been emphasizing our authority to say this is the estimate you pay up did they give you a final dildo then saying an itemized bill saying this is worth it no they said it is there is an estimate and you you pre-pay it and if it's less then you get a refund and if that's money i'm curious petty are you currently logging the amount of time you spend from start to finish on each records request you receive like i know you've got a log of records requests but are you logging the time that you're spending on that record well basically what i do is what you all have been saying so like jody said if i have one that says i want to see the city manager's contract i get that all the time so i have it ready to go it takes me five minutes you know by the time i like andy said i acknowledged a request with a separate email then i actually do the request you know based on where it is in the workflow of requests if there's three requests ahead of it i don't do it right then but i send the acknowledgement of the request so then so i know that one's not going to take me time so i'm not tracking that i have one right now that i sent them an estimate of what the time would be and what the cost would be and let me know how you proceed would like to proceed and that's what you know i get those well this particular one uh has never responded and i've had a couple like that so you do all the work and they don't respond and you know how much time it takes and what the cost would be and then some of them do pay and then you know so when you say do i track the time well i'm wondering if you're recording enough data to where you have case histories of this type of records request will take me this long and so you now have a better quoted mechanism than just guessing i'm just wondering right and i understand what you're asking but each one except for the simple ones that are repetitive it's really hard to tell because you never know who else is going to be involved and what they're actually requesting because a lot of times they'll make a really broad request and you'll have to narrow them down you know i can give you what you're asking for but if you really have a specific question you know i can give you a better estimate of time and money it's kind of crazy it's almost like you have to do the records request in advance to be able to give them an estimate a little bit yeah you said mr mayor a lot of this stuff is repetitive so there should be some type of formula you know that's what i'm thinking and it's only a good faith i mean she says based on my experience of having done this over for the last 25 years this is how much time it's going to take to do that one therefore my hourly rate times this number of hours here's my good day destiny this is what it's going to cost give me 50 deposit and if you want me to proceed that's good you had a comment can you have some sort of a lot that goes with the request like if you had to turn the request over to kyle or something for him to look something that he puts down his time and stuff and when you get it back then we can charge them right now i usually go to the department and ask them you know i i don't have a log but i do i just ask them how long do you think this will take 15 minutes or less and you know so now i don't have a log that's a valid administrative point typically when when you staff things out in many offices there's a cover sheet that goes on it you pass it to the next department and he says okay i got it on this date i spent two and a half hours on it and then it goes to the next guy and you get it back and that's complete you add up the hours and there's the final cost is there is if the public information request comes in and we say it's going to cost 500 but then at the end of the day it's only a hundred dollars is that a gross violation of over excessive fees i didn't see that in no but if you're doing something that would in essence um prohibit or curb somebody from getting refreshed right so we have to be i'd rather underestimate than over us what i'm just saying is there case law saying they keep charging us well over the estimate of cost there's not a i don't i looked at this recently i didn't see a case that talked about that there have been challenges to costs and that and that we've seen and fairly often when they're when they're excessive and there's a thousand dollars like that there'll be challenges to that on the hourly rate they'll require you to show who who is the person are they the lowest hourly rate of somebody who's actually doing the job and have to come up with that documentation and support remember down that road recently right so patty did you say that there has been and there are times when you will tell them what the cost is and then you'll go ahead and do the work and then they don't come by to pick it up no we just estimate the cost as best as we can right and no we don't do the work yeah and i'm very specific like if i ask finance don't do it just give me an approximate time of how how long you think it might take you a lot of people will not pay so i guess the question is is uh i mean it sounds like we're wanting to change something but what is it that we're that we should change about our current system my opinion i think that just doing a better job of documenting our actual time spent and then having yes the change i think would be to prepay rather than a deposit [Music] you know how he doesn't use it all up then they refund it for at least you know there's not the chances of they've done all this work and it doesn't get picked up so no 50 are 100 based upon the estimate but it has to be reasonable we have to add something in here that says it turns out to be less than that we'll give you some of your money back all right yeah the verb need to be changed a little bit probably throughout the entire document we'll make those changes anything else on this topic now we are up to discussing the american rescue plan act market funds to take away city manager reads yes uh mayor constantly arpa funds we've got our first uh positive we got 401 000 last fall and we're going to get a total of 800 2 868 we haven't used any of those funds yet there's a report to the end of april that i have to submit to them but we haven't exercised what we want to do with those the console so what the citizens advisory career committee recommended issues for the storm water and then taking some of the storm water funds that we've projected to use for the belt boulevard that cost and later in here i'll explain that to you but at this point all i need from the console is you know is the direction still you use it for strong water consensus that's one of the areas and we'll go ahead and do the report that way and then when we move it forward with that the first bid we got in for stormwater projects is we've got a budget of about 520 000 for this project on 12th and 13th street came in at 720 000. i was looking a little bit i've talked to the engineer about it in the design workforce he said it seems like a reasonable number based on what's happening and based on a couple things that happened that we'll talk about uh number six dude uh updated numbers going up thirty percent yes right you know just brief question stormwater i just want to make sure that's in concurrence with our strategic plan yeah yeah okay and and the arpa funds stormwater is one of the projects you can use the money for so can you just brief review of everything that storm water that applies to storm water drainage uh storm water is the curbs and then any piping or a drainage system the paving is a separate separate thing and the bid that came in as i said came in uh yeah the low bid came in at 717 340. because material costs are going up they're saying everything's going up what was the highway uh 821 000. we only got two bids so this was for 12 and 13. right right so i'll talk to the engineer a little more we may around the two sea walls and that's over the budget that we have available i mean it's just crazy well with the storm water money or the arc of money you know we could we've already budgeted the 520 maybe we'd take some of the artwork towards that to finish but until we get to that point because just the cost of fuel alone is is staggering oh no no i'm not i mean it's every you know and i expected the bids to go up so in the budget that i'm getting ready to present to the citizens advisory committee tomorrow night preliminary budget we're going to have to go back into those half years and bump that up so it's not going to slow down but i guess we projected in our capital budget x amount of dollars for the projects and with the arc of money we could probably take the difference if we use that make it work for a few of the projects but it's not going to help the adopters but that's that's where we're at so i just wanted to get a consensus from the console because we did talk about using it for strong water but we still do that as a consensus i have no problem that storm water drainage is is something that i think most of us have committed to one unless someone has a different idea no i concur are there any uh contracts out there i know like for example the pavement a lot of the other counties will put the language in there to where another government agency can piggyback these are more job-specific but for maybe the guttering do any of the um are there any other contracts out there we may be able to piggyback and hopefully well we may be able to i don't know if those costs have went up in those contracts because there's probably some kind of escalation in uh same with payday we does anyone expect the cost of moving forward to go down at all no well here's here's where i'm going with this we've got a reserve right now and i know it's safer we shouldn't ever consider touching it but actually we've discussed several times on this council and on the last council that is that money serving us appropriately are we getting any bang for buck or just sitting in the bank and with a cost of we might be in six months but not now right but the cost of everything going up i mean it's and we don't think it's going to blow come back down should we maybe consider tapping into some of that to accelerate these projects get them out of the way so that we're set for the next 10 to 20 years rather than it looks like right now what we're doing is we're struggling to find out how to pay for these projects and i don't know to what extent we would want to move forward on this but it's something that i would i would certainly entertain or experience hyperinflation but we experienced that back in the late 70s and then didn't correct itself i mean i i can't see this balloon taking much more air i mean oil right now is trading with a 94 bucks in the barrel which it was trading back in january with gas is only 290 gallons you couldn't give it away for a while well that was that was march about 2020. yeah ten dollars but what i'm saying is i i don't see how this is this bubble is going to keep blowing up uh you make a good point i mean if i'm wrong man we're a little screwed but i mean and hold everybody that that brings up the real specter is and i've been looking at the forecasts as inflation goes up the housing bubble obviously kind of it's going to pop the housing appraisals will drop precipitously and that's really the key source of our income yeah but they only drop whenever you do a project or you sell your home they raise or lower they it's a gradual thing even though the the uh the cost of homes is going up someone walks into this market and they bought from someone who's owned their house for 10 years all of a sudden they get that that major tax increase but it doesn't i don't think it's a all at once you know rise or fall into the forecast though it's a component that is regularly inserted in forecasts and we need to know that i think the jury is kind of in there you know one line of thinking is that the tamp area is catching up to places like boston so yeah i guess the jury that i don't i do like their idea that celebrating some stuff because that big a lot of cats who got sitting in the bank right now right so well another thing that i think about is okay this is an emergency fund this is supposed to be used in the event of an emergency but if we're not able to effectively drain as much as we can during one of these storms it's going to cause more damage and cost us more money in the long run if we do have a big storm so just throwing it out there to see what everybody thinks because i talked about developing a protocol or a criteria where we can apply those emergency reserve funds for projects as long as we say okay well we're going to pay it back in two years or something like that he's getting a good handle on his capital projects and also prioritizing and looking at the timeline there so i guess at a natural extension today to start putting that burr rate and come up with different scenarios and then we can make an important decision well with uh i think we can take the harper money and use it as a filler i mean it's a gift so oh yeah yeah we absolutely should take that i mean definitely and i think using it for storm because there's so few things we can use it for which is also why the cost of all this pipe is so expensive because the federal government's open their pocketbook so every city in the nation is doing just what we're doing with federal funds so prices are going to go skyrocketing but last time we talked about using the reserve we also discussed if we use that reserve having to place a line of credit for emergency purposes and i don't think that went anywhere but we probably should look at that again so if we if we use up the reserves to get some of these projects accelerated we should have a source if we have a hurricane and we need funds quitters we have a line of credit in place ryan's no longer in the banking business what's your total research right now i'll call it unfunded reserves is about a little over 2.3 million it's not committed anything okay as an example you've got a million-dollar reserve that's committed i don't operating budget and that's like five hundred fifty thousand i'd be off there but those are things that we subtract our cash well what i'm saying is that there is a major storm god forbid uh that two million dollars is going to be amazing anyway for any federal well there's a major storm for the city you pretty much mostly debris removal you know our maintenance building signage and stuff like that one of the biggest problems you'll have is all of these homes that have power lines behind their houses there's no access there's no way to get to them and they all have trees growing all around the lines so if we have a huge wind event it'll they'll be without power for a very long time yeah well you can tell that last time if you will [Music] from duke to do this the only way the only way that they will assist is if they already have a project employer or scheduled to do upgrades on existing infrastructure so let's say that they've got a line running behind behind someone's house and they want to increase the capacity well if you wanted to underground while they were doing that they would use the money that they set aside for their project to offset the undergrounding but you're they're never going to pay for a major portion of it no we got a for bei i think i got like an eighty thousand dollar trade that's that's what i buy but hey that's 80 000. let's so i gather the consensus for the harper funds for now is to use it for store water storm water and we'll use it as a door and once i get a better a little more discussion with the engineer i decided to go out to good again or just take move forward okay and that's the good news and now the bad news the bad news which is the next topic well the code profile okay well the bad news is i have uh the house on 25th street which i'm sure a lot of you see that's been standing there for the corner of 25th and i was well he ran out of his time a year ago over a year ago the city allows 18 months plus a six-month extension we gave him an eight-month extension because of the pending he didn't accomplish months in the eighth month extension i think he did get his win as an environmental right okay but that was in the pandemic extension so i hated it too well that's recent so we took him to code magistrate in january of last year uh he was given until august 31st to complete or there was a 100 a day fine that didn't happen and at the same time he was told to give us a schedule um we're gonna make this the rough enemy like rough into this and if you fail to meet the schedule then there's a 25 day line for each one of those linebackers so this is the schedule of canvas he didn't meet any of it and the schedule ran out august 31st last year so at this point recently a couple of his fines have stopped he got the mechanical rough hand electrical rook and the plumbing those are fast inspections well with interest and fines and this set together this total fine as of the end of march was 124 thousand nine hundred dollars we have another gentleman that his house and failed to pay the rental registration two years in a row last year so we took him to magistrate finance gave a fine with 75 dollars a day until he bought a current he didn't he didn't do anything the address he had on the house for his mail you know where to send me was the rental house of course he claims the just to give you an example these are the letters that we've sent to this individual a lot of them came back with address unknown or some of them somebody signed for uh and the only thing they paid for was the permit oh i had the papers uh 300. okay so he didn't do that well now his fines up to 28 000. his fine didn't stop but this is where we round from the ground problem this gentleman came to me and uh said good conversation so what he's offering the city is i'm offering to give you two thousand dollars to settle this claim and that's typically negotiating something i don't know where the council's at with that well 28 000 right now okay so there are firms out there in fact whenever i went to the mayor's council luncheon at christmas there were two law firms sitting outside the head table set up and they were looking for municipalities willing to sell those lanes for cash and i think we should look into it because we'll never get the amount that they owe us but if we even got a fraction of it that's better than what we're getting now well is is an example i negotiated with him and he ended up paying us 5 000 which is about 50 percent so and then the other big one we have is a short term well that's the house that's on bay shore uh that they printed and then we caught them and then i catch them again the sea wall fell in on them they had sale of the house and my understanding right now that sale of the house is some kind of litigation is the guy that wanted to buy the house they tried to back out of it he had a contract on it and then seawall there was some conflict there and i don't know if it's still under litigation the shanks paid us a couple thousand dollars but from what they indicated to me is until this issue with the contract on the house is settled they can't sell it so i guess it's in some kind of a real estate standpoint so those are the big ones uh we've got a small one the south's on the corners got a 480 she's getting ready to get more than that because we took her to the magistrate she had 30 days to get the swimming pool cleaned up that ended march 13th so they kept finding 75 so uh her fine's probably going to go up too but couple of um that harbor the harbor drivers of what you said the one with the seawall that fell in fact okay um what what is the status of it have they quit renting it have they put unfortunately i was the one that was the guy that was catching at the time because it would happen on a weekend but they're not doing it now now the house every once in a while i'll see someone over there so i know they're bringing some people in but it may be relatives or something oh no it's the author's daughter and then they have a maintenance guy that comes there the background on that the husband is in taiwan and can't leave the country until [Music] i don't think you could buy it i think the title companies hold will hold it up well the problem the problem is is uh you never remember the guy's name the guy that wanted to buy it you really want to buy it because i mean i've talked to him probably four or five months ago just trying to figure out a way to get a hold of him but my understanding is they're gonna pay some money to thailand government to let him leave so and that's what the daughter told me also when she came in and paid so that's that's where you know and i've talked to andy about a couple of these uh especially the people and you know the owner basically told me i'm not paying so the problem is even if you sold the lead it's still collecting fines and stuff so i mean we're still working on it yeah he gets a bill we mainly will build i mean i like the idea like i mean we're still doing the same work we still have the same problem it's not going away if we sell the lean you start holding it back well i think the for that house doesn't it stop if that was if that lane went away that's the end of their fines correct you know what they're fines that they're getting they're they're not violating anything else it resets the club not until not until he completes the task that the manchester and he hasn't done that now the story is i've been in contact with the guy that's helped me because in the last month there's been a little more activity there i'm not talking about 25th i'm talking about bayshore oh bayshore is something to do with a legal issue but they can't sell it just i know based on what the daughter told me they would sell but they can't because what are they the ones that offer this 2000 no that's the guy that's renting the house took him to the magistrate because he wouldn't respond to us and the magistrate charged him 75 a day so it's now that five stopped paid last year's rental registration in this year's and the bad check that he gave us well i think we kind of set a standard like we did with esa or you know give us 50 and and that's typically what happens typically when you have a co-violation unless the code fines get to the point where it's that's probably all we would get out of a collection service anyway yeah you can file sue normally what happens when you file and then they'll come and try to negotiate something i think the frustration that then was having with some of these is that they just wouldn't move full response i mean if you're willing to take 50 or negotiate it that's great you don't have to go any further but sometimes you have to file suit just to get their attention right i think the uh he's now changed an address to where he's at so whatever but what woke him up was he sent him check in for a hundred bucks for the federal registration this year but there was an address on it and we sent him the lean notice and all of a sudden he shows up but all this time he's claiming he never got any of our mail the wretcher didn't do it i mean we've got pictures we've posted so he came back and said well i'll pay you and i did talk about it he says i'll pay you for what the city expended and i said well you make an offer you can do but i'll tell you i did tell you that the council in the past has used the leverage of 50 are we ready to pull the trigger on these other ones to file a suit and we'll bring them to the negotiation table it's whatever council wants to do but we have no problem doing that i have some ending right now that i've done recently for gulfport so one we didn't get any response that's what we were able to resolve is that the purpose of this discussion no problem with that um i just want to make sure that we're getting the most bang for so i still think it'd be a good idea just to reach out to i may i may still have a card and i'll give it to you or at least in the contact information and let's see i mean it never hurts to listen just to see what they have because whichever one puts more money back into the city's pocket i so you know as far as the guy with the rental i mean i'm just telling you what you've done in the past what you'll have to do that's step one is the 50 percent offer maybe the other thing we can do with some of these is do just a letter um from my office and don't contact the city manager of the next days you've been authorized to move forward with legal action that's probably the most economical solution i think each one has a different scenario i don't think that's going to motivate the guy that's under construction so i don't know how i mean i think each one has to be handled differently well we could do that as a courtesy so that anybody who comes before you says well i can't believe the city before just filed suit no c major has been in touch with you got another letter from the city attorney's office and then he files curious uh do you think this this guy is building his house with cash and he's taking his time well he may be but he's wasted a lot of money i'm just just to give you a quick scenario he put all the candle lights in the ceiling okay evidently went in one day well i don't like those cam lights so he told the electrician to come in and tear them all back down and throw over the fog and they threw them away cam lights had never even been used and then you put new camera outside probably could have paid us fine with those well i mean this is the things that i'm doing and i probably have more intimate knowledge of all this because i spent more time trying to do his house stuff and you know he his permit expired so he's got these spines going um and say you know you need to post a completion bond or something like that i get a little creative with that because it gives you something to look forward to because he's going to keep telling him to get it done he's not going to get done so now he says he's going to get his person he has a brother that lives here he lives on harrison okay he's he's going to get he's got someone working on the house and bob the owner of the house is out of it because i will say over the last two or three weeks there's been a lot of activity there as i check it out pre-regular and you know the plumbers are there the electrician's there the wire's being pulled i mean that's an inexpensive way to make sure the problem gets done he does a completion bond that has a you know your job's not done by whatever it is december 31st we take the bond we complete the house you know whatever so so we're at uh right now they're talking july and let's let's move forward with that everybody else agree i know we've got three minutes do we have time to move over to the duke the boulevard underground yeah okay okay dude came we we've got about four million dollars to do our undergrad on golfball that's that's the pennies year of that right now we were eligible for like 1.4 million of that money one million of that money is coming from bellar shore that agreed to let us use it like we did in the past so i think at this point with all this escalation and pricing that what we're going to probably need to do back to duke about these numbers because they sent me updated numbers and told me on the first phase she is looking at those numbers because what was recommended we'd split the stuff north of causeway into two phases and then she came back with this split sections that wasn't the intent so they are re-looking at the numbers and then the last sheet of that packet of stuff that's from the guy that i used for ddi uh he hasn't he was selected off a contract for him for indian rock speech so i think we can jump off that contract but i think where we're at right now if we can get this duke number back down for a little bit anyway off the first phase i think maybe we should take some pressure and try to get this portion done and go as far as that money takes us down north boulevard i really think based on what i'm hearing from the other cities that uh the money that the county gave us to 35 million is i saw the same problem in treasure island what what they were expecting is not what they're able to afford and it's duke who's not willing to move they're not willing to change anything i don't even know why they would be willing to break this up into four phases now all that does is raises our costs it means they have other projects they're wanting to satisfy at the same time and they're wanting their crew to bounce around and they need to come here and work and and just be prepared to knock out either the north or the south and you know what is the most the money we have we probably have to let's see if we can get this number back down closer to the million that she gave me initially 1.1 then we're like 1.80 for the first phase we'd probably have to take 400 000 reserves but we'll get that reimbursed well what's happening is that money from the county the 1.3 million yes we have to go spend it but the reimbursement is within 30 days so you know we did that with these other projects so we aren't really on the hook for anything because we're negotiating by ourselves with duke and this project includes other cities along the beach as well yeah what can we be negotiating as a team all of us versus them we tried that and the thing came back duke's number came back they even hired consultant because we were gonna try to get the county to just do it for us right and that didn't work well and if you do that and they're going to want to recruit great on their franchise fee so so what happened was we went uh all cities were given a fake money for each city like cars was three million fellow children indian rocks is i think four or five million and i can send you that list of how much it was but it's being paid to us over five years the first year they gave us like 400 000. this year they gave us 900 so uh dollar short values together and then october 1st we'll get another 900 so you already have numbers in your mind where we should just require a different goal i think we go as far as we can when guiding money runs so we talked about this in the advisory committee i had some questions that i wanted some calculations on you're able to get that information and i don't know but it can't work so we'll get into about the maybe we call it the per foot price along gulf boulevard and how does that break down between the two cities and who's paying what share so we make sure that everyone's it's being made for the shortfall of being paid oh okay you're talking about the based on what i know from the previous project we got bellar shores monday it took cross wires and the cost to take their stuff down on the other side was less right but if we have a hundred feet of frontage of golf boulevard it doesn't matter if bellar shores is on one side we're on the other side we're beautifying golf boulevard 50 50 doesn't matter what cross did they were getting the services from that crossing it wasn't we didn't benefit from it they did plus all the lines that came down over there so i you know i think there's a there's a calculation there that we're missing and if there's a 500 000 short problem there may be an opportunity that they might be responsible for some of that if we actually took the entire stretch of gulf boulevard and looked at how many fun how much we've collected and how much we spent on that side how much we spent just it doesn't matter which side it is because we all are benefit right how many how many feet how many linear feet does belair shores stretch along the golf ball what's the entire project cost that's how the money is broken up by this stretch that's how is that how the county came up with their but my point is we have a shortfall we can't complete the project and you're asking us to spend all of our money and i just want to make sure that if we agree to drop another 500 000 or whatever that dollar amount is that we know for sure that we're the ones responsible there could be some responsibility from bella shores and i don't want to open this can of worms but i'm just saying i need to know in my mind for sure so i'd like to see the entire and i asked you this before the entire budget for the whole thing how much money have we gotten so far how much money do we expect to get from dollar shores so what you're saying is on the south side the project should have been a 50 50. right yeah because that's that's a that's where everybody both sides is ending in the entire span right what about the argument of how many houses on there's only 40 houses on the east west side and there's 80 houses on the east side well because they're not doing anything with the lines that are feeding the homes they're only doing the main lines although i understand that but i'm just saying they all goes there they're not the residents so basically the portion of gulf boulevard where we interface 50-50 that makes sense it should be 50-50 both ways and then where belair schwarzenegger well okay now i will say this that they whenever uh whenever duke is quoting these projects they look at what side of the street and they the number of drops and things like that i do that's why they're not willing to bend much whenever they're you may not like where they're going to put one of those pedestals or transformers on the ground but they're not willing to give much they're not willing to to move things around to accommodate they're very strict on their costing i found that out whenever i was speaking to a guy down at treasure island um hth hardy i'm just curious i mean i'd like to see i know and maybe i'm way off base on this but i mean i just kind of that's why i wanted to talk a little bit more about it you know but they gave us all the money yeah because they don't well you got to look at it they they're giving us a million here plus whatever they use last time i don't know we're just talking about the south south of the line at this point right so that's what i'm talking about related questions uh there's still some crosswire most of those are already paid for to be gone right but we don't seem to have any leverage we paid for this stuff and it just sits there and since there it sits there is there any leverage we can have to check part of the problem respecting right now is i think i'm on my third superintendent in the last three years and all of a sudden so i have a follow-up question today on some of those cross wires if you because they're personal property of their shore no those are street lights they're provided by dude right yeah so what was your first question county contracts for those is that right we pay for our side they pay for theirs okay take down crosswalks going across on the street and the vast majority of our bond the few onesies tuesdays are left are owned by the cable company we paid upfront to have these things removed and then okay perhaps should that be a legal request by the city manager request well the utilities are tough to get well do you remember well it was they were it was a blast thing they didn't do anything while everything was being uh dug out and plumped and all that they waited [Music] but is it is it time for a strong letter to the public utilities commission or they are controlled so fcc who i mean a letter to somebody and or is there some way to i try and have some super performance frontier and you know what it got me nowhere i can tell you right now the wire the cable wire coming into my house is direct there's no conduit around it or anything they completely missed my house and because they did all the undergrounding over a weekend or something i came back and had no internet television made a phone call they sent a kid out with some kind of a tool and he underground trench a wire and to this date i still have an orange wire running down the side of my house but at least i have cable do you have this is what you're dealing with so you're going to um contact duke and see if you've already talked to him she's coming back you're waiting on on that and then you're also going to look into just to make sure everything's fair yeah and did you have any other questions from us i just you know what i wanted to ask is the consensus to go ahead and go as far as we can because they're saying this bid is only good for six months right well for the most part i mean i think he did a really good job and he was willing to come back i think we all agree that we want this done we just want to make sure we're not everybody okay with that i agree with tony though i mean i really like looking members to make sure that um yeah because some of the money that was spent for them okay so uh i tried to commit to a 9 pm heart cut but i felt like this was pretty important to discuss this and i think it was great meeting everyone who have a motion to adjourn everyone"
