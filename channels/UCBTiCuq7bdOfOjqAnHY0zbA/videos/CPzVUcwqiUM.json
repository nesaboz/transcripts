domestic related incident possession and narcotics and then a warrant for rest for Deputy activity for that month we had 603 total events leading that was directed patrols and traffic enforcement for crashes we had three two were at Gulf Boulevard and Causeway and another one was at 2000 Gulf Boulevard and then finally there were 149 citations and warnings issued for that month and it looks like

thank you do you have any uh details I'm just curious on the causeway and Gulf Boulevard accident I don't have any specific details for that I do not no problem any other questions or comments no thank you Sergeant I appreciate it thank you right now we're on to the code enforcement monthly report good evening Steve klatka for the record um as far as the code enforcement for the month of March we did some different things this time around I did spend one day out on the water with Marine deputy and we actually went throughout the whole city checking out uh we've had some issues with some docs uh we did find four violations that we are working on now the other issue we've had is a short-term rental uh we're having on 13th Street since December up until today uh we've had four violations and three of those violations were actually done in the last week those reports are have been filed and will be sent to the city manager to set up for uh a hearing on that particular home other than that we have done a lot of cleanup with a lot of the residents uh and one of them particularly on 21st Street we finally got the the house cleaned up we're working on a couple more one on 17th and one on on Sixth but those slow process but we're getting done other than that we had a few more complaints as far as construction licensing and no permits which have been addressed and taken care of through the building department and Licensing Board foreign sure um two questions uh they're both on the second page why is the burglary to Residents a code violation well and same with the follow-on after that solicitor yes what had happened was if if there's a call for service I was right down the street from that so I responded to it so I actually handled it um it actually turned out to be um that solicitor handing out materials out on the street so unfortunately because the way the call is classified we have to reclassify it and then I I met with the individual because we caught them up on Howard uh and issued him a warning as far as no solicitation within the city limits whatsoever okay thank you other questions or comments yes Miss Livingstone there's an error on your monthly code enforcement report you're showing unpermitted remodel at 112 6th Street I believe you mean 113 if you want to review that please uh okay I didn't catch that which which page is that on it's on the first page put down towards the bottom uh okay we will correct that thank you thank you any other questions or comments nope thank you Deputy I appreciate it have a good evening thank you all right we are up to item four which is a presentation from Heather guadali CPA of Andrew Tess CPA LLC of the fiscal year 2022 Financial overview thank you Mr Mayor thank you all for inviting me to speak this evening I know you have a lot going on so I'll go quickly I'm going to provide a quick overview of the budget in actual for 22. I'm going to discuss some items I'd like you to consider as we start developing the budget for the upcoming year so these are my numbers these are my numbers people um these spreadsheets on here are Pages out of the audit that you received the draft last month um so the first one is the general fund it's the main operating fund of the city um you'll see here that all areas of Revenue were over budget so they were favorable variances and then below that you'll see that all areas of the expenditures were under budget so you had positive results in both um so the very first line is the adblorm taxes that's the largest single item of revenue for the city um so when you start to consider um the budget for 24. I just wanted to point out that historically we've budgeted 96 of the ad valorem taxes that could be collected and the reason for that is that we um we're expecting that all residents are going to take advantage of the early payment discount so if you can picture on your tax bill um like the November payment amount is less and then as you get closer to March it gets up to the full amount so it's a very conservative way to budget um you know we'll you see on here that we were over the budgeted amount and that's because not everybody did take advantage of that early payment discount um so on June 1st we'll get the first estimate of the taxable values of your city and then we'll start the process of establishing the military from there um the at the podium that you've got tonight is the full budget calendar and then my last slide is just a couple of highlighted dates that I'd like you to put on your calendars so if we keep on going down the list you'll see the franchise fees and utility taxes that's from Duke Energy Pinellas County Utilities below that is intergovernmental Revenue that state-derived Revenue that gets passed on to us we've got charges for services that's a big number that's the garbage and refuse from Pinellas County Utilities um that that particular number is shown as Revenue at the top and then it gets offset by the amount that we pay to waste management down in the expenditures we've also gotten that charges for services are the community center rentals site plan reviews The Marina payment that gets transferred to the general fund and then code violation fees and as you know the auditor commented during his presentation and then also actually in the note disclosures in the financial statements this year we've bought a resident that has a substantial amount in code violations that are owed to the city um just as part of the disclosure requirements that was a big increase from a prior year so we had to include that in the audit report um we don't have an allowance against that amount so there's not a reduction shown in the amount that we're anticipating being received at the time that the audit report was done and even you know through date um there's no indication that any amount is going to be forgiven so that full amount is shown in the accounting records at this point in time um and just so you know when that case is settled if the full amount is not received will will show a bad debt expense at that point in time so I know that's going to have to be on your radar coming up it is a substantial amount so if we keep on going down the line below that is fine those are parking tickets licenses and permits are the beach parking passes parking meters registrations we've got interest on investments which was um well over budget that's because of higher interest rates than we have projected and the SBA even this year every month is increasing the interest rate so that's very good um and then lastly is miscellaneous the bulk of that amount for this year of 22 was the insurance payment that we got for the sun fell down out front so that's a higher number than normal so if we keep on moving down the list you've got the expenditures and each line item here is a summarization of a lot of accounts within you know a lot of all the Departments we've got General government and that number is made out of the city council expenses the clerk finance non-departmental and I.T it all gets summarized into that number there about Public Safety so that's police protection and code enforcement physical environment as Public Works in the trash culture and recreation is the park maintenance and library card reimbursements and then you get down to Capital outlay and so you'll see that we were under budget for that and that's because all the projects that were budgeted weren't started during the year um so when this happens we monitor that amount it's kind of like a savings account we're earmarking the money that's left in this fund we're saving it up and then when the expense comes we know that we have accounted for that money in past years where statement up um or we abandoned the project that doesn't happen a lot here you guys pretty good at sticking to the plan um so the largest impact on this one was not making the anticipated transfers to the other funds um so you'll see here that the general fund had um and this changed from the draft to the actual on your paper it says deficiency of revenues under expenditures but it was actually revenues exceeded um the expenditure so this as you can see was the draft and that has been fixed but so it was a big year for the general fund um but by the time the fiscal year 23 budget was prepared we had a lot closer estimate of the timing of the big project so we know that um although they didn't start in 22 the money will be needed you know in this year 23. so at the very bottom you'll see the end of the year fund balance is over 5.4 million so it's a it's a very healthy amount left in that fund you want to ask questions right now or you want me to keep on going any questions uh Mr Banker did I hear you right you said that miscellaneous that was because of the sign out front a lot of it is yep you know how much um I want to say in excess of thirty thousand dollars you got for that I thought we were received a uh Insurance windfall of over 35. okay it could have been 35. no I mean so that would be a plus wouldn't it I'm sorry wouldn't that be a plus that would that that's the money that we got back on it what no it wasn't that much in excess of the cost of the new sign no we got reimbursed and then we spent the money on a new on that new sign so there's a so if we got 35 in the new signed cost is 40 there should only be a five thousand dollars well so I can't we can't show the revenue and then cancel out that Revenue because then it doesn't really show the full picture um so we have to show it as revenue and then a separate expenditure so it'll be in two different places okay okay yeah that leaves up my question I just you know concern where you booked it so when we're going forward into the budget process we're going to understand that this is not really a windfall that it's already offset and not to bank on that uh Second One and this is more personal can you double the font sizes on these things we're trying to make decisions up here and most of us really can't read oh okay sure thanks foreign next we have the capital projects fun so the revenue here is intergovernmental revenue and you'll see that there's a big budget amount here um that includes our Penny money and then the amount that would have gone to Bel Air Shores for the Gulf Boulevard undergrounding project and that gets diverted to us because we're overseeing the project I say we but it's not me I don't want to make any uh misunderstanding there um so we had about 930 000 budgeted as reimbursement revenue from that and then that offsets the same amount and expenditures down below um when you see the line item for Capital outlay that's also a big number so there's 930 000 in revenue and then 930 000 in the expenditure again the same concept as what we were discussing um you got to show it separately so that project is well underway this year as you know over a million dollars has been spent so far we've gotten back about 966 thousand dollars in reimbursements from Pinellas County and then we'll submit for the next reimbursement when phase one is finished so for this year 23 we'll have much higher revenue and much higher expenditures um than you're seeing here in these numbers um the capital outlay in this fund it had the audio visual video video upgrades here some boat ramps sea walls um and then in the budgeted amounts it's another you know Savings Program we're saving for the roof on this building and the carpet and um some sea walls and street lights and and things like that so um things to consider as you're moving forward the projects that you're you want to move forward with um The Debt Service here is The Debt Service on this building the city hall and then the special assessment bonds and then moving further down the page um no transfers were needed from the general fund because the big projects weren't started we have budgeted for Street resurfacing street lights brick Bridge work but it didn't need that influx of money yet so the bottom line of this fund is that we actually use about sixty one thousand dollars but there's still over six hundred thousand dollars left in this fund any questions before I move on Council okay next up is the marina fund so the revenue here is charges for services so it's the slip rentals parking fees um we were under budget a little bit because the um the parking fees were a little bit less than we had expected um if you recall after the beaches opened when we were in the middle of covid we had a huge amount of parking Revenue city-wide so that's been dropping off a little bit people have to go back to work um and so the new rates the new rentals are in effect this month all the renters have been notified uh most of the costs in this fund like the very first line says materials and supplies and a lot of what makes up that number is the we budget whatever amount we're projecting as profit in this fund we transfer that to the general fund and that's what makes it the most expense here um and so we've as long as I've been here we've made that full the marina fund has been able to make that full transfer to the general fund um so even with that full budgeted transfer being made the marina fund made another ten thousand dollars in profit and then they're still as you can see about 365 000 in this fund any questions I'll talk to this one okay and then here we have the storm water fund um the storm water assessment Revenue comes to us from Pinellas County Utilities you'll see that we have Personnel Services here um it was the actual expenses were thirty two thousand eighty dollars and fifty cents the Auditors rounded up and that drives my OCD crazy you'll see that it's one dollar under or over um that won't happen again so that's 15 of the Public Works salaries we move over to the storm water fund um and as you move forward with the budgeting process I you know I feel comfortable with that amount again you can discuss it as you get to that point we have contractual services that one was significantly under budget because we had planned on spending over a hundred over 105 000 on the npdes compliance and then the city ended up doing that analysis in-house that was a big project Kyle did a great job um I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to say that he's doing a great job in my presentation tonight but here it is um and Patty too and Laura and everybody here really I mean honestly it's a great place to work and um I know you don't ever get to hear that from my perspective but it's worth saying I feel very fortunate to work here so next is depreciation um this fund was new in 21 it was the first year so we didn't when we were developing the budget for this year we didn't really have a great idea of what that number should have been but for the budget in 23 we did include depreciation and we have a much better idea going forward um but when you look at this on the whole you know that number was over budget but then the contractual Services was under so they offset so we're still within the the rules [Music] um so you've had a lot of discussions about the storm water improvements and that will continue um so I won't go into it um but we do have good numbers to develop the budget for the upcoming year and this fund it did come close to sustaining itself it only had a loss of two thousand seven hundred and forty dollars but then it did need um 25 000 transferred from the general fund um and then the remaining fund volunteers 1.7 million but that's not cash that's the infrastructure of that storm water system so you'll be talking about taking on debt for the upcoming improvements to accelerate that plan um again not trying to steal Chris Rose Thunder um any questions on this one Council no I no I do have a question what are we depreciating is it the it's the storm water improvements themselves yes ma'am so we have um like for all of the capital items we have a very detailed listing um you know with each item is depreciated by itself and then it rolls up into one big number what part of that is it check valves or I'm sorry sir that's not a question for me yeah it would be the the curbs the the pipe and the check valves all the components of the system the boxes the inlets okay thank you and is that schedule based on the new improvements or is that are you where where was the schedule created from oh that comes from actual expenses so however much we put into service in any year that gets added to the list and then that total cost gets depreciated over the life of whatever the newest projects yeah theoretically whenever we do the bulk of these projects uh going forward this next year we'll have a large depreciation yes yeah you'll see a substantial increase so tonight we just I'm showing revenue and expenditures we're not showing the balance sheet but those the costs of all the big items that are capitalized are on the balance sheet so you'll see a large amount of infrastructure for the sewer and the equipment and the different properties and things and then yes so we'll depreciate that value over time any other questions or comments so my last slide is what I'd like you to put in your calendars um these are the key dates for you guys I did print out a detailed budget schedule um a budget calendar a lot of that is um external parties deadlines that we've set for ourselves but these are the the meetings that we'd like you to be around for um the budget Workshop is on June 19th July 17th is when you're gonna need to adopt a millage rate and then the September meetings are the important ones you know to have those public hearings so if you have any questions this is the full schedule and the the full schedule talks more about like um like that June 1st deadline the first time the property appraiser sends us the estimated the taxable values and then um you know the the property appraiser certifications those are forms that we fill out and um you know sign online it's an it's an automated process now so I just wanted you to have a full understanding of the whole budget process um and that's it for me tonight if you have any other questions I'll be glad to answer Council going once I I just want to say thanks for coming I think this is the first time you guys have appeared at our meeting since we 've contracted with you all and I really appreciate your time oh thank you I think it's going to be helpful will you attend any of these budget meetings at all um and and the reason I'm asking is because you know I see we've got a 625 000 Surplus and you know what just maybe some guidance and is there a way we can tighten that number a little bit in the in the scheme of things in this budget which is in a very big budget that's a lot of money it is a lot of money um and so what I did want to definitely point out tonight like you like for the general fund especially like you did have a big big year um but we need that money now like um so yes I'll be I'll be as involved as you'd like me to be um Kyle and I meet a lot and we discuss things and get down into the details and then bring it to you okay thank you thank you all thank you Miss guadali I appreciate it all right now we are up to item five this is a presentation from the Pinellas Suncoast fire and rest rescue District uh welcome Chief Jeff Davidson thank you mayor good evening everyone I'm Jeffrey Davidson your fire chief pronounce Suncoast fire rescue I want to give you an update on the fire department how we are trying to improve the Emergency Services on the beaches specifically to Bel Air Beach um there has been response time compliance challenges to this area for a very long time I was identified by the county in 2009 and to date the same problem exists the county has a response time of seven and a half minutes standard it has to be met 90 percent of the time and it's not being met this area is up here have 77 and 87 percent coverage nobody can meet the response times not put around Suncoast not our partners in Clearwater not our partners in Largo why is that well one of the reasons the response times is the geographical coverage that's needed on the beaches right we are at Barrier Island we have multiple Bridges with limited access we have narrow roads with low speed limits we have severe pedestrian vehicle traffic and every year 10 increase in call volume me I think nobody can meet those response times last month in March we have 17 responses to this area 16 emergency they were handled with Nelson Coast Clearwater and Largo and 31 percent of those calls did not meet the response times and that's not acceptable it's not acceptable to me and it should not be acceptable to you another reason for the lacking covers to this area is the fire station on the beaches average about two and a half 2.4 miles apart from each other and you know some Coast station and Clearwater stations 5.6 miles apart and with the call volume and the amount of resources that are needed on calls that's simply too far apart so this year every year around February March there's a process where we put in for our ALS first responder needs for the next fiscal year similar to what you're you're starting to do here and I've asked the county to fund us two additional paramedics firefighters per day as well as an ALS Advanced life support transport capable unit for the beaches and that will improve those response lines we're looking at a piece of property on the Northern end of Indian Rocks Beach where we're planning to build a fire station and more than likely we would move the fire truck there um and that would have three firefighter paramedics on there now this is already paid for it's already paid for by the citizens you already pay into the EMS fund for the county and there's a need for this service and you're just not getting it and I'm fighting for that to improve the services I've been doing this for 35 years I know how this goes and what should be provided and it's not being provided so I submitted a letter to the county asking for the enhancement I've left a copy on the back table there along with some contact numbers uh email addresses of the County Commission because the next step in the process is I'm meeting one-on-one with all the County Commissioners to explain why we need this and they similar to what you do is you decide on what are the priorities for your budget and this is a priority for this budget okay these residents deserve this service they need the service and they pay for this service and they're not getting it from the county so I ask for your support if you could take a copy of my letter read through it my phone number is on there you can contact me with any questions and let our support to the County Commission would really help perhaps some dialogue there and anything any questions that I could answer for you I'm happy to do so Council chief are you still leaving business cards back here yes sir thank you yes sir other questions um Chief uh I don't because you weren't at the last EMS advisory meeting I did speak on your behalf and uh and I believe one of your assistant Chiefs yes sir and uh the response was not exactly what I expected it was more um I you know I I thought that they would be more sympathetic to uh to what you were asking for um and it just seemed like they were trying to put a Band-Aid on on this problem that we have here um so I would advise everyone to please reach out to your County Commissioners and uh and give them a little nudge unfortunately if you're waiting on the EMS advisory uh board to to push it Forward I don't think that's going to happen right and uh uh sometimes just like with Beach nourishment sometimes you kind of have to jump ahead and and jump the chain of command to get things done whenever the uh the the lower levels don't respond uh so uh keep fighting the good fight and uh just to confirm uh what the plan is is even if you get the extra Personnel they will be stationed in Indian Rocks Beach until you are able to um until you're able to to build the new station is that correct sort of so we have that lined up the property is three miles from your city borders and once I know that this funding is going to come through we'll finalize the property acquisition there but I'll put temporary housing the very next day on there so we'll be running that service the minute this gets approved great good deal and and that's going to bridge the gap right now you said it's about six miles yes sir depending on which map you look 5.6 miles uh between well Suncoast any rock station and the Clearwater station 44. um and many times these responses require multiple units there's many times that the beaches are empty you know there's that many emergency calls going on at one time and we don't have that many units on the beaches because each fire station only has one unit in the fire station there's only one fire truck or a specialty unit or a rescue truck and that rescue truck would definitely enhance the response times but also it enhances the service because right now we rely on private Ambulance Company to do the transports and they said at their last meeting they're down 40 paramedics which means we're waiting for them and waiting for them there's times that we're waiting a very long time where with the transport cable unit our own ambulance right staff with two paramedic firefighters in situations like that we would be able to take you to the emergency right away we pull up on scene to a traumatic injury we're not waiting for the ambulance we're going to treat you and get you to the surgeon the emergency room as soon as possible so and and so what they're saying right now is that the way they're accommodating us is they're providing us with I call it volume service anticipated volume service well you can't predict when an emergency is going to happen so posting somebody nearby whenever they think an emergency is going to happen is not that's not an acceptable answer and uh so again I appreciate everything you're doing and I appreciate the monthly reports any any other questions or comments from the council all right thank you very much Chief I appreciate it foreign as you may or may not know uh next May Begins the start of uh sea turtle nesting season and last year we had a presentation from Miss Lindsay Flynn and uh everyone was uh so happy with the presentation and entertained by it that I invited her to come back again I tried to get her at the first of May but she said for some reason she's too busy so uh welcome back Lindsay and uh please let's let's hear your presentation good evening everybody thank you so much for having me this evening again my name is Lindsay Flynn I'm the sea turtle conservation program manager at Clearwater Marine Aquarium just up the road here and I am going to be speaking to you tonight about sea turtle nesting here in Pinellas County um and I'm going to start my presentation by asking you some trivia questions and I hope you'll participate with me so how many species of sea turtles are there in the world throw out a number 30 000. any other guesses take a guess 20. 20. any other guesses 47 47. thank you for your participation there are seven species of sea turtles in the world yeah all right next question how of these seven species how many of them nest in the state of Florida all of them none of them seven seven of them three of them one of them five we get up to five of them which is amazing almost all species of sea turtles Nest here in the state of Florida but three of them are more common so the one to your left here that's the largest species of sea turtle it's called the leatherback the middle one is our important species here it's called the loggerhead sea turtle I'll talk more about that in just a second and the one all the way to your right the right there is called the green sea turtle okay now uh you may or may not know we do have sea turtle nesting even here in the city of Bellaire Beach and the official sea turtle nesting season is May 1st through October 31st we primarily get the loggerhead sea turtle investing here so I'm going to talk about a little bit about their nesting process so that process starts with the adult female emerging from the surf zone at night and she's going to crawl up the beach somewhere between typically uh between the high tide line and the primary Dune trying to select an appropriate Nest site we actually don't know the criteria that they use to select that Nest site we think it might have something to do with temperature maybe the proximity to the Dune line but we still don't know that that's uh more for research purposes okay once she selects that an essay she's going to prepare the nest site by creating something called a body pit it's a shallow depression in the sand and she does that by pushing the surface sand away with her front flippers next she's going to create something called the egg chamber or the Egg cavity and she's going to do that by curling her rear flippers like a shovel and she's going to dig a hole in the sand that kind of looks like an upside down light bulb and what's cool about this part of the process is she does that by feeling she can't look behind her and see how she's doing so she feels how that feels and once she can't bring up any more sand she knows it's time to lay her eggs loggerhead sea turtles will deposit somewhere between 80 and 120 eggs per nest and she will lay anywhere from one to eight nests in a season although it's more typical for her to lay four to five nests in a season every two weeks that is a lot of work for her so she does not layeness every year she typically lays nests every two to four years once she's done with that she's simply going to work backwards so she's going to use her rear flippers to cover the eggs with sand she's then going to camouflage the site in the scent of that Nest by um sort of casting sand about with her front flippers and it um sort of makes a very fluffy mess site once she's done with that she's simply going to turn around and return to the Sea she does not provide any maternal care for her nest she'll come back in about two weeks but only to lay another Nest she's not going to check on her other Nest while she's up there so that Nest is going to incubate for about two months underneath the sand and then those hatchlings are going to emerge together at night and hopefully make their way directly towards the water we're going to talk about why that may not happen um but now that we know that sea turtle nests here in Bellaire Beach why should we care well there's legal reasons to care they are protected under both state and federal law they're protected at the federal level Through The Endangered Species Act and at the state level through the marine turtle protection act there's also ecological reasons so Florida hosts more than 90 percent of all loggerhead nesting activities in North America more importantly oh I should State here that that black line around the State of Florida is where see loggerhead sea turtle nesting occurs so it occurs nearly around the entire Coastline of the state and the only reason it doesn't occur in the Big Bend area is because the Big Bend is Marshland and sea turtles need sandy beaches in order to nest now more interestingly internationally Florida is one of two primary nesting sites for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire world Oman the country of Oman is the other location if you don't remember where Oman is from your geography class it is in the Arabian Peninsula right next to uh Yemen and Saudi Arabia so I think it's really cool that little Florida is a really important nesting site for this sea turtle um but what is sort of scary about that is the country of Oman is seeing decline in loggerhead sea turtle nesting by as much as 79 percent that means arguably Florida is the number one nesting site for the loggerhead sea turtle in the entire planet so that has implications so as the nesting population goes here in the State of Florida so goes the global population of the longer at sea turtle so we have a responsibility to protect our loggerhead sea turtle nest to the best of our ability because it can affect their global population other ecological reasons I think this is kind of timely right now because we're talking about betray nourishment sea turtles help stabilize the beach and I will tell you how so when they lay their nests not all their eggs are going to produce hatchlings some of them just simply aren't fertilized so they're going to end up breaking down eventually and when they do that those eggs are going to release things like nitrogen and phosphorus that can be used by the Dune vegetation to grow and grow their root system and by doing that that then stabilizes the sand and builds up the dunes so stabilizing the beach of course maintains important nesting habitat for sea turtles and Shorebirds and seabirds so they are an important part of the process there we go there's also economic reasons so visit St Pete Clearwater recently released a report that said tourism brings 10.8 billion dollars to the county so we want our tourists to come here to spend their money and sea turtles can help you do that so um there was a marketing analysis done recently and during that market analysis American Travelers were asked um if they were they want to be more proactive in reducing the impact of their travel on the environment and nearly 40 percent of individuals said yes that is important to me so that means that Travelers want to be conscious of what they are doing and the impact they have on the environment why not let them know that they can have an impact on sea turtle nesting and I'll tell you how they can do it in just a little bit also they found that they that Travelers want more authentic less commercial travel experiences so they want to go somewhere they feel good about going to so what is the destination doing to set their destination apart from Tipple typical commercial experiences what's more authentic than a destination caring for its precious Marine Resources like their sea turtles we can fit all of these criteria if we just do more to care about our nesting sea drills finally one of the so they were asked please think deeply about what motivates you to travel what really fuels your desire to travel right now and one of the tier one motivators was creating memories and experiencing new places and what cooler way to create a memory or experience a new area than to know that where you're staying at hosts sea turtle nesting and to be a part of that experience by you know maybe taking a morning walk and seeing a new uh crawl or maybe taking a look at those marked sites and calling to see you know when they have a concern or maybe they see a hatchling sea turtle and they can be a part of that by reporting it they also found that a tier 2 motivator is going somewhere where interesting things happen and learning something and expanding their perspective we have an opportunity to do that with our nesting sea turtles I think nesting sea turtles are pretty interesting and I think your tourists would find the same thing we have an opportunity to teach them something expand their perspective and go and show them what interesting things happen right here so things that we can talk to them about while they're here is reducing their obstructions and reducing light pollution and sea turtle disorientations so one of the things that they don't tend to think about is that leaving their tents and their toys and things on the beach can um negatively impact sea turtles remember they come on the beach at night to lay their nests if they encounter something they're not expecting like that pile of toys you see there going to be adverse to that they're probably going to return to the water without laying a nest that's called a false crawl now it's possible that our sea turtles can come ashore that same night or within a few nights to lay a successful Nest but if they keep coming ashore and keep encountering these items they will eventually turn to the water and they will release those eggs into the water and those eggs are now no longer viable so we've now reduced the potential number of hatchlings we could have produced had those items not been on the beach and there's plenty of instances unfortunately where sea turtles have come ashore you can see their crawl track right near those poles there where she came ashore and simply could not locate a proper place to nest because these items were in the way um sand castles and holes can do the same thing um sometimes they can crawl over it like you see here or sometimes they crawl right on in it and if they experience that they can leave without nesting as well something else that can negatively impact sea turtles is artificial lighting so you can hear see here the nighttime image of the State of Florida you can see areas where there's lots of lighting uh the Miami area Orlando uh Jacksonville and here in Pinellas County interestingly Pinellas County is the most densely populated county for humans in the state of Florida we like we like to use a lot of light at night for safety security and providing a well-lit place for our tours to go but how does that affect our Turtles well under natural conditions both adults and hatchling sea turtles use brightness as a guide to find the water at night so normally I'll Moonlight in Starlight called Celestial light is bouncing off of the water creating a Bright Horizon and that's contrasting with the darkness over the land so they're able to follow that bright light right towards the water now here in Pinellas County we're well developed we have lots of white artificial light on at night which competes with the celestial light sea turtles will go to whatever light is brightest so if that artificial light is brighter they will go towards that and they will find themselves in areas where they should not be poles hot tubs parking lots storm drains in the middle of Gulf Boulevard where they can and they have been run over by cars so the rule of thumb for artificial lighting is if you're standing normally on the beach and you can see the light so too can the turtle so we need to do something about it okay so here's an example of an adult Sea Turtle Crawl track so that crawl track is coming towards you uh way back there is our nesting truck but that is where the nest was laid so she spent a lot of time crawling along the beach uh when she should not have remember we talked about as soon as she's done laying her nest she returns right back towards the water so the fact that she spent all this time crawling along the beach tells us that there was some sort of artificial light source that was impeding her ability to get back towards the water and that's a problem because she only has so much energy to lay these nests so she may not come ashore to lay another Nest later because she just runs out of energy and again that's going to impact our overall population over time um I'm going to warn you that the next couple of photos are graphic and I only show you this because this is a consequence of the prevalence of artificial light here in Pinellas County so remember we talked about that sea turtles could find their way to areas where they should not be and that does include the roadway that includes adults and hatchlings we have had adult sea turtles cross Golf Boulevard after they are done nesting and very nearly get hit by cars this is an instance here where it on this female was struck by a vehicle down south you can see that she was carrying eggs and those will no longer be viable so those have now been removed from population that can happen very prevalently with our hatchlings as well and even if they don't manage to find the roadway they can use precious energy sort of wandering about the beach just trying to find the water they only have so much energy uh to find the water and they need that energy because their goal once they reach the water is to swim to this offshore weed line it's called the sargassum weed line where they rest and feed for their first few years of life so they're wandering the beach they no longer have the energy to get out there so they're very likely to predict be predated by birds and fish along the way um while they're wandering the beach they're also susceptible to predation by Coyotes we've seen them out on the beach coyotes raccoons bird species they can be predated by all of them this is just another example unfortunately if it will load of our hatchlings being run over in the major roadway [Music] this is example of a hatchling disorientation event so if you're having trouble seeing the hatchling tracks I'm going to highlight them for you so you can see this is an instance where a um a nest was uh in the middle of the beach the hatchlings did not go anywhere near the water they instead traveled towards the land where we found them along crawling along the sea wall crawling the in the Dune line wasting precious energy but there's something we can do to help there's something called sea turtle friendly lighting that sea turtles are less uh affected by and our governing agency is called the floor efficient Wildlife Conservation Commission has a motto for that sea turtle friendly lighting it's called keep it long keep it low and keep it shielded and quickly keep it long means use a long wavelength light that's wavelengths above 560 nanometers that's LED light that is emitting light in the orange Amber or Red Spectrum they are less likely to be attracted to that light and they're more likely to be able to orient correctly towards the water next we want to keep it low we want to keep the wattage and the lumens of the Light low for the necessary purpose and we also want to keep it low to the ground so the turtles are less likely to see the light source itself finally we want to keep the light source shielded so they're less likely to see that point source of light it's important to mention here that all three of those guidelines must be met in order to be considered sea turtle friendly like so I want to provide an example of sea turtle friendly light so you really understand what we're asking for so you can see under the before image this is an example of a property up in the panhandle of Florida prior to a retrofit that was completed by the Sea Turtle Conservancy it's another non-profit organization based out of Gainesville Florida and you can see at this property that there's a lot of white artificial light up on the top you can see some ceiling mounted lights a lot of interior white light that allows the property owner to see or about their property but it's also very attractive to our sea turtles so it was very likely that we would find hatchlings on this property after image shows what the property looks like as a sea turtle friendly property so we're certainly not asking people to turn their lights off we understand that Safety and Security and insurance liabilities are an important consideration we are simply asking people to change the type of bulbs and fixtures they are using so this after image is a sea turtle friendly property they are using light in the Amber spectrum and they're using fixtures that are downward directed and they are shielded so even at these properties these sea turtles are less confused by this light they're able to correctly Orient towards the water as they normally would uh but can sea turtles really see a difference I mean that just looks like a different colored light to us right so what's the big deal well I quickly want to do a lighting demonstration with with you and I hope you will participate so I'm going to show you a couple different lights and I want you to look at them with your naked eye and then I want you to look at them with your handy dandy uh light card that I provided to you so first is a white artificial light so don't look directly at the light but use your uh naked eye first so this could be an example of a typical white light that might be installed on somebody's property on the outside so they can see maybe their walkway at night and you can very clearly see that people use that all the time this is an example of a sea turtle friendly light so you can see it's in a shielded fixture and the bulb itself is a LED light that's emitting in the Amber Spectrum I just want you to show that it's on before we do the next part all right now I want you to look at that same light with your sea turtle filter and that will allow you to see what a sea turtle sees okay so look at that light where your special guide can you see the light [Music] yeah you can so sea turtles see that very clearly they're going to be very attracted to that light they're probably going to go towards that light instead of the water let's look like next I want you to look at this light can you see it how about now no you cannot so that is less attractive to them and they are more likely to orient towards the water so it does make a difference the type of lights and fixtures we are using out on our beaches and that goes for city-owned property too things like street lights a public parking lot lights public restroom lights those affect sea turtles just as much as any property foreign other types of artificial lights can affect Turtles as well things like flashlights and cell phone lights everyone's probably seen the flashlight parade on the beach at night with guests or tourists looking for ghost crabs that can affect our hatchling sea turtles in particular so you can find that they will be crawling towards that flashlight or that cell phone light um just like they would any other artificial light source so we ask that people try and to let their eyes adjust to the night and try not to use those cell phone lights and flashlights but if they feel like they need it for safety or security they do sell red LED headlamps at hardware stores and we encourage people to use that light instead um people can report a sea turtle sightings during the nesting season they can use the FWC Wildlife alert hotline anywhere in the State of Florida that will route to the correct organization they they can also call the Clearwater Marine Aquarium we monitor from the city of Clearwater through the city of Treasure Island that's about 21 miles beaches and they can call our rescue hotline at that number that is monitored 24 hours a day um the city of Bellaire Beach also has these lovely signs at all of their public beach accesses that tell our tourists and our residents about the do's and don'ts of sea turtle nesting season and it provides those same phone numbers if they'd like to call in a concern and these signs are also located at our Nest site specifically so they do provide the basic do's and don'ts at that Nest site and to please call those numbers in case they want to report something and again I think it's important to mention here that when we're we're talking about lighting to please consider reviewing your city-owned properties things like Morgan Park your street lights those all can affect uh sea turtle hatchlings and our adults from orienting correctly so I I highly recommend that you review that when we're talking about retrofitting our street lights we're happy to talk to you about what we can do to improve the lighting at city-owned properties um and with that I say thank you very much for listening to me and I'd be happy to take any questions that you have thank you Miss Flynn uh I'll tell you what let's go to the citizens does anyone have any questions for Miss Flynn any others Council yes Mike Sable yeah um that's an email specifically about Golf Boulevard I mean that's really that the lights aren't owned by us I mean what should we do I mean we can't just say hey replace all the bulbs you can there's an ability to do that now uh Duke Energy has a wonderful suture lighting specialist his name's Michael Smith he's specifically working in this area to help retrofit street lights so yes it's true that you don't own the light you probably lease them from duke they have the ability to retrofit all of those street lights with sea turtle friendly bulbs and shields my question would be are they providing the funding as well no however I believe they he did mention that he is talking about potentially doing some sort of and this I may be misspeaking here so please bear that in mind but he was talking about some sort of payment system too so Duke has been really good about working with municipalities about this they want to help with this sort of situation so they may be able to help in some sort of payment plan if you okay just be asked if the maybe city manager just gets in contact as long as we have a you know there's a there's a number out there so we understand kind of impact if we were to go along that route absolutely I'd be happy to do that other questions yes Mr bankert um or the blue lighting that's being replaced like on the is that sea turtle friendly blue lighting is not sea turtle friendly in fact it's one of the colored lights besides white lights that is most attractive to turtles so uh blue light green light purple light very attractive to our turtles so they are going to be drawn towards that instead of crawling away because I had some residents ask me what is the blue lighting and I said I have no idea they thought it might be for you know mammals or sea turtles or whatever no that's a that's a problem actually in the lamp and Duke's been replacing those as they find them it's just a it's a technical issue as well the the other thing is um our beaches are getting battered year after year and I see especially from first to 19th Street there's very little beach left so you guys come out you put up a nice little barricade a mild storm comes takes that barricade right out uh what happens to that Nest that's a great question so what happens when our barricades are lost we have a couple of methods that we use um to refine The Nest so we're very fortunate that a bank gave us a grant to purchase a special GPS units they're called Trimble TDC 150s they're sub meter GPS's so instead of knowing our GPS location of our Nest down to 10 feet we can now know them four to six inches um so if we were to lose all of those Nest markers we can use those GPS units now to just like a compass to refine our Nest so we're very thankful for those funds but we also Place secondary markers in the back beach to use as a backup as well so those nests aren't washed out uh no well sometimes yes sometimes no so Nest can take some wash over so long as that water is drained out fairly quickly you can think about it like if we were in a pool so we have to be able to surface to breathe every now and again in order to be okay but if we go sit under the water for too long we run out of air eventually it's very similar with our our eggs they have they exchange gases with the environment down in the bottom and if they sit under the water too long they can no longer do that I just want another thing um has clear water marine turtle protection act or whatever got involved with trying to get Beach reimbursement since we have no beach they're not going to be coming here say that one more time for me it has the Clearwater Marine or in the sea turtle protection uh Society in this sea turtle Conservatory or they involved trying to get Beach renourishment because I don't know if they reached out to the FED because we're not going to get anything for at least two more years that's a great question we do our best to make sure that um our federal agencies are well educated on how our sea turtles use the environment as well as our nesting sea our seabirds and Shorebirds because our sea turtles are not the only marine animal that are usually utilizing our beaches to Nest so I think it's very important that we do do our due diligence to educate our our stakeholders about how the beach is utilized thank you I have a question uh have you had any interactions with the Army Corps of Engineers yes yes and uh and and how did that go um well our main interaction comes from um working with them during the 2018 renourishment project so we worked we had Communications with them during that project and um what is their take and yours on uh the value of uh nourishment or the sea turtle population good question so sea turtles need sandy beaches ultimately to Nest successfully um I think our Pinellas County Environmental Management would agree that typically our beaches are erosional beaches so we can expect that our beaches will lose sand over time um now how full disclosure sea turtle nesting can be negatively impacted in the short term with Beach renourishment because typically here in Pinellas County we're nourishment projects happen during the sea turtle nesting season so it's sometime between May and October and that typically happens because um other areas like the east coast of Florida for example gets much higher nesting density than we do here we can expect two to three hundred nests in our area in the season they can expect tens of thousands of nests in their area so typically they are given priority for renourishment projects in the off season of sea term nesting season so we are then asked to do those projects during season that negatively impacts our nests because we are required to relocate them so we don't want a bunch of sand dumped onto the sea turtle nest because they would not the hatchlings would not be able to crawl out successfully so we have to when they're laid we have to dig them up and transfer them to an area that will not receive sand anytime you do that you can affect the hatching and emerging success of those eggs which can affect the number of hatchlings that you're going to produce so um while we do we certainly do our utmost to make sure that those nests are well protected it can impact them however for nourishment projects typically offer wider beaches for our sea turtles to Nest so there are negatives and positives to that project okay thank you very much any other questions so I've got a couple quick ones yes so the um I'm assuming then so the actual nesting always takes place at night typically some species can lay their nests during the day that's the critically endangered temps Ridley sea turtle and we have gotten a chemist Ridley nests in our survey area we we got them to your north um but we do get those very rare nesting species here and they nest during the day but majority at night how about the hatching hatching happens at night you get the very rare mixed signals that the hatchlings think it's nighttime and it is not and you get a day hatch out but 99 of it is at night when you guys ran across those particular uh hatchings that were disoriented so what do you guys do at that point do you pick them up and take them to the water certainly it depends on the condition and the hatchling and what's going on so we do have a 24-hour hotline that uh we ask the public to call we will respond to those calls 24 hours a day we assess the situation try and locate those hatchlings and we will either release them with approval from our veterinarian or we will bring them to the aquarium for veterinarian evaluation um sometimes they look very tired and very weak sometimes they might have some sort of injury maybe from a predator or something like that so they need to be seen okay so the best thing for us to do if we were to see that is not pick them up and take them to the water call you guys correct absolutely thank you something you didn't discuss is when they hit the water it's no guarantee they're going to survive they are food to the fish out there so just uh I mean talk talk about that a little bit so we can expect among the hatchlings that reach the water that 1 in 1 000 hatchlings Will Survive so it's point one percent um so they can be predated we truly don't know the extent to what happens to them out in the water it's hard for us to research that but um they can be predated by um fish and bird species sometimes they're too weak from you know being disoriented on the beach if they just so happen to make it to the water um they may no longer have the energy reserves to make it out there so it's critically important that we make sure we do our best to protect all of the hatchlings and try and get them to the water because only 0.1 percent of them will survive into adulthood all right thank you Miss Flynn we're running a little short on time but uh I greatly appreciate you coming uh very educational enlightening uh conversation about sea turtles uh you are welcome to come back next year and uh and do this presentation again I will be here thank you very much [Music] all right we are on to item seven which is the quarterly board reports uh let's begin with the board of adjustments report from Mr Mike Kelly good evening Mr Mayor and council members I'm Mike Kelly board chairman um since we're talking about the quarter January February and March the board of adjustments started off with a bang having a variance meeting in January for an issue on 22nd Street on new houses under construction in March we were supposed to have another hearing on an appeal of administration appealed by our city manager it was deemed to be postponed by our City attorney for further work with the with the resident so March was canceled but coming up in April next week we have a variance um for a pool and in Mar and in may we also have another variance for pool on the same issue that I harp on all the time about crown of the road so that's to be discussed whenever the council so deems it so we're moving along having a good quarter any questions thank you very much Mr Kelly thank you all right next up is the citizens advisory committee Mr Ron saganic thank you mayor council uh this is advisory committee uh met two times this quarter February 22nd we met to review and recommend financing options to accelerate multi-year Capital Improvements for the city related to Street resurfacing and storm water projects which will be presented later this evening in the agenda secondly we met as the audit committee on March 22nd uh that was to review the uh annual comprehensive financial report that was prepared by the city Auditors at salt marsh the committee recommended delaying that approval until the uh uh full reports and with financial statistics are added to the uh to the audit Council any questions no thank you we'll see you shortly all right next up is uh the Park and Recreation report uh Tammy lavenda good evening everybody um quick update for park and rec board January through March we welcome two new members which we're happy to have um we had three successful Beach cleanups we welcome everyone that comes every month we're thankful for them and to everyone that comes on a regular basis and to our guests always happy to have people there um January we had our second annual health and wellness Fair which went very well we had some tried and true returning from the first one that we had and we had some new people out which was great we've already started booking people for 2024 if anybody has a connection with the mole patrol please call me because I'm really trying to get them here for next year um a new program that we started um this quarter was the new Resident welcome bags because um it became apparent when everyone was trying to get off the island that there were people that didn't know that they needed a hurricane pass to get off or you know they moved here and there's so many things that you're doing to try to move so we put together like a nice little welcome bag and then it has all the pertinent information that they need for City information and then um Aaron made door hangers and then we hang them on the door for them to come to the city hall and pick them up so something new that we started um we are right in the middle of a park survey for this quarter so our board goes out we look we spend significant time in every single looking for the good the bad safety issues and then we do a recap with the city manager and we um we work on that list diligently throughout the quarter uh Bellaire Beach merchandise um we have the things we have right now we're looking for something new if anyone has any suggestions or if they're looking for something or I think I might have mentioned it before but we're looking into like the yeti like cups with the Bellar Beach logo on them I think for something new and then fall events we have our third annual Halloween on October 28th we have our holiday social on December 4th we have our second annual mayor's chili cook-off on December 10th which is a Sunday this year and then we'll have our third annual health and wellness Fair on January 13th so is there any questions Council oh yeah oh yes what was what was the company you referenced the mole what it's um it's through Marstons the mole Patrol so it's like a traveling like dermatologist so they check like moles and skin mole the mole Patrol I thought you found out moles in the ground or something yeah and I thought it was a cool band it probably is somewhere but I did too thank you would any dermatologist worker that you want the mobile yeah no any dermatologist would work we've had a hard time getting a dermatologist here but they're kind of like they have a trail kind of like the blood donator mobile there they would be in the parking lot and then you could actually go in and get a checkup as opposed to just talking to a dermatologist in the building but yeah we would love any dermatologist so thank you thank you uh now we're up to the Planning and Zoning report uh do we have a Planning and Zoning report tonight oh all right moving right on to item number eight this is the City attorney report Mr Moore you have the floor uh thank you Mr Mayor always a pleasure since our last meeting uh our office has been tracking legislative session very closely as recently as last week I made a presentation before the Big C concerning one bill of particular interest to many Beach communities though with less impact here which is Senate Bill 714 in its house corollary House Bill 833 concerning short-term rental regulations um The Cliff Notes version of it is you folks have grandfathered protected Provisions prohibiting short-term rentals in certain zoning districts not every Beach Community and not every community in Florida is so fortunate and the landscape for those outside of that protective bubble is ever changing and often unsatisfying um and at present there's a bill proposed that would change that landscape further it's being sponsored by in the Senate by senator sigley from locally the bill seems to presently be stalled in its committee hearings but has um session is still only halfway through so it may gain traction we we continue to monitor those um one that affects you folks particularly is um House Bill 37 and and cscs Senate Bill 774 which concerns Financial disclosure forms for elected officials at the local level until now um and perhaps Ms Livingstone may be the only one who's unfamiliar with this to this point um you've filled out form One Financial disclosures there are different forms for the financial disclosures and the current legislation which is um gained a lot of traction I believe it has already moved through one of the two Chambers um and is likely to move through the other would have you fill out a form six uh form six gets much more granular in its attention to your finances um including Assets in excess of a thousand dollars liabilities your interest Holdings and businesses and the like um so that is um understanding the The Narrative behind it is increased transparency of interest in local government um of the the counter narrative that's been offered to is the chilling effect it may have on on those willing to go into public service knowing how open their Affairs may be another one another set of bills that we're tracking closely is uh the what was Senate Bill 1372 and House Bill 1321 it's not moving in the house so this is at least what I consider to be good news but it was a bill that would render local elections um open to partisan advertisement and partisan elections um in the event you felt local elections weren't contentious enough um it was a potential to add another layer to that that seems to be stalling but again things can move in session rather quickly or become Riders on other bills so we will keep tracking that the other bill that we're looking at very closely is Senate Bill 170 um and it's House Bill 1515 to me this is of the greatest consequence to the business we do here together um Senate Bill 170 and it's uh which has already passed the senate in House Bill 1515 which is headed to the floor of the house uh would require any adopted ordinance to have a business impact statement um it does not State what expertise or or detail would be required to give some values or factors how those will be determined in substantiated remain to be seen of added concern to that is not just hey there's one more step to getting ordinances adopted but most tellingly up until now there's been a statutory element on the books concerning ordinances that are preempted and when somebody challenges an ordinance and says hey it's been preempted that was a an addition in the last three years and if you sustain if you kept an ordinance on the book after being told it was preempted and were challenged you faced exposure to attorney's fees as a community for the plaintiff's attorney's fees that language has been enhanced to say if it's arbitrary um or or what was the other word frivolous I believe was the word arbitrary frivolous or preempted uh and a and in some litigant brings suit against the city to challenge its ordinance you face exposure to fees and not only that but while during the pendency of that suit you have to stay the enforcement of the ordinance um so if somebody said if you pass something tomorrow somebody challenges it you cannot enforce it while that challenge is being resolved by the courts I imagine the courts will have to give these priority however our courts are already taxed in the tort reform if you've not seen the news coverage on that wallet while in depending on where you sit on that has been seen as a positive it has resulted in a massive influx of litigation to local dockets at least in the short term um the courts are trying to figure out how to handle that because and this is a separate bill but the torque reform that went through changed the period for negligence suits for four years to two years so plaintiff's attorneys who are sitting on things watching this legislative session suddenly said well I've got like two 2 000 cases in the backlog I'm just going to get them all filed right now and so there's been an influx of litigation and we've seen that with some of our city as well cities that haven't seen suit in a decade have two or three pending but getting back to the Senate Bill 170 and House Bill 1515 the business impact and mandatory stay elements are peculiar in may serve to further uh the home rule elements of what you do here especially as a smaller Community having to forecast business impact statements and who knows how those findings end up being leveraged later either for against you so that is to say again we continue to track this as I have substantive updates I will continue to provide them either in writing or otherwise to make sure you have timely updates on session um the the most notable news though not necessarily specific to municipalities though of course with impact on our deputies and otherwise was the concealed carry changes which go to and go into effect in July where you do not need a concealed carry permit to carry a firearm in the State of Florida going forward and I don't say that without any editorialization just pay it passed be aware um and so outside of that we um because I I have a feeling if I don't say anything I will get asked at the last meeting there was some lengthy exchange concerning the the uh property with the antenna structure his attorney is presently on vacation this week and expecting to get us a statement on or before April 14th um of of with a substantive submission again the antenna tower is not being erected during that time so that's a little leniency in some of the urgency there if you will but it does not mean that it is not being addressed or resolved that is the current status of that I did communicate to the extent my memorandum at our last meeting had um some some fields of inquiry I communicated those and more to his attorney and he's since been in touch with Kyle they are exchanging emails and have exchanged emails it's not radio silence um but that that matter continues to to move forward otherwise I'm happy to answer any questions you may have thank you Mr Moore uh any uh questions or comments uh actually this is more admin can somebody unplug that life before it burns through the cord please thank you actually I was I was going to uh suggest just a brief pause in the meeting so uh if you if you needed to remove your equipment Miss Flynn you're more than welcome too I'm not going to make you wait through the whole meeting if you have something to do I thought she was just riveted by the presentation but fine man I believe member bankert had a question or concern Mr Baker um to follow up on the tower are you saying he applied for a permit or he still hasn't applied he has not his his complete permit submission is forthcoming one of the one of the delays if you will or on top of his just personal leave was one of the questions that we asked very specifically um that goes to this inquiry is not only what is the capacity in terms of height um and and signal for this antenna structure but what is his actual need um if he only needs to for example you know the now the analogy I gave um in speaking with some of you is you know when I was in Middle School I had a basketball hoop I did it could have gone to 10 feet I didn't need it to go higher than seven for what I was doing right and so similarly he may not need to get the full capacity and there's a study that he needs to do I can't remember the term uh cropping study or something forget the term of Art thank you propagation study that needed that needed to be done and so that allowing some time for that based on the inquiries that we post thank you any other questions or comments for the City attorney I have a question regarding uh that house bill 37 did you say it looked like it was going to pass or yes House Bill 37 and let me let me just pull up I have all these in here that's the financial disclosure one you only just I have several tabs here I want to make sure that I'm I'm speaking to the right one so the Senate bill is um 774. it uh that bill has um gone through at least two of its committees and it's heading to its um it's gone through ethics and elections and it's gone through the rules committee uh 16 to four votes pending reference review so it's going to that senate floor um is for the Senate version and then it's uh the related bill of House Bill 37 uh House Bill 37 has favorable by all of by it's in its last committee I believe state affairs committee um and so likely to um at least see its way to the house floor whether it passes I can't say but the other element to all of this is good bad or indifferent you have a party that has a super majority in the legislature and the same party is in power in the governor's seat which is to say if they if leadership wants something done it's almost certainly getting done there's not going to be a lot of surprises with split votes or hey that was a you know came close but one person came across the aisle if leadership wants something done it's likely going to be done by the rate that this has moved through the Committees and the discussion that's been happening on these they've generally been passing along party lines and it is it is moving and there's still roughly a month left in session so very likely to get to the House and Senate floor and if the if the votes thus far are in committee or any indication likely to pass not a certainty again I I don't I'm no suits there but um I just I hope that the voters pay attention and speak to our Representatives because in our small town you'll get no one running for office with this type of financial scrutiny and I think that's that's the goal I really do I think that that is the goal is to drive out uh these small municipalities um I've I've had several conversations with people around the county and uh just like the uh the the lawsuit the maximum penalty uh that they could be awarded in a lawsuit they're talking about what is it right now 200 000 and they're talking about there's only 200 000 in a 2.5 million that has been proposed that one has not moved quite as much the sovereign immunity cap extension but yes that is on the table and that that's a that's a uh a store closer for us that would be it has the potential to be in any number of these things and you know I I know mayor Gaddis was present for my presentation at The Big C and at the risk of you know getting too much within a on a soapbox or a platform I'd just say um the current trajectory of our of this legislative session and the more recent ones presents at least if not an existential threat certainly an existential concern for smaller communities and you've you see that in the public comment we're seeing not just here but in other communities of people lamenting the loss of their neighborhoods and and just having streets whether that's short-term rentals home-based businesses property rights protections and everybody's saying but what about my property rights they always seem to be in in competition and you're starting to lose the ability to to cultivate and sustain the unique character of each of these small communities that we've developed that has made this community and communities like it across Florida so attractive and so you know I I to the extent I I can make a statement to the to the to you as a council and to your public is recognizing that your remedy isn't always here we've been taught in Civics that the government that governs local governments best or you know governs closest government's best and that's your local government so much of that is being recaptured if you will by Tallahassee and the remedies that people come to you and say why don't you guys fix this and then you know you folks run and then you meet some poor sap like me who tells you yeah all the things you wanted to do you can't do um because Tallahassee says so when they get to say so and I'm not suggesting otherwise in our system of government they have the ability to take those things back and they um whereas that was done as the exception it seems to be the rule it's beginning to make the uh the State of Florida lose its luster is what it's doing and they're taking our character away and uh Unfortunately they don't listen to us they don't listen to elected officials on the municipal level I think that the only only people they will ever listen to are the voters oh sorry uh for the negative uh comments there yeah just briefly this Moore I would you like to address briefly the situation the letters and the emails that we received this week about the uh signs and the uh I guess protesters uh because that's been added as an agenda item I'll withhold until we get to that agenda item but thank you any other questions I guess um last year when the um the inspection requirement was passed for the condos three stories and up there was talk that it might be re readdressed this year is there anything that looked like that's happening excellent question thank you um I I don't remember and and have not written it down the the bill number and I can follow up with you on that it is being Revisited which is one of the reasons why um to the extent local jurisdictions we're trying to advise or or be advised about the issue there's everybody's kind of being told hold on let wait and let's see because some of while the ostensibly it was with that the the bill or statute um that member nataro is referencing was the bill done post-surf side on mandatory inspections of condos over x height or floors and and the entire regime around that every 20 years 10 years if it's this and all that stuff that came out some of the it was it was well intentioned and as with many as with much legislation that's done in a reactive and accelerated Pace um people after the fact realize like hey it says this but it doesn't really put that onus on anybody um whose responsibility is it to do this and it says a municipality must but then there's no timeline there's no how do I know what to do and so yes there is some legislation being um proposed and discussed this session no I don't have a specific recollection of its terms so I'll make sure to get that update to you after the meeting thank you any other questions or comments for the City attorney all right thank you very much Mr Mora now we're up to item number nine city manager report Mr riefler thank you mayor um so I'm going to start off with the uh Gulf Boulevard undergrounding uh we just had a progress meeting on March 29th uh unfortunately we're still kind of waiting on the materials to get here uh Duke Energy has you know contracted those materials they just you have not have a confirmation on the date but the underground and contractor is very confident that enthusiasm materials is going to get started on this so when I have a date of the actual progress uh breaking ground uh the the project breaking ground I will make it known so you guys are aware the uh golf ball of our buoy replacement um for the new Zone that we created with the ordinance those are now installed we installed the 16 and newly labeled buoys we had to bring them in uh based on the beach erosion to get that 300 foot distance so the line is actually a little closer than it was the previous buoys the city staff is planning to remove the the remaining old Idol wake buoys in the meantime those are actually outside of our new created swim zone so they're not actually causing confusion within that zone uh the stormwater Improvement project as we have on the agenda tonight we have a banknote resolution the city hall generator I told you I would get uh some side-by-side quotes of the uh portable unit we discussed and the original unit which was on the generator stand um I did see both of them come in on my email today um one of them during this meeting so um they're the prices are holding pretty much where they were again it's a 15-day price period that they're giving I wanted to follow up with one of the vendors on some of the specific questions we had concerning the fuel tank and some of the warranty but I will get that uh emailed out to you this week uh children's play program replacement that only got bumped back to April 21st so I'm very hopeful um that it's going to be coming for this month I started working on the Personnel policy we currently have a personal policies and procedure manual as well as an employee handbook uh what I've noticed over the years working here is there is a lot of the same material covered in both documents um one document we'll have more detail in one section the other one will have more detail in another section and there is some areas that it isn't congruent so what I'm having done by the currents group is to update and combine those documents so that we have a more uh ready resource to to look up personal matters and make sure that we're where we need to be as far as uh how employment laws changed after they have combined the documents that we'll have it reviewed by the City attorney the I'm working on a grant policy which would be an administrative policy which will outline uh when we have a project come before us and we're looking at funding how we approach it and a formal process of how we look for other funding methods um you know before we we lean into our budget so and also cover some of the ongoing grants that we have throughout the year that that we all we plan on getting every year and uh and how we go about that I'm hoping to have that it'll be a future work session for the next work session uh I wanted to start presenting an example of what I see this this score card uh initiative to be um to summarize where we're at and in our projects the Strategic plan um how our finance ties into it and it also had a code enforcement element so um that I will be presenting to you at the next work session to get some feedback and I just wanted to follow up on the icma fccma development um I actually miss I misquoted the dates in this report uh the April 13th our 11th to 13th I will be at the floodplain conference I will be going to the uh the Florida County Commission uh City Managers Association conference on May 30th through June 2nd and um I've been in touch with the icma the uh they there is a level of a of experienced credits you have to reach they told me that they would provide a report based on where I am at uh so I have a realistic timeline and also I'm waiting for the leadership development program that they offer to be reimagined um they've told me it was supposed to be this year early January um than I've last told me in April that they'll have that program you know where where you can start to register for it what that will do is it'll provide education for me and also at the same time uh reduce the amount of years of experience that I will need it'll count towards experience credit for to getting towards credentialing um it was mentioned the traffic study and the systems comments I've been in touch with Pinellas County Tom Washburn and some of his employees and engineers and they we did a a doodle poll to find a meeting date to meet on site at the intersection the lab the the dates I selected because I have the conference was uh April 18th and April 19th um I did ask uh if council member robbers could attend that meeting since he was involved and had the meeting with Tom before that so I will follow up on that um Park Mobile uh we have everything turned in necessary to get started they have a proof for the signs that we're going to install um the last thing I just I saw the email coming I was getting a bank letter for the ACH depositing so once I send that to them they told me the timeline would be about a three three week timeline to make that conversion and that's that's all I got Council Mike Sable when we um selected your city manager we also took on the responsibility to make sure that you're being mentored uh giving you advice suggestions Etc I mean we talk daily but I just wanted to point out you found a problem here with a Personnel policy you basically were extremely proactive you found a need matched the parties that would contribute most to this effort and I just wanted to point it out that that's a really it's an outstanding effort it shows insight and uh basically at a level well above you so I just wanted to compliment you on that and I hope that you're collecting these city manager reports because we'll talk later about evaluations and these really are a key part of your evaluations and just a brief timeline what I've seen in your performance so far has been thoroughly outstanding professional at a range well above your age um very well done just wanted to publicly acknowledge your efforts and the outstanding efforts on behalf of the city thank you thank you any other questions or comments for the city manager following up with Mr Sables I've heard nothing but good things from the residents about you too um I agree your evaluations uh we'll be looking at but um since you're doing such a fine job I don't think we should be holding you to that two-year wage freeze I hope this Council gives you a raise this year any other questions or comments Mr Roberts yeah thank you Kyle so you had mentioned that you had contacted Tom Washburn which is wonderful and so he came back to say he was good with the 18th and 19th that we're still waiting I'm going to follow up on that because I filled out the survey immediately um but I haven't heard so I'm gonna give them a call okay I know that would be great and one other quick question has the city um finalize who we're going to use as the engineering firm for the storm water Improvement projects no we're not there yet um I'm planning on getting uh design proposals from all six firms because I want to really look at them okay great thank you uh Mr reefer uh we had a brief conversation a few days ago concerning the um the fines and metering and what we were subjecting to the public parking lots um are you in a position where you can discuss that um so we did have a meeting and [Music] um all all said and done the Army Corps is going to uh be able to provide some uh administrative guidance um for further uh uh contracts and agreements for Beach renourishment um having presented uh where we stood as a city and what you know what we were doing with our rates and all that they did not uh upfront see any uh major issues um and they were able to uh justify what we were doing because it was in violating the policies that they uh feel are necessary to keep it open to the public so um the meeting went well um and I'm looking forward to the the guidance that they provide because it's going to clear up some confusion among all the the municipalities that are involved with the nourishment program I find it interesting that they only want to discuss Beach nourishment whenever we're trying to increase the fines and parking rates interesting all right any other questions or comments for the city manager no thank you very much Mr riefler all right now we are on to item number 10 which is the city clerk report um I just wanted to do a follow-up on the uh quarterly reports the audit committee and the Planning and Zoning Board that we will be getting meetings with them so that we can get those two things to city council so that's we'll be setting up those meetings and the City attorney is going to be doing the government in the sunshine um presentation on Wednesday at 5 30 for all the boards and committees but the public is welcome too and that's all I have any questions or comments for the city clerk yes Mr Roberts so Patty is that Sunshine presentation is that required yearly by everybody or is that a once in a lifetime that it is required annually uh for for our elected members um and I believe extends to the boards now as well um but regard I'm not sure about that but definitely to our elected members um this training that we're doing on Wednesday is knocked towards that credit because this is sort of a cliff notes version um the four-hour course that you took at email last or in in years past or um is offered online through the FLC or through various other vehicles is always available but you do have to complete that annually for you folks this one is intended more to make sure that top to bottom our teams know about their obligations duties responsibilities as public or semi-public officials as it relates to public records Sunshine Law in my tenure here I've not had the opportunity to meet with all those boards and we've already in this one year had new members come on and you know hopefully establishing a pattern of as we get new members always bringing them through a sort of a brief thank you any more questions or comments for the city clerk one last one was one is the form one do for us we're talking about the financial forms the form one what does that do for us sorry one is the form one due for us September I think isn't it my recollection is that they begin to to distribute those in the summer months okay um mine is typically submitted um by early July and I only know that because I always send it as the last thing I do before I go on my fourth of July oh so do this so you usually see that in June they did change the policy and and with all uh respect Patty if I step on your toes in the last two years they did change the policy administratively that they tend to send your specific form to your city registered email account when I say they I mean the commission on ethics and state agency not they Patty and Kyle um and so um you you should be on the lookout for that as we get into June uh for that form and if you haven't submitted it by a certain day Patty or somebody from the city usually starts saying hey guys this is coming up get it in you know before July so you don't have late fees or start getting nasty grams about you know why aren't you why haven't we received your form yet um all right any other questions or comments for Patty nope all right so uh now we're moving on to the consent agenda this is items 11 through 15. this is for approval of the February 23rd 2023 city council work session minutes approval of March 6 2023 city council

removed for the approval of the consent agenda all right motion made by Mike Sable second by uh Frank bankert all in favor aye aye any opposed all right the consent agenda passes now we are on to the regular agenda item number 16. this is for consideration of resolution 2023.02 Mr Mora yes one moment Mr Mayor sorry Mr Mayor I'm getting that page of the materials Okay resolution 2023-02 a resolution of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida authorizing the issuance of the city's Capital Improvement Revenue note series 2023 in the principal amount of 2 million one hundred twenty thousand dollars it improved um to finance acquisition and construction of Capital Improvements including Street resurfacing and storm water facilities providing that the note shall be a limited obligation of the city payable from non-advalent revenues budgeted appropriated and deposited as provided herein providing for the right Securities and remedies for the owner of the node authorizing certain officials and employees of the city to take all actions required in connection with the sale issuance and delivery of such note making such determinations as are required to afford the no Bank qualified status making certain governance and agreements in connection with there with and providing for an effective date this has been a reading of resolution 2023-02 by title only Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mora before we go to Citizen comments would the city manager like to summarize what he just read so sorry so this is a resolution for a banknote um and we uh in the last work session presented uh the the five stormwater uh phases or projects um that were part of our uh Master Plan update of 2017 um via citizens advisory committee uh did a lot of work and um Heather who's here tonight um Lots again contributing into the projections of where the city was at financially and um you know there's been uh there's been a want from residents to uh want to move these projects along because it's a very important Initiative for the city so the assistance Advisory Group took that on and uh and found a way that we uh we can healthily Finance uh all these projects and you know get them taken care of and uh uh you know move forward and at the same time with it with a plan to pay back this loan in an accelerated pace so thank you let's go to the citizens for uh comments on this particular agenda item would anyone like to speak foreign yes good evening everyone my name is Kim Shaw Elliott I live at 121 9th Street very pleased to be with you tonight I'm here to very strongly support the proposal I want to commend uh the city manager and the committee that did this work that they were able to deal with a very complex issue and deal with confidence to be able to present to you a proposal that is critical it what's more important or fundamental to a city purpose than to be able to provide Safe Streets and things that so things don't flood away which is kind of critical here it's timely we are facing many environmental issues right now and it's time that we act now and it's creative because it's been brought a resolution to many issues that we have to deal with and it's doing it in a way that will actually bring some positive numbers at the end of it I won't spend a lot of time talking about what the benefits of this proposal are but um in in quick summary what these proceeds will do is will give the city the opportunity to have better pricing so bidding one big job versus a bunch of smaller jobs is Chloe an advantage you'll have more attention for more qualified providers and you'll be able to get the better pricing with that big bigger job you'll be able to provide for supplies needed to do this in bulk rather than again a bunch of series a series of smaller jobs and it'll be able to accelerate completion of these critical repairs for just two years to finish all of our state streets get it over with we don't know when the next big event will occur um I think it's it's it's frightening in terms of what is impending and uh having our streets taken care of now is really really important and in the end of the day is going to give additional savings to the city in that we've had the opportunity to take advantage of some very favorable interest rates uh for the funds that will be sitting there so there are two things that I'd like to address about this proposal one is to make certain certain that it does adequately address the problem when we plan we need to plan for the future we're not going to recreate what has been done in the past or do what we think is needed now because we know the future will be different than what it is now and I would like to make sure that we take the opportunity to adequately address the needs of these flood control measures my understanding is that the proposal as it sits right now does not have any arrangement for any kind of retaining pool or or any kind of tanks that will hold excess water when it comes and if that's needed we need to address that now and not rebuild in a way that will already be proven inadequate so I would like to ask that we take the moment to at least read reassess and confirm what the needs for this project are and that they're taken care of now um the other thing is that I would ask that you prioritize 9th Street so 9th Street somehow was skipped over in the uh in the work that has been done to date 9th Street is the entryway to our beautiful Park here it's the parts it includes City parking it includes uh the back entrance to this lovely facility um Ninth Street regularly floods uh 9th Street I know has had uh property sales even rescinded because of the flooding that occurred right in the middle of a of a proposed sale so this is an important issue it's an important Street and I'd like to ask that you consider Ninth Street in this proposal thank you Michelle thank you would any other citizens like to comment on this topic hello my name is Fritz will 905 Harbor Drive and I can just say the same thing that Kim just said it's really necessary I try for two years to find an answer of why 9th Street was skipped in the first place and then what are what happened to eighths and seventh streets what are what have you found out is it still flooding um and I still don't know what you are really going to do to prevent the flooding um that those are questions that are still open otherwise I think we all agree that we have to do something especially in Ninth Street I live at the end of Ninth Street and every time there is a flood and people are trying to collect the bags the setbacks you know all all the trucks coming down the road they flap my front yard that is not acceptable so I thank you for listening Mr will any other uh questions or comments from the citizens yes John hansick 22nd Street I happen to sit on a Citizens advisory committee and I speak very highly of this uh proposal one of the things that we also took into consideration when we contract to do two streets at a time you have the logistics of bringing in the equipment and then removing it it costs money that's factored in if we one of the things we looked at to do this successively was that would save a significant amount of money I think it was somewhere around 250 350 000 dollars just in moving equipment in and out of the city if we did it the way we're doing it now as to the issue of flooding it's like some other folks have said before we're not going to solve it it's not going to go away we live on a Barrier Island the one thing that is a plus is the fact that these drains that go out into the Intracoastal have the check valves [Music] so when you have a high tide it closes the valve and prevents the water from backing up and flooding it's just one of those things we're not ever going to solve the problem completely 100 percent of flooding it's not going to happen but this will take care of it in the long term thank you thank you Mr hansik any more comments or questions from the citizens nope all right citizens comments are closed uh before we continue I'm going to need a motion to approve this resolution motion motion made by Frank Baker do I have a second second I believe whatever I believe that one her hand went up anyway all right Mr Banker do you have the floor thank you I'm supporting this uh funding although replacing 70 year old pipes that really never worked you're going to produce the same effects you're going to get the same effects unless we do this right so you need to catch Basin you need pumps a lot of them homes in Harbor Drive when those pipes were put in we're not there that means the elevation of that discharge pipe really needs to be raised up because those check valves that we talk about they're nothing more than sunny day check valves when a high tide comes up on a sunny day the water does not come in the street when you're getting three inches of rain an hour or more that check valve closes it will not open until that tide comes down I live on 8th Street the discharge pipe was put in way before that house those houses were built we never elevated that pipe that means we have to wait about an hour and a half to two hours when high tide comes down for that valve to open up so we're actually accumulating more and more water because that water will not leave the street and where does that order go in your yards hopefully not your homes so yes we need to solve the problem but we don't need to solve a problem that was occur that we created we didn't create 70 years ago we need to do it smart we need to spend the money smartly we also need like the man said mobilization of equipment working in this field it'll cost you anywhere from 50 to 100 000 in moving equipment so you need to coordinate one street to be done in another Street to start right away if that equipment is moved out the permitting cost the stowing the removal will cost us anywhere from fifty thousand to a hundred thousand dollars per Street or per project so when one Street's done we need to attack that next street we're going to have to find a contractor and award the same contractor to do all these projects because we have contractor a and then we have to bring in contractor B we're already in the hole for mobilization that's all I have to say thank you Mr Banker other comments oh all right well let's uh let's take this to a roll call vote this is to approve resolution 2023-02 Miss Gentry would you please call the roll I'm sorry I make one comment I've heard that the equipment that we're proposing to put it at the end of Ninth Street I'm sorry ma'am I already I'm send us some comments oh I apologize I'll come back uh you know what we're about to uh we're about to vote on this uh Council would you like to entertain her thoughts okay please I apologize uh Cheryl gray 118 9th Street Bellaire beach one concern I do have and I it parallels what Kim and um uh Fritz has said earlier 9th Street is crumbling I've heard that the equipment we're talking about putting it in the parking lot at the end of Ninth Street to do that I'm concerned that we're going to see more crumbling I would really love to see the parking go over here and not take it down private streets that's my request thank you and uh the city manager heard you loud and clear and I'm sure he will take that into consideration okay now let's go back to the roll call vote Patty council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel hi vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye so the resolution passes unanimously all right we are on to item number 17. this is for consideration of ordinance 23-02 Mr Mora thank you Mr Mayor this is Ordnance 23-02 on first reading an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellaire Beach Florida amending section 58-38 fines and procedures to increase the fines associated with parking violations providing for codification severability and for an effective date this has been a reading ordinance 23-02 by title only on first reading Mr Mayor thank you Mr Mora let's go to the citizens for uh comments on this ordinance as I see there are new citizens requesting to make comments we will close citizen comments and before we move forward I'm going to need a motion to approve this ordinance 23-02 make made by Frank Baker do I have a second second by Lloyd Roberts Mr Banker do you have the floor right now um we're looking to charge ten dollars per hour for parking with a three hour max or fine right now is 35 hours yeah you have to be a rocket scientist so would you rather spend 35 hours in park all day or spend ten dollars per hour for three hours so this is well needed to be increased and I think it should be moved um because just it just makes common sense thank you Mr Banker other comments from the council oh and I I agree with you also Mr Banker all right so let's uh go ahead and take this to a roll call vote Patty this is to approve ordinance 23-02. council member Banker yes council member Livingstone council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor Gaddis aye and so the ordinance passes unanimously and uh you are authorized to move forward with that first reading Mr Merritt will come back at a second that's right I'm sorry my bad all right uh so now we are on to item number 18. uh this is for authorization of for the city manager to advertise for Marina dock improvements this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefler uh Mr riesler take it away thank you mayor um so over the over the years um you know we have our pilings and our docks uh facilities out at the marina and um it's been wearing out uh through the the you know wave action salt water naturally um we've over probably let's see [Music] about the last 10 years um have been accumulating money for repair um so a little bit has been spent uh the last time was after damage from Hurricane Irma but uh prior to that it was probably uh pre-2015 I believe dolphin Marine actually did an overhaul to the pilings at the marina so um we're getting to the point where it's due we did a comprehensive inspection uh there's 140 Marina pilings not all of them are City maintained uh 64 of them are uh the slip Runners have actually installed for their Boat Lift so that is their responsibility to maintain them the remaining 76 piles are the city's responsibilities um these these function as uh typoles Mooring poles um and the supports to the catwalks um we the inspection shows where some of the pilings are fine just the to be cleaned and wrapped to others that need to be completely replaced and then there was a recommendation you'll see the blue squares which is to do a concrete jacket I think that decision was recommended basically because the uh the pilings are located under the catwalk so I'm requesting that authorization for city council to go out to bid for uh the the renovation that needs to take place at the marina um like I said we've had on accumulation of funding of fifty two thousand five hundred dollars I'm expecting this project to cost somewhere between thirty thousand and thirty five thousand um they want a bit of two two ways one way is to do the 38 re-rot re-wraps that were recommended and then 38 complete Replacements um so far in doing research and talking to vendors I think that the replacement option is the better option but I also wanted to explore the recommendation of uh concrete jackets just to weigh out the two options so that would be doing the 38 uh re-wraps uh 19 concrete jackets in the 19 Replacements um so yeah I included the marina inspection report uh hopefully I had time to look over it and then the other uh the other thing is that once uh once we get this bidded out we want to share this report to each slip Runner to make sure that they're aware of the condition of their Boat Lift pilings thank you Mr riefler before we continue I would like to go to the citizens for comments on agenda item number 18. oh all right citizen comments are closed and now we're back to the council uh Council anyone like to speak on this message Robert I just want to ask a question can you explain to me what a concrete jacket is they they form around it um I guess pump out the water and form concrete around the piling um what I've heard wood piling existing wood piling so as we know concrete does absorb water so it provides some protection to that piling but uh I feel the brand new pressure treated replacement is probably the better option I just wanted to explore both thank you Mr Roberts so what what's the anticipated life expectancy of a replacement versus a re-wrap that's the information that I want to to get I do not have that yet okay yeah and do we know that the cost difference between a replacement versus a cleaning wrap um so the cleaning wrap I believe the quote I got from the the company that provided the inspection I think was around two to three thousand per piling and then a complete replacement I want to say was closer to 7 000 and then that concrete jacket was somewhere in between okay um but yeah doing the re-wraps the cleaning of re-wraps um it just provides a a re uh another form of protection around it so that it gives a little bit more lifetime and the ones that aren't deteriorated okay and I'm obviously I'll leave that up to you Kyle but if if the um if the life expectancy is significant for replacement as compared to a ramp and we have the funding then maybe I would recommend that we go ahead and replace them all so we would have that done and complete it now and not have to worry about them for a while yeah that's how I feel and then you know if you do a replacement for this the ones that are recommended as a concrete jacket which are underneath the the deck boards you know require a little extra labor of pulling some deck boards or detaching the hardware okay for the supports but then but you know it would be worth it if we spend the the life period okay thanks any other questions or comments for the city manager on the subject nope okay uh I guess what we need to do now what I don't think that I actually did a motion on this one made a motion on this on this item okay Leslie nataro do I have a second second second by Frank Banker Leslie you have the floor well I think it's obvious that um Kyle has done his homework on this and knows what we're looking for and what to do and I think we need authorize him to go ahead any other comments no all right uh so this is for authorization of the city manager to advertise for Marina dock improvements all in favor any opposed all right Miss frankly you are authorized to proceed thank you man all right now to the good stuff this is for uh item number 19. uh consideration of Merit pay increase for city clerk based on annual evaluation criteria uh city manager reefler okay so um this you guys are all given the um the evaluations complete for uh City Clerk uh Patricia Patricia Gentry and um we've gotten all those in for the recommendations um do you have the summary of um I I don't have the actual are they my agenda here okay we don't have them in the agenda do we no they were this was the first time that I've seen where we did not receive a summary score of the overall um I just wasn't in the agenda pack is that data available no I don't have that I can get that if you want to take this off um I'm still waiting for one evaluation um so do you want to take it off and and I think I think it's it's fair that we are able to see all the scores and see uh how everyone rated you I I I hate to do that but uh would someone like to motion the table or would you like to proceed I I will do that if uh we retro her pay from tonight of course I think that's fair enough yeah that's yeah I think that's fair enough I'll get all the evaluations together and put together a tabulation okay uh well uh to entertain a motion a table if someone will make one motion to table to Retro or pay if your evaluations come in do I have a second second it's all in favor to table this item any opposed okay we'll we'll get this uh resolved next month and uh hopefully we can have these uh maybe for the next work session just so that we've got them and have time ample time to review them yes sir just one quick question Kyle so is there a fixed date that that this is supposed to an annual Merit increase date for padding she has that anniversary date that that Merit applies to um sometimes when you do employee evaluations they don't uh have their evaluation exactly on that date somewhere in that time period nearby and then it retro pays okay so had we approved it tonight she would have gotten it when I said Bloomer it's the beginning of April is April 1st that your anniversary duties okay so it's March okay so it's based on your anniversary date okay perfect okay thanks okay um let's not let that happen again uh just I I feel terrible I'm yeah but we have to we have to see everything okay um but that's not on you or them it that's mine it was my that I don't have that ready so please don't take any responsibility for that it's all me I'm sorry oh well uh no apology is necessary all right so now we are on to item number 20 uh which is consideration to support the nomination of Reddington Beach mayor David will as a representative to Ford Pinellas for the 10 Barrier Island communities um what is Ford Pinellas Ford Pinellas is a land use and transportation planning agency they guide integrated transportation and land use solutions to sustain economic value by connecting the communities of Pinellas County and the Tampa Bay Region effectively they they do a lot with traffic and how it may or may not affect us there are other things that that they are into but that's my biggest concern is traffic and where they route uh traffic so before I go any further I would like to ask the citizens for comments if anyone like to comment on this topic no comments uh we'll bring it back to the council to continue this discussion I need a motion from the council it's all moved lotion made by vice mayor Shirley do I have a second second by Lloyd Roberts uh vice mayor Shirley you have the floor well clearly the beaches need representation um I am not a huge supporter of forward Pinellas but I think the beaches get the raw end of the deal when it comes to um forward Pinellas um I I would love to see someone from our community be you know the representation for the beaches but and I don't know uh the mayor of Reddington Beach so I may be speaking out of turn by saying he's a good candidate but certainly someone along the beach and part of The Big C would be a good voice for us yes uh other comments where did I mean how did David will so so let me give you a little back story I normally allow everyone to to do their comments first but uh I'll kind of tell you what's going on um uh Ford Pinellas uh they have so many seats they pick the four largest communities uh in the county and each one of those communities automatically get a seat the Barrier Islands uh all 10 of them only get one representative because we're tiny okay so I was on the nominating committee for The Big C and um David will his name came up uh he his uh Community is much like ours they don't have businesses uh they they have some private areas they uh they are overran with traffic like we are from time to time uh also I've gotten to know David will pretty well and uh and I trust that I can have influence on David will and believe that he would look for into our best interest as he would his own because their common interest uh and and this is really good for us because that's not always been the case normally our representative that's placed uh by The Big C is always a tourism Community well this is the first time that we've had a representative who is not a tourism Community which means we're going to be more fairly represented uh there's a even deeper back story behind this also on the nominating committee uh it was not advertised but um the the uh the representative from the tourist Development Council uh was not reporting back to the Big C so we also uh decided to uh to replace that that representative or delegate with a new one and I was selected uh to to attend the T or to be on the TDC so what does that have to do with us because we don't attract tourists well it's all about where the money goes that comes in from tourism and as you know we are all impacted by all this tourism so we might as well have some impact on where the money goes and my number one goal will always be spend the money on renourishing our beaches so for the first time we have two people that are pretty much private communities that that don't they're not Commerce communities uh representing the Big C and I think it's going to be uh a great benefit for all the Barrier Islands to have it done this way so that's why I recommend that we move forward and uh approve David will thank you any questions so how does the mechanism work from this point so once once we say okay so so what it is is that every Barrier island has uh or uh The Big C has delegates from each Community okay from each municipality I'm one vote however uh the way that I cast a vote is if everyone agrees or we have a consensus that okay this is the what's good for the community in this case they're asking they're going to call a vote at the next big c meeting and I will be casting an official vote representing Bellaire Beach okay in support of David will mayor David will any other questions or comments no okay uh well in that case we need to take it to a boat and I can do that very very plainly just by saying all in favor aye aye aye aye any opposed all right so I will confirm our vote at the next big c meeting all right uh now we're on the item 21 there's a lot of these uh delicate um uh delicate votes tonight so just bear with me as we get through them all the next one is consideration of selecting council members as voting delegate alternate voting delegate number one and Alternate voting delegate number two for the Barrier Islands government Council known as The Big C do I have any citizens from the or any comments from the citizens nope all right back to the council before I begin I need a motion from the council to move forward with

much okay now we are on to item number 24 which is to authorize the City attorney to draft an ordinance uh to address section [Music] 38-87 of our city code to be presented and reviewed at our next work session would any citizens like to make a comment they're shaking their heads swiftly uh Council I need a motion to proceed on this so moved motion made by Leslie Notaro do I have a second second second by Jody Shirley uh council member nataria you have the floor um I think it's pretty clear that we need to address this and I think Randy will come here if I if I may please thank you um the the issue that added to the agenda this evening concerns specific specifically section 38-87 of the city's code um this issue came up not because of some kind of enforcement action or controversial event that took place in the city but rather in response to an advocacy group bringing this to the city's attention um the which happens from time to time I've reviewed the code section at issue what they've what they've asserted in in a roughly four page correspondence sent a week ago today I believe is when we received a week ago um is that the ordinance suffers various constitutional defects being void for vagueness and having content-based free speech limitations and unnecessary limitation or unjustifiable under strict scrutiny analysis uh restriction on the freedom of Association and freedom of assembly they've asked that we respond to them by April 10th um I will not suggest to you that they are going to idly buy and wait until April 10th to hear from us as evidenced by their advocacy in the last few days in the form of press releases and otherwise um that said having reviewed it I agree that the ordinance suffers defects and needs revision what those revisions look like I'd like a moment to to look at what um is what the language presently says and where this community wishes to go reviewing the history of this looks like the language at issue the language that is most at issue is 30 80 38-87 sub B which reads that no permits shall be granted by the city manager for the conduct of any commercial political or organized event by any person group or organizer that's not the only defective language if you will but the language that is most notable um what's interesting to me about that is that this language came in in 2018 through ordinance and number 1802 which saw at least ostensibly based on the minutes of the meeting at the time and the agenda materials to address um what at the time was uh various parties asking for to have weddings in city parks and bring chairs and other attendant uh elements that were perhaps congesting the the public gathering areas I'm not sure how that issue morphed into that language um but that was what the Boardman said before that the language came in of subpart a came in and ordnance0501 as part of an amendment to the city's code that was comprehensive in nature following this City's adoption of a city manager form of government so all the references to the member or the council member overseeing this was change city manager and then before that language goes back to 81 basically to your code's Origins on getting permits um and so it's not uncommon to have ordinances requiring permits for larger Gatherings or gatherings in certain places with some kind of rational relationship to ensuring that we don't have five people so you know for now five people but five groups all ingredients the same infrastructure at the same moment in Creed um uh congestion or controversy that way and so we can manage our resources but we have to do so in a manner that is content neutral um certainly not one that specifically targets political speech I I would I would shy away from that kind of language especially as we talked about Reed V Goldberg and sign codes and the sort of analysis that goes with those Free Speech the point they've made and that this advocacy group has made and I've made in the past is your streets and sidewalks are traditionally considered public fora which is that is where your free speech rights are at their highest this seems to move in some degree in contravention of that so yes I would like the opportunity to amend this ordinance yes I could prepare something for your review at a subsequent Workshop or meeting my only request is if there's a specific issue that this community feels this language is addressing or resolving that I made aware of that so that I capture what you the legislators wish to do within the confines of the U.S Constitution Florida Constitution and statutes the one other thing I would add to this I'm not remembering the statutory site off my head there's a similar constitutional Challenge and being being lodged against a statute that was adopted in the last two years last legislative session as part and parcel to the stop woke act and that's not language I'm making up that's what it was called addressing protests and streets and in in response to some of the public discourse that happened in 2020 there was a statutory change on where people can gather and impede slow stop traffic um this I that is to say to the extent that was a concern of this ordinance there's a statute on point whether or not that statute will support will sustain its own scrutiny as something else but I did wish to make sure you were aware of that context as well because that did not exist when this was adopted in 2018. thank you Mr Moore you're on a deadline or we are on a deadline to respond to yes by April 10th if I'm given your authority to draft an ordinance um this evening what I would respond to them be within you know the next couple days would be correspondence directing them you know thank you for bringing this to our attention I've received direction to amend this we intend to amend this and in in so doing intend to address any um apparent constitutional defects um or or other allegedly legal issues um which is to say that we're not at no point for what it's worth um at no point do we have any record of inciting somebody for violating this um at no point do we have any record to my knowledge of any permits denied specifically because all this is a political thing as some of you even mentioned to me inside conversations I'm pretty sure I did political speech of some sort on the city Side never had an issue um so um you know with that said I would respond to them and indicate that is to say that to the extent they reached out to us in the last week we have not once replied to them and said this is our ordinance you know get lost we're standing by it and it's fine all we ask for was the opportunity to review it um and that's what we intend to do great thank you uh we have uh we have two council members who were actually uh voted on that um would either of you like to uh it just kind of explain why the ordinance was changed I know it kind of kind of touched on it but you were there and you may or may not remember I wasn't there you were not there so you were not on council at the time I don't remember you don't remember okay good answer okay uh well I just thought I'd give them the opportunity uh would anyone uh like to uh tell you what before we go any further uh let's see I need to make a motion on this one or did we already do it I am so I'm so lost that's right that's right okay great great I'm sorry yeah I made the motion I got completely caught up in that I made the motion okay all right so uh would anyone like to make any other comments on this okay we all know why we're here and uh and and what what we're trying to do and uh at least they will know that we are responding to their request and uh and are not giving them any pushback on it uh so uh that being said uh all in favor any opposed all right and I apologize for getting caught up in the moment there Mr Moore you're authorized to draft an ordinance to address uh section 38-87. thank you Mr Mayor do you think it's possible we will have that draft by the work session um remind me that is the next work session the 17th uh mysteries from today yeah Monday two weeks from today yeah I think that's reasonable mayor thank you sorry to uh burden you with a extra load there all right uh now we are on to item 25 unfinished business any unfinished physics I think uh most of the things that uh were we've been discussing uh were have already been covered so we're good there so now we're on to item number 26 uh which is city council comments this month the randomizer program has selected council member Livingstone all right take it away oh thank you that was a surprise uh no thank you all for being here this evening um thank you Kyle for everything that you do for the city and in Patty as well we really appreciate you and we're sorry that we weren't able to pass that on this evening and we'll make sure that it gets taken care of next time so thank you step is council member nataro no comments no comments uh Mr Roberts you're right yeah I just wanted to make a comment um based on John's comment earlier Mr hansick so um as you as you heard from city manager that he's setting up a meeting with the county representative so I also just wanted to reiterate to you there was a comment made at the conclusion of our meeting last month that somebody had recommended you know maybe it's best to just let this issue go and not change anything I want everybody to know that that's not why I was elected so if there's any ever an opportunity to improve something in the city I'm going to pursue that I can tell you right now I I feel like you do that the current design of that system and not to throw stones at whomever made those decisions previously this is not a good a good traffic pattern that's going on now so I know there's better ways to do it and I'm confident that working with Kyle on getting input from other City members we're going to make it better and working with the county so there's improvements to be made and any final recommendation that we make will clearly be a benefit to the entire city in the discussion so that's the plan thank you Mr Roberts Mr Banker you're up uh just briefly uh as we begin Holy Week yesterday wish all a blessed Easter pray that all Belair Beach residents appreciate this masterpiece of God by his grace we get the call home thank you Mr Banker nicely said uh Mr zabel uh yeah uh this past month we had a loss of a friend of many of us in the community and a family member of Miss Joanne McIntyre just want to go with condolences to you Mr Mayor Wendy Michael and uh Mr Bob McIntyre as well she's a wonderful lady and secondly um I know it's running over time here but a lot of you out there are still here with us we really appreciate that but more importantly I want to publicly thank each of the council members I mean council member Banker Livingstone Terrell Roberts vice mayor Shirley mayor Gaddis for what you do I mean I was away last week but you take time out of your families uh lives to be here not only to be here but to prepare do the working sessions and everything else I just want to thank you all for that thanks thank you Mr zabel uh vice mayor Shirley so I'd just like to take a minute to thank um a local non-profit called Shepherd's Village it's a single family parenting program just over the bridge in Bellaire Bluffs they sent a group of kids over here to City Hall from Indian Rocks School Indian Rocks Christian School it was their missions week and they did quite a bit of landscape cleanup around City Hall Kyle can tell us a little more about it but there was quite a pile of debris that I got a photograph of that they did a really great job and helped you know the community a bit and then also I just want to thank all of our boards for giving us a quarterly report it's nice to hear from everyone I appreciate it I appreciate everything that everyone's doing a little disappointed we didn't hear from Planning and Zoning again I know they have a project they're working on so it would have been nice for them to show up to the meeting today and thanks for hanging in there guys appreciate it thank you Miss Shirley all right concerning Beach nourishment this month I was able to meet on different days with county commissioner Chris labala and the Pinellas Public Works director Kelly Levy they're both on board with 100 funding if the Army Corps will not budge uh commissioner County Commissioner Janet long uh Kelly Levy and any of rock speech mayor uh cookie Kennedy met with representative Luna who has confirmed that she will approach the Army Corps from an environmental impact perspective to see if she can gain any traction so far I've seen no evidence of any uh Beyond let's just keep our fingers crossed mayor Kennedy seemed hopeful at the last big c meeting but my gut tells me that County funding and management are the only way that we will get sand anytime soon if that happens it will still take at least two years to complete the project for the most part I would say that I've I've received very little pushback however uh let's see what happens whenever the uh uh whenever whenever they finally give us a final no we're not going to do this and you must get all your easements or else so we'll see how that goes but I have confidence with a little more influence on the TDC and Ford Pinellas we we may be able to turn up the pressure a little bit more and uh uh we'll see what happens so uh let's just uh keep the faith and and uh wait and see as always I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight as well as for those who are watching Wherever You Are Tonight uh do I have a motion to adjourn motions exactly made by Frank bankert second by Mike Sable all in favor aye aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
