citizens of Beller Beach let me let me pause you for one second we'll reset your time would you please give us your name Kathleen klaser and I live on 21st Street 106 21st Street I know all of you okay today I wanted to discuss geoengineering and its effect on clean air I've provided a two-page explanation of this to our city you can get a copy from our city clerk I am advocating for clean air above all without all of us breathing all projects at Miller Beach become worthless we won't be here I could not get this information to you in three minutes allotted please request a copy why is it important to understand how geoengineering global warming and globalist goals are affecting our air to recover our health and the health of our planet many of you may not know that it will take three years for all the particulate manner dispersed into our atmosphere through chemical aerial dispersion or geoengineering to settle to the Earth if all geoengineering has stopped immediately you may also be surprised to know that we had three major volcanic eruptions within the last two weeks March 28th in Papua New Guinea March 27th in Japan and currently an ongoing volcano Advantage vanity these natural eruptions will cause cause sulfur dioxide spinning around the atmosphere for approximately one and a half years sulfur dioxide it's also used in geoengineering to dim the Sun and cool the planet the geoengineering plus natural infusion of sulfur dioxide into our atmosphere through volcanoes will cause greater dimming of the sun causing even lower temperatures worldwide leading to food production failure undulations in temperature and humidity will Fast Track crop failures and food shortages as plants struggle to survive please look at the website adapt 2030 that would give a lot of good information on this information it is more important now than ever to stop geoengineering we are more fortunate than most States and that we only have our Northern borders shared with other states if we stop aerial dispersions now most of our state can start healing quicker and those states that are land than those states that are landlocked global warming is a farce it will be used as a lie to cover up what's coming we're on the solar Max of our 11-year solar cycle we had five more years of warmth before we head into a normal natural cooler solar cycle watch for the weaponizing of these lies propaganda coming your way to cover the crop failures of global cooling now that the Earth will be cooling faster than expected what do they do with their global warming narrative now please review the references I provided in the speech these were items I was going to talk about and you'll have to get my speech to know what they're about but I would help anybody in

warrant under Deputy activity you can see there were a total of 649 events in the city leading that as always direct the patrols traffic enforcement and parking enforcement next there was one crash within the city that occurred at golf and Causeway and I will Circle back to that there were a total of 147 citations and warnings issued touching on the crash that was at Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard last month if you'll remember I was asked whether or not if I could determine the causation of that crash at that particular intersection I did look it up and it looks like it was distracted driving it was a three vehicle crash they were trying to turn north coming from westbound on Causeway to turn north on golf and the file the last vehicle in line struck the vehicle in front which subsequently struck the vehicle in front other than that that is it thank you Sergeant do we have any questions or comments from the council thank you very much thank you all right next up code enforcement report good evening Deputy Steve klapka for the record um Commissioners mayor again we had another active month with uh some of these code enforcement violations as you can see on your sheets that the the biggest one we're still having problem with is the dealing with the contractors permits and unlicensed individuals there's still a few of them that I am following up on uh through the building department along with the construction licensing board the other event that we had was the short-term rental uh just this past week we had a hearing again on two different violations at the same residence and we have another one coming up in uh this Thursday at that same residence other than that that's my report I'll stand for any questions thank you Deputy do we have any questions for the deputy come on you're doing a great job thank you sir great evening thank you very much thank you all right next up uh we have the presentation from the Pinellas Suncoast fire and rest rescue District that would be Chief Davidson [Music] good evening everyone I wanted to give you the monthly report and tell you um I was at the fundraiser the kayak lunch fundraiser and what a great time I'm glad to see that they raised the money that they needed for that but what a great time thank you very much uh in the month of April we had 15 calls for emergency services into Bel Air Beach uh I know that I've talked to you before that I'm working diligently on getting an additional fire department unit that's fully staff fully funded uh by the county and no additional cost to our taxpayers these taxpayers already pay that money and I'm asking for the county to fund that unit and my plan is to move um a truck to be here closer here to Service Bel Air Beach so I had one meeting last week with the county I have one tomorrow and then one at the end of May and I really urge you to write to your msac committee Emergency Services advisory Council and write to your County Commissioners this is the time of year that they make budget decisions and it gets pushed up to the County Commissioners and this enhancement is a dire need to better serve our communities um so I urge you to do that on June 8th 2023 uh we are hosting right here in Bel Air Beach we're hosting a hurricane in water safety Expo uh you should have a flying family but there's some flyers in the back there as well and that's June 8th 2023 from 1 to 6 p.m uh well they'll have some vendors here they're going to do a life jacket giveaways uh Beach and boat safety information if you meet your local firefighters there'll be a couple of uh meteorologists one from Channel 10 Tampa Bay and one from Bay News 9. and the Pinellas Suncoast professional firefighters uh Union will be hosting a cookout out here until supplies last and I guess they'd be burgers and hot dogs and things like that um and we're also planning to do a uh demonstration with our our fire boat here our marine Rescue Unit um and that is scheduled for 2 30 but the schedule's on the back of the flyer up on the table there and we hope to have a great day with you all thank you Chief uh do we have any questions or comments for chief Davidson council's very quiet tonight I I have a yes oh we did have one because I'm way down here in the end Floyd Roberts so just a quick question on the um the cookout is that well that started because that's very important to me well that start at one o'clock or do you know at this point I do not know that part is sponsored by the union okay but I'll make sure I find out any any special requests like what time you like to eat there sir um not really just continuously all right continuous all right well it says while supplies last but I will find out exactly what what time they're gonna cook out thank you and I'll let you know all right all right and you can see where council members Roberts uh priorities uh I did have a um a couple of questions for you uh this morning there was a a golf cart uh that somehow caught on fire yes first off do you know anything about how that fire started and it's a two-part question and then the second part I noticed that the truck was coming from Largo that came into service that fire um so can you give us some details on it yes I can uh so uh that was just after eight o'clock this morning it was in the 24th Avenue in Iraq's beach in Northern end and the call came in as just a golf cart smoking and it was I was actually driving in and I thought there was a lot more than a golf cart on Fires you know a lot of thick black smoke pouring across and and until we get there and decide what's you know determine what's on fire you know we asked for more for more people because it looked like possibly You're Building A lot of times Vehicles will catch on fire inside a garage or next to another car things like that so um but that so I was the first one there but I just happened to be on the road the engine from Station 27 their first due to that area but they were out so the second due to that area um is clear waters 44 which on on Sand Key so they were coming and when I was about a half mile away I could see so much black smoke which is an indicator there's a something burning um that I had asked for additional units and they dispatched uh the rest of the units as if we were responding to a structure fire which is a total of 15 more people um so that might be what you saw when when Largo was coming across the bridge was on that fire response but then when I got there I could see it was uh the golf cart that was fully involved it had caught the power pole on fire you know we call the power company out to make sure the pool's safe and everything but um as far as the cause uh hasn't been determined most likely it was from somewhere in the batteries there you know a charging issue uh it wasn't plugged in it was just sitting there and uh looked like the public beach access somebody had pulled it in there you know all right can I just ask is it electric or gas uh no that was battery operated okay yes ma'am all right uh the only other uh uh comment I have or actually request is I noticed that you gave us some statistics on uh emergency services that were provided in the city of Bellaire Beach is there any way that you could maybe provide us with those uh like give them to or email Patty absolutely for the meeting so we can kind of look them over I think we uh normally our meetings are on Monday and we shut down uh incoming documentation for the agendas on Wednesday absolutely I would appreciate it and I'm happy to share that with you and I'm happy to explain everything uh how they come up with those numbers and what everything means all right any other questions or comments for the fire chief no all right thank you very much thank you okay uh next up did Mr Blanton make it I have not I don't believe so okay we were expecting a presentation from the Pinellas County uh Metropolitan planning organization membership reapportionment plan uh wet Blanton okay uh what I'm going to request uh is that we we table this one and then bring it back up if uh uh if he comes in if that's okay with the council we'll just continue on all right item six presentation um where is the presentation yeah let me uh yeah that was the plan Heather's not here tonight she didn't want to come in that will work all right I'd like a city manager reefer to meet me uh thank you foreign so what I have here is an award of financial reporting achievement is presented to the finance department city of Bellaire beach by the government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada what that means is that we're doing everything right and uh uh we're there we're not failing any audits we're doing everything to a standard that's the highest standard you can get for a municipality so congratulations to city manager reefler and uh and the rest of the city staff and our accounting firm thank you very much all right item seven city attorney's report Mr Mori you have the floor thank you Mr Mayor good evening all of you as far as uh legal updates we'll start with the legislative session we have about four days left of the legislative session and then our can hopefully be a little less tense at least for me uh we're we're continuing to monitor um a number of pieces of legislation I I emailed you this weekend about Senate Bill 774 on the financial disclosures I'm not totally clear how to read the where that is on the Senate side it unequivocally passed the Senate it's house corollary says that there's a there's an indication it was laid on the table um but then it says referencing uh reference that the Senate Bill substitute so I can't tell if that means when something's laid on the table for the house that means it's equivalent to voting it down especially at this stage in the legislature I can't tell if they're saying the house version has been laid on the table and we're now proceeding on the substitute or if the house isn't moving on this it'd be kind of surprising for how overwhelmingly it passed in the Senate to not see something in the house I suspect it's the former as I advised over the weekend that they're just proceeding on the Senate version but I will of course let you know um continuing to track that another bill that was of interest to um one of the members here specifically was Senate Bill 154 and it's house corollary 1395 on the condo bills um and and that that was the condo inspections and sort of depending on how you look at that making it more flexible um in light of the different needs of condominium communities across the state that has been laid on the table in the house it doesn't look look like that'll be passing this session one bill that's gained a lot of attention in this immediate area is Senate Bill 714 Senate Bill 714 has to do with the regulation of short-term rentals it passed the how past the Senate late last week Senate Bill 714 makes it it's it is being characterized publicly as giving tools to local governments to regulate short-term rentals my I think I spoke to this at some length last month I would say that anything different than you have home rule powers for everything except these three things we're already under the impression we have those tools we don't need this and once you start listing them it suggests everything else is off the table um it did pass the Senate uh it is going before the house if it's going it is it is in messages to the house the house did not hear it today that I'm aware of though we're still tracking sessions so you know things can change moment to moment um that there was of less import here I don't want to get everybody freaking out um you have regulations and restrictions for short-term rentals that predate June of 2011 which is a magic date in this legal regime and and the reason that magic date exist it dates back to they passed the first version of this preemption in the 2011 session and said as long as you don't as long as it exists before June 2011 you can keep it and they've kept that construct there have been a few efforts over the years to say to even take that away that did not come up this session so it shouldn't be of terrible impact here as long as we don't go tinkering with our short-term rental restrictions but you can see that the concerns in a lot of your other Beach communities that may not be in that or or communities across Florida that may not be in that that same position um as indicated uh this bill passed the Senate there was strong indication during the session during which it passed that Senate leadership was behind this where leadership is supported something it seems more indicative that it's likely to pass especially again given the numbers this session with one party being in power and the governor being of that same party it seems especially now that there's a push a lot of the front end of the first month of session has been publicly characterized as the legislature largely passing much of the governor's requests and initiatives legislatively in this last two or three weeks has been the legislature playing catch up again their initiatives out even if something passes the house and the Senate as you well know it still needs the governor's signature not sure he hasn't articulated anything that he would explicitly be vetoing this session that doesn't mean he won't do it we just don't know what those things are all of that to say we will session ends Friday we'll we'll know better at least what has the possibility of being signed uh there is not a hard timeline it's this weird thing uh once they pass the House and Senate they go to the governor's desk he doesn't have to sign them all by like May 15th or June 1st last year we were waiting in July to see if some things would be signed um in fact I remember talking to members Shirley while I was at a continuing education course we were saying at that course we're still waiting to see if he's going to sign us some bill so it is entirely possible uh that after session ends we'll still there will still be a little bit of a guessing game on where things are going to lie but given um the governor's Current public profile it seems he's going to be eager to show that he's getting things done and moving them moving them along there were a few bills signed as recently as uh this afternoon um so that's where we stand on the legislative session uh something that has been brought up either in my report or otherwise over the last few months is the matter of the uh property with the radio antenna tower uh I I I exchanged correspondence with their attorney uh just this afternoon um at the on April 13th he'd send some correspondence indicating he intended to have it done by the end of the month um today being May first I said you know we've abated code enforcement in life in in Reliance on this where do you stand he said it'll be submitted Wednesday there was a technical issue given the volume of the document and transmitting it it's going to have a propagation study he says it should be roughly 80 pages of of submission so it will be substantive it won't be a you know a hand-drawn thing and two sheets of paper and of course the staff will have to review that and and make sure that it you know see what I just can't speak to what the result of that would be because um it has to go through review but that is where we stand we should have that submission this week um likely by Wednesday um other than that um I'm happy to answer any questions you have I don't have anything else that uh I think I need to communicate at this time Council all right I just want to thank you for pushing that issue on the uh permit um if things been up now for over a year um and I did some research on myself I can't find any of those Towers that would be wind resistant over 90 miles per hour and I'm not there to look at the permit or anything like that but I appreciate you keeping on this and I hope you hold his feet to the fire and I know you sent some information to that effect um and and of course we will look to that as a resource as as staff conducts its review once we have the documents and it may inform follow-up questions if there are any thank you any other questions or comments City attorney I appreciate all the updates uh it it sort of looks like Bel Air Beach is uh is a minority as far as the thinking on short-term rentals and uh and what's going on uh there's it's little towns here and there that are in a unique position like we are where we're in our grandfathering but um whenever I attend the various meetings around the county there's very few people like us left in Pinellas County I I think you're in the minority based on your posture in having some kind you know having that grandfathered protection because again that industry really emerged began to emerge airbnb's pilot program was I believe it was the Democratic National Convention a fee from apart from a few trade shows back in 2008 and so you know that was really a nascent industry and government doesn't typically respond to Tech that quickly that is to say that yes you I there are not a lot of communities outside of unless you were like a Key West or this is your whole industry and you're trained to regulate this um but I think you're in the majority of communities in Florida who don't understand why you're being told how to regulate your local community and being told that however you choose to do that whether it's to open the floodgates or otherwise that that should be defined by the state you know I think that there's been the history of Florida on home rule going back to 1968 and the character that it's developed Community to community community to community throughout the states the reason why Anna Maria is different than Bella Beach is different than Juno Beach that's how that evolves but once you make those uniform regulations it makes it a lot more difficult for this place to have quiet charm in this place to be where you go for the resort and um so I think you're in the majority of state of cities and and or municipalities who would just wish to preserve the status quo of being able to regulate as you see fit uh would you consider 7 14 bait instead of a solution I'm sorry what I consider it what was the verb ate baked um sorry that that term invoke something else in my mind um I would say that I would consider 714 to be masquerading as something that is not okay fair enough that's all I have thank you very much all right move on to automate city managers report take away Mr reefler thank you mayor I'll start off with the undergrounding project as you've probably seen we have a whole bunch of conduit roles and conduit pipe at the city marina on the southern end they're trying to tuck it away for the storage of the project we have all the materials except for the four inch conduit rolls which is actually what the majority of things to be installed um on the project uh got correspondence with the uh contractor today in hopes that it would be delivered this week and if so I'll get official uh you know declaration that they'll be stopped what date they'll be starting and I'll pass that along to you so that's that's exciting because once we have the materials I know they'll get going on it and they'll be moved through rather quickly um the storm water Improvement projects that was the last meeting we got the note approved to cover the remaining bmps of the stormwater master plan that is an agenda item that is on the regular agenda the children's playground replacement um as you can see it's been removed the old playground we actually received 300 for it the used playgrounds company actually gave us a check uh the it was good that we removed it because the support poles on it were very rusted and those couldn't be utilized so they did give us some money for what it was worth to them um the new playground should be come in this week and it has a install and installer set up to receive the delivery and they should be able to get it in pretty quickly so we'll finally get that done um Personnel policy I've gotten that back from the consultant I'm doing some some review edits answering some questions and then I will pass it along to Mr Mora's legal firm to to review to make sure it's uh where it needs to be as far as employment law goes uh Grant policy that was on the city managers goals I would like to bring it to the next work session I'm working on an administrative policy to get the council's input on that uh as a reminder I have the uh fccma conference to attend it'll be the Memorial Day week uh which is Tuesday through Thursday so that's May 30th through June 2nd and some other notes I made we installed the park mobile system and it's operational during the transition period we put some we shut down the meters the physical meters and put some signs on it to direct the customers to use Park Mobile and the uh I think I believe that was on a Wednesday and then the first weekend we actually we did over four thousand dollars worth of sales so people are using it um the first two weeks I recommend it to the deputies that we do not ticket if they have not paid that we we got all these little wallet cards that was provided by Park Mobile um to give them a warning and give them a how-to Wallet card uh you know to ease the transition um so uh last weekend wasn't a good example I tried to pull numbers on that too I believe we only did about 400 but with the weather um it was explainable so um the staff actually started to remove the physical meters uh today um some of the slab the slab at the Marine is awfully thick so they're trying to come up with a creative solution to get that one out of there but I've been in contact with the uh flowberg it was a company that we uh bought those from and hopefully get those sold back to get some money recouped from um the arpa money we did our first report and we reported the use of this uh 7000 or 753 000 of the 802 um 800 2000 so that has been reported the remaining money will go towards whatever spent more expenses we have in the stormwater account but just to let you know that um that has been reported because we have to do that throughout the year um the city with the help of the citizens advisory uh committee chair Ron saganic is entertaining switching banks to Valley which is over the bridge um if you're familiar before the gas station on the left they're offering uh 50 bonus points above the target fed fund for the interest which is much better than we're getting from truest who we're currently with currently with and um they're also not going to charge us any any banking fees and uh we currently you know on a monthly basis you know 100 200 worth of fees that we won't have to pay anymore so Heather and I are going to go to the branch and meet with them on Friday and if everything looks good then we'll probably be asking for Signature signature cards from you guys to to transfer over and we'll do it over time so that um we have a council but in both places it's easy to transition and uh Heather is working on putting the budget together to deliver back to me uh I believe our calendar says either the 12th or the 13th but I'd like once I have the budget um to distribute it to you guys and uh you have some meetings one-on-ones to talk it talk it over what I'm planning on doing this year and before we have our uh our first budget meeting that's all I have thanks for the detailed report uh questions or comments from the city manager is there a second page to the city manager's report that there is none there's no second page this time okay yeah um Park Mobile I didn't put it as an actual project and then it was just more reporting okay the questions yes Mr Banker the increase is is it supposed to I thought it was supposed to go into effect like midnight or 1201 a.m Friday morning um and the five dollars to ten dollars an hour or is that Center no that was that was set by resolution right so when uh when we made the transition to park mobile I had it set up with the new fees we have the second reading of the fines ordinance changing um so that if passes tonight will be in effect and then my plan was to actually start ticketing this week after that ordinance has been passed I guess the simple question is is Friday after um I forget that the hours that we gave free parking here does it go to ten dollars or does it stay oh I'm sorry the the rate change um that is uh weekends and holidays so Friday is five dollars an hour and then Saturday Sunday and holidays yeah is it ten dollars I was here to pick up my book Friday night when I punched it in it was still five dollars and I thought it was I thought we were going to go to ten dollars on Friday but I did not have I had weekends and holidays okay all right thank you don't entertainment chair whatever it is it might not be a bad idea to have uh the rates published on the website just so that we know okay any other questions or comments for the city manager thank you very much Mr riesler thank you all right we are up to item nine city clerk's report Miss Gentry um this is just a quick recap of April um which seems like so long ago the city yard sale that was you know pretty uh went off really well so the attorney Maura gave his government in the sunshine which that was well attended now people were thankful for that we had a flood insurance Workshop that gave up updates on flood insurance here at uh in the council chambers the mayor and Council gave their luncheon to thank all the board committee and Foundation members and the committee members of the foundation and the boards they were all very appreciative and they were very appreciative they expressed that and the audit committee annual comprehensive financial report the final meeting on that should be May 3rd um they hope that that will be their final meeting and then the Planning and Zoning comprehensive plan review um their final meeting will probably be the ninth and that's their birthday update any questions or comments for the city clerk all right thank you very much Miss Gentry I appreciate it right all right up next is item 10. this is consideration of ordinance 23-02 this is the second reading Mr Mora thank you Mr Mayor it says ordinance 23-02 an ordinance of the city council the city of Bellair Beach Florida amending section 58-38 finds and procedures to increase the fines associated with parking violations providing for codification severability and for an effective date this has been a second and final reading of ordinance 23-02 by title only thank you Mr Mora before we go to the council for debate I would like to open the floor to the citizens would anyone like to speak on this topic okay citizen comments are closed uh before we open discussion I'm going to need a motion to approve Ordinance 23-02 do I have a motion motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second by Leslie Notaro Mr Banker do you have the floor boys no during the first reading I stated that the current fine is only 35 hours and I just noted that we raised the parking fees I thought it was on Fridays too but the ten dollars per hour so it made no sense to keeping up keeping them at 35 hours because you can park all day for 35 hours and our time now is only three hours so even though the fines are still a little bit low in my opinion I hope this motion passes thank you Mr Banker do we have any other comments or questions on this one all right uh Mr bankert I'm going to give you one last word if you'd like all right uh so uh Patty has this ordinance been noticed in publication yes sir right in that case let's take it to a boat Patty would you please call the roll council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes councilmember Notaro [Music] council member Roberts aye council member Sable aye vice mayor Shirley aye mayor goddess aye so the ordinance passes uh unanimously and that's ordinance 23-02 all right so now we are on to the consent agenda items 11 through 13B uh this is for approval of April 3rd 2023 city council meeting minutes this do authorize the city manager to execute an interlocal agreement between Pinellas County and local governments for their Cooperative procurement I had a dental work today bear with me uh procurements of disaster debris collection and removal services and disaster debris monitoring and Management Services within Geographic Pinellas County also a proclamation recognizing this week as the 54th annual professional Municipal clerks week and a proclamation recognizing the month of May as Lupus Awareness Month all in favor aye aye aye any opposed all right the consent agenda passes but I'm going to go ahead and uh I'm going to break out this Proclamation uh concerning the professional Municipal clerks week because uh I think we have a wonderful Clerk and uh this deserves to be read so even though it's already uh it's already official I'm going to go ahead and and uh read it to everyone right quick this is Proclamation uh the 54th annual professional Municipal clerks week it's April 30th through May the 6th 2023. whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk a time-honored and vital part of local government exists throughout the world and whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk is the oldest among public servants and whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk provides the professional link between citizens the local governing bodies and agencies of government at other levels and whereas professional Municipal clerks have pledged to be ever mindful of their neutrality and impartiality rendering equal services to all whereas the professional municipal clerk serves as the uniform or I'm sorry is the information center on functions of local government and Community whereas professional Municipal clerks continually strive to improve the administration of the Affairs of the office of the professional municipal clerk through participation in education programs seminars workshops and the annual meetings of their state provincial County and international professional organizations whereas it is most appropriate that we recognize the accomplishments of the office of the professional municipal clerk now therefore I Dave Gaddis mayor of the city of Bellaire Beach do recognize the week of April 30th through May 6 2023 as professional Municipal clerks week and further extend appreciation to our professional municipal clerk Patricia Gentry and to all professional Municipal Clerks for the vital Services they perform and their exemplary dedication to the communities they represent represent dated this first day of May 2023. thank you now we are on to item number four I'm sorry yes yeah if it's okay I'd like to make a just a quick comment on the um great job our city manager did in whatever he did in our city in the interlocal agreement with Pinellas County and the debris cleanup and the reason for that is how important it is if we were to do that on our own I have seen from a history standpoint that regardless of the agreement you may have with companies out there when it comes time uh even though you have a signed agreement in place they're going to go typically for the highest paid options available the fact that this is with Pinellas County a much much larger group in all the cities that have signed it as well less likely to happen so this is a great idea and I think that positions the city very well for being able to have those Services provided if and when we ever need them so good job thanks thank you Mr Roberts all right we are now on to item 14. uh this is for authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated or stormwater Master drainage plan DPMS this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefer Mr reefer thank you mayor so this is for authorization to execute the purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Incorporated this is to complete the design and Engineering Services for stormwater master plan updated in 2016. um the remaining bmps which stands for the best management practices for the for the drainage program and it would be number 6 9 10 11 12 13 and 14. IT addresses the streets in those areas which is Ninth Street Harbor Drive Cedar Drive Spruce Drive Palm Drive 14th Street 15th Street 16th Street 17th Street 18th Street 19th Street 20th Street 21st Street 23rd Street 24th Street 25th Street and Morgan Drive um the amount of the PO to be executed is 360 000 and 300 360 374. so low history and like I said the the master drainage plan was um updated in 2016. um since then uh there were 15 bmps uh we prioritized eight of those 15 um have been completed um the last council meeting on April 3rd we approved the note to provide funding to complete the additional seven bmps um since then I presented the Project's scope to all six engineering firms that we've signed agreements with from our RFQ put out uh I believe December the um I told them that the timeline I'd like to hit was to have the complete uh 100 construction plans and technical specifications uh ready for competitive bidding by August 15th of those six I heard back confirmation from four that they could meet that timeline of those four I selected Gemini engineering and Sciences which is actually it came out to be our highest ranked from the RFQ this project is going to include repairing and or replacing stormwater pipes and Inlet structures it's going to replace all the valley Curbing and resurfacing of the payment and on all those streets I mentioned earlier um I also have included the lining of the pipe segments from the uh closest Inlet to the sea wall on 12th Street and 13th Street which from the last project it was determined that needed to be done in the future uh we thought it would get a better cost uh line you know uh pricing I guess as I should say for the for doing the lining along with this project because I'm sure there's going to be some other lining that is going to be in the design um it's important to note that Gemini engineering and Sciences is going to reanalyze each BMP and design plans to best address the deficiencies that the city has and we want to achieve the highest benefit the cost ratio so the money we put in we want to see the biggest impact I've started drafting the work authorization agreement for this job based on the proposal which I've included the engineering Sciences Incorporated proposal the BMP project maps from the stormwater master plan as well as the continuing contract for Professional Services that was signed and the uh I made a note there that the CLI will be updated because I think it expires thank you for uh for the description of the this uh contract and uh before we go to the council we need to go to the citizens would anyone like to comment on this project uh yes John Hancock 22nd Street um I'm assuming that the sewer was lined which would be on the south side of the median recently because that's what I've they were doing now going back a little bit when they did work back there in Bellaire Island Estates they paved from the bridge to Gulf Boulevard both sides of the median and I remember having a conversation with Mr Lynn Reeves about the damaged Valley curbing between Bayshore and Gulf but that would be replaced at such time as they got up towards that end of the city I just was glancing through there and I see nothing that indicates there's any consideration for repairing not repairing replacing damaged Valley Curbing and I have a significant amount in front of my property and I'm sure there's others between Bayshore and Gulf so my question is West 22nd Street omitted or is it included in this bid [Applause] so we're still doing we're doing the design phase so that is something that we can look into and if uh um you know while doing the other curbing it would be the ideal time to to replace what needs to be done there um given that the street has already been resurfaced um there's you know it won't be as neat but I will have that looked at thank you Miss Transit uh Miss Durham hi I'm Lou Durham again um I don't understand construction or anything of what you're talking about but I heard 12th and 13th Street still needs something done to seal the huh is my question okay so towards the end of the uh project we did inspections on the pipes um that were uh run between the homes um there were we couldn't access uh without you know tearing up the ground in that area um and discovered that um they're not failing um but they are deteriorating and it was recommended by the engineer that we get those lined um we felt that during this large project um that we have coming up that if we include it in the bid we're going to get competitive pricing um ideal pricing for that job that's that's between the homeowner's property and the new sewers that were put in so these pipes are from the inlets on uh Bay Drive okay um the ones that at the end of 12th and 13th Street respectively and they run from those inlets uh right down the property lines to the Sea walls okay so I don't have to pull up the street again do you no it uh they'll go through the manhole um it's it's it's exactly what they're doing to the uh actual uh sewer system that the County's doing right now with those trucks they'll run uh here in place um piping through the pipes and then is there anything that uh we as homeowners are supposed to do to prepare for this or will we get a notice of some kind or does it matter um we can we will send out a notification through our Constant Contact to let you know um when they're in the area because typically when we do um our storm water projects we do uh door hangers to notify all the residents in those areas that you know something's about to occur um but I can't say exactly we'll know during the construction phase when they plan on moving over and doing the lining of those streets um and then we can give you are we talking years now in or no it'll last uh maybe two days we're probably doing a one that the company that did the work on our street just did a superlative job I mean they just they came back they fixed anything that was wrong and they did it in like a record time you know so I hope to have a little bit on these next project okay I'm just surprised to hear there is still anything left to do yeah so it'll be it'll be seamless um should take matter days okay um and then from there everything will be ready thank you very much welcome thank you thank you Mr Durham any other questions or comments from the citizens concerning this topic oh all right uh so before we begin debate on this uh we're going to need a motion uh on this on this uh authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering would someone like to make a motion so moved um motion made by Lloyd Roberts would someone like to second that second second by Jody Shirley vice mayor Shirley Mr Roberts you have the floor thank you mayor I think this is uh the appropriate path we're taking which is excellent we're going to have one engineering firm come in and review the bmps that are already in place via previous engineering firm is that correct in addition to the new areas to be designed so this would be a great opportunity for the city as well as anybody on this counselor that wants to be involved to make sure that we review that work with the city manager to be comfortable that the direction that the city is going as Kyle mentioned earlier is the most a cost effective process that we'll be pursuing so I think it's a great idea I'm very happy this is the direction we're going and I think it's best for the city thank you other comments or questions I have a question if I can I noticed that Gemini is out of Jacksonville do they have local offices yes they have an office in St Petersburg okay we have and did we have other bids from other local engineers not for this project but the way uh our agreement is set up but we we can't actually competitively bid Engineering Services um because it's uh prohibited by the CCNA so I noticed this is uh Larry Flutie again are you yeah he'll be the Principal um and I've met his other staff during the uh the RFQ interview process and there is staff so I know there's been some lays in the past using him and he's got staff to support him he does yes Mr rafler um will they also be making recommendations on The Logical order uh that this project should be rolled out yes it'll be designed um as best as possible when we lay out the plans I mean it's bid on because [Music] um let me check into that because I don't know the extent we can tell the uh construction company to do how that will affect the bidding process so I need to think that okay the reason why I ask is I just would hate to attack small problems in front of big problems and uh I I think it would be uh in our best to attack the bigger problems first unless they're just unless it's just this huge financial burden to do that um so the project construction phase is proposed to be 365 days um we can try to tighten that up when we actually go out to bid um we the intention is to get it done as quickly as possible and we think that the contractor is going to want to do so um the exact order again I need to talk to the engineer on what can be done about that my fear is is we've got these uh this stack of projects in storm season is approaching and there's someone more in need than someone else and I would prefer that I mean I think probably everyone if it's not a big like I said a huge financial burden to attack those lower lying areas first okay any other questions or comments on this no all right well uh Mr Roberts so I would like to point out uh based on what the marriage has said which is very accurate that we're not asking for the design to be completed by August the 15th right so the engineering firm the uh the timeline is we're expecting to have everything ready to advertise for bid by mid-august right so that it'll go out we're looking at five six weeks um to make sure we get a lot of submittals for that and then um you know tabulations um bringing it to the mean of first election I'm hoping construction starts uh late fall right and that's my point of bringing that up so by then the storm season theoretically is done right which would be great timing from a construction standpoint so that when they start the construction hopefully we won't have any hurricanes at that point so it'd be good what do you mean by late fall November because the last two years we've had two pretty good size storms in November the first two weeks it can happen yeah yeah and that the residents have spoke they had the perfect timing when they had their streets done because it was during the dry scene so I think November 15th anything before November 15th I think we're rolling the dice is the engineering firm going to be coming into any of these work sessions that we're having to discuss my intention to have them do at least one presentation for some q a thank you any other questions or comments Mr Roberts I'm not an insurance expert by any stretch but on the insurance from the engineering firm is there any way we could ask them about errors errors and omissions insurance to be included on the contract with them that they that they have that just in case we run across something where that would be beneficial to the city I can investigate it I I all the insurance was laid out in the actual RFQ agreement A continuing contract um but I can speak with Mr Morris colleague who I've been working with on that uh Rob thank you last call for questions or comments all right Patty Let's uh let's take this to a vote this is for authors authorization to execute a purchase order with Gemini engineering and Sciences Inc for storm water Master drainage plan bmps okay council member Banker yes councilmember Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Roberts aye council members Abel hi vice mayor Shirley aye AmeriGas hi and so uh it passes unanimously uh Mr Ricky you are authorized to execute that agreement thank you all right we're on to my favorite item tonight which is item number 15. uh this is for consideration of Merit pay increase for city clerk based on annual evaluation criteria this was placed on the agenda by city manager reefer Mr reefer thank you mayor um so I compiled all the uh evaluations that were filled out by the council members and did a tabulation of how the scoring uh turned out um I believe we had one that you know didn't have uh every category but I waited out to make sure that we average the the overall scoring um to act um to reflect what uh this country has received in our evaluations so I hope um in sending that to you it was easily understood if you have any questions please let me know I can answer for them all right before we go to the council let's go to the citizens for comments would anyone like to uh comment on this particular uh agenda item no all right back to the council but I'm going to need a motion on this one motion motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second wow all in favor of uh yeah no okay so uh I'm gonna give that one to Mike save sure all right uh Mr Banker do you have the floor well after you read that Proclamation which I applaud you uh I don't know five percent's enough but if that's the proposal in front of us I think she should get it thank you Mr Banker would anyone else like to comment no all right I uh I agree with Mr Banker I I think that it's well deserved and fully Justified um if there are no other comments from the council I'd like to go ahead and call the vote right all right Patty council member Banker yes council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro yes council member Robert aye council member stable aye vice mayor Shirley my mayor goddess hi and so it passes unanimously uh congratulations Miss Gentry and uh thank you for all you do thank you all very much mayor I I think I should have asked but that we discussed this last month what all the scores weren't in this was retro to her anniversary date I think that's what we discussed yes yes I think all right we're on to General business item number 16. do we have any general business to discuss okay we will move right along to council comments um since we're doing random orders and we're moving chairs around I have uh I've given the computer a rest this month and we're going to begin from my left uh to right and so we'll begin with Lloyd Roberts thank you Mr Mayor so I'm so happy that I got to move to this side now so that that worked out well it doesn't last I would like to uh thank our city manager for setting up a meeting with the Pinellas County um traffic Transportation division uh I think it went very well they came with two staff members from the county along with their traffic consultant that they've worked with before that we have worked with before uh So the plan is now the consultant is going to go back to the drawing board and gather more data since the last time that they did the study I think it's uh interesting that the first time they did the study was right around the infamous covet time so we all know that the traffic was significantly impacted by that so I think we'll get some very different numbers when they do the study again the County's picking up the tab for that so we don't have any expenditures for that and I think they're anticipating to come back what was the time frame Kyle approximately I thought they were telling us about three to four months okay so at that time we'll have a better idea of what some of the options are regarding what will impact the traffic on Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard as well to be able the goal is to just make it better it's never going to be perfect but I'm confident we can make it better and that's what we're taking a look at right now so just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on that just a little interesting side note I would have lost a lot of money on this bet we actually had conversations in the meeting about the various crosswalks that we have up here on Causeway Boulevard and Gulf Boulevard I would have bet all the money I have and all the money that Dave has that there were two crosswalks on the north and south side of Causeway Boulevard and there's not there's just one on the North side so my wife and I were walking the beach the other day and we had to cut up sooner than we normally do because of the uh higher water marks so there's not one on that side so that's going to factor in I think somewhat um Kyle with regards to what some of our options are to improve the Turning scenarios and the traffic situation there at the intersection of Causeway and Golf Boulevard so that's what we're looking forward to thank you thank you Mr Roberts all right let's uh let's move on to Leslie nataro not much okay well I'm gonna I'm gonna comment for you miss Notaro will be uh standing in for me at the mayor's Council this Friday uh because I I won't be able to to attend uh I have a prior engagement I'd say uh it's a charity event and they are uh they're actually doing a piece on my my deceased mother-in-law so uh I appreciate you filling in for me and uh I'm sure everyone will be happy to see you there all right uh let's move on to council member Livingstone Patty thank you for all that you do this is your week celebrate it thank you um we had a wonderful day on Wednesday thanking all of our committee members and it was such a great time so again Hattie I know you and some others put that together thank you but thank you to all of the committee members and the community when you volunteer it it really makes a big difference and we truly truly appreciate it some thank you Mr Livingstone all right now Frank Banker I'm going to try to be brief um at our last word session I was directed to contact former council member Mark about stepping off of the flood uh Mr Banker Could you um flood flood mitigation working group so I spoke to him and he didn't really want to step off but he's willing to come and speak to us at any time I notified the city manager you know he put me on it anyway but I've been working with Senator Scott who seems to be the only one that's really concerned and has any Pat compassion for uh what FEMA did to people that live on barrier islands and everything like that when they changed in October 2021 if you remember our former city manager gave a presentation on FEMA 2.0 I'm sorry I can't tell people can't hear you so since the beginning of last year I had residents come up to me and tell me geez my flood insurance doubled okay I have to drop it I don't want to take the words out of Senator Scott's mouth but he had a hard press meeting with the FEMA director I think it was December or November of last year and he says you're putting my constituents at the point right now should we get insurance because of other retirees that live in Florida or E you know that's that's the choices they're going to have on top of that our state legislation had an emergency session last year regarding citizens wind and Bill 2A actually now says your win policy must meet your flood policy so whatever your flood policy says your win policy has to meet it they also said anything any structure that's valued over seven hundred thousand dollars to replace they're not going to cover anymore so you're gonna have to go to the private Market to find coverage on that so it's just a total mess so I was able to get a three-way conversation from DC and the center of Scott's office here last Wednesday we went over all this and then I got another address Friday morning about a resident saying hey my flood insurance I I can't afford it it almost doubled again so I got into it I went into Assurance is one of the underwriters for the nfit and I said I cannot find the discounts that we're supposed to getting because if you look at 2.0 just the first page of 2.0 will tell you your elevation which is located most of us all have elevation certificates and if you don't you should get one it'll tell you your highest level and your lowest level then I think once section sales say discounts so I said it's given a 15 discount and the house is four feet above sea level so she says I think the 15 discount is because your city complied with all the regulations in 2021 which I said I think we spent over a million dollars to comply with that and that's all we're getting is a 15 discount she says well let me look at it she couldn't find an explanation of it so then when she started saying about the discounts of you know why isn't there because at one foot you should get 10 I think two foot you should get 20 percent and so on I said why isn't there discounts noted on that so she says I think the math formula is this and she says no that doesn't make sense so then she gave me a 400 page manual that FEMA came out with okay explaining discounts which she couldn't explain she then told me to contact FEMA which I did they gave me the nfip and I went right direct right to them they told me to go to the National flood what was it Insurance Agency gave me the toll-free number located in the Philippines it's just like this is a joke but it's costing us a fortune so after 20 minutes and I'm not trying to be disrespectful or anything explaining what I wanted from this person in the Philippines by the name of b um I asked to speak to the manager on hold for 15 minutes and got disconnected so I contacted the senator again this morning but this is this is a problem that a lot of people especially senior citizens on fixed incomes are saying I can't afford to insure my house anymore and and plus I'm not even going to get into homeowners insurance but I appreciate I'm trying I'm just trying to paraphrase all this I'm I'm looking at it I'm working on it I'm trying to come up with an answer it's a it's completely understandable uh your frustration uh I've sat in on on several meetings where they were trying to give us some sort of a formula and no one actually knows uh what what I can tell based upon what I've seen is that this is a an obscene wealth tax that they really can't tell you where the extra money is going to nor what it's for um I I think the goal is is to uh to hurt people and put them out of business so that those are uh foreclosed on or sold knocked down and then built up for something else what my main main concern should be everybody is if these insurance premiums go to and I'm talking 10 15 25 000 for typical home seven hundred thousand dollars you're not going to find people able to purchase a home and then the values are just going to go right in the toilet and that's with citizens that's not even with the nfip and and most of these private flood markets now want to bail on us so it's a mess and there is a clean formula in 2.0 but nobody wants to apply I've I've yeah to see or hear anyone actually explain it properly I I think it's just too complex 400 pages and they don't want you to know what that is any other comments Mr Banker I I appreciate all your research all right let's go to Mike's Abel yeah just thank you to councilman Baker for trying to get down to the bottom of that I really appreciate that but uh other than that I have no comments thank you very much Mr zabel all right let's go to vice mayor Shirley nothing further from me okay well I guess it's uh left to me uh first off I'd like to thank uh those who came out and had coffee with the mayor the other morning it was a nice meeting with you and uh and having some interesting conversations I'd also like to come in the Bel Air Beach Community Foundation for their hard work along with all uh who have volunteered to contribute or contributed to their efforts I'd also like to thank all those who currently serve on a committee or board in Bellaire Beach it's always safe to just sit at home and complain on social media but it gets very little done instead each of you have done something much braver requiring far more effort if you have donated your time money and talents to the city you call home on behalf of this Council and City staff I'd like to thank you all do I have a motion to adjourn Bush adjourn motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second second by vice mayor Shirley all in favor aye any opposed all right good night everyone"
