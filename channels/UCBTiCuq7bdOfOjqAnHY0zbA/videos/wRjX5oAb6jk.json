    "transcript": "all right i'd like to call to order the september 24th park and rec board meeting secretary nicole could you please call the roll sure tammy lavenda i'm here nora kodak not here george ortel i'm here nicole sessman i'm here um city staff lynn reeves here okay do i have a motion to approve the minutes from our august 19th um board meeting i have proof i'll second that i guess oh second and third that approval thank you okay very casual here yeah we are very casual and we would be more casual like i'm still reading off of this paper to get the verbiage right like i don't dig the verbiage but i do it because you want me to wow otherwise i just run the meetings the way i've always run my meetings in my past life but that's okay so we have no citizens here so no citizen comments so number four is q a with lynn reeves so um i got here a little early to do inventory real quick and so the two questions that i had for lynn and i'll just have him kind of go over it real quick was you know they did they've been having the budget meetings for the last several months and the final budget was just approved in this last meeting so we did get our budget approved for like our last year's budget or last like yeah was 6 000 but all the t-shirts and all the wearables came out of that budget so this year our budget is 4 000 but those won't be coming out of that budget so essentially we have the same budget that we did have so that's great um so does anybody have any questions about that or anything you want to ask or talk about i don't understand you sold two thousand dollars worth of stuff does that work no no so last year our budget was six thousand dollars but all the t-shirts like so like say every t-shirt order is 300 but all of that was coming out of our budget but it wasn't being put back into our budget as we were selling them so lynn and kyle were able to fix that where it doesn't come out of our budget initially and then it goes back into the budget that they're taking it out of so our budget is smaller but it's essentially still the same because we're still going to like take care of the wearables as far as like ordering and managing them it just won't be physically taken out of our parking lot it's okay did you just give blood i did did you eat a cookie because i don't want you ended up on the floor no i get a little easy afterwards but i feel like i'm fine i ran off the bus i'm like i have to go and they're like let me take out your needle no worries so hi how are you good so revision to the roll call nora is present and then what we were talking about is um so they did the final budget vote so our budget is um essentially i was explaining still the same it's 4 000 as opposed to 6 000 but none of the wearables will come out of our budget like they were this year so they were coming out of our budget but when we sold them they weren't going in so that was fixed but they reduced it but they reduced it but so it's essentially the same okay if not more just depending on how much we spent on wearables sure so so that's good um and that was really the only question i have because i didn't listen to the meeting for the budget that was very short it wasn't there should be a pile of them right yeah there is that them do you want to come back yeah thank you i have the ones i typed up so anyway so anything like in our past probably three or four meetings it always comes up especially when we're talking about like maybe the boat ramps or things that we've looked at and have suggested or things that we like have talked about you know and so those are the things that we can talk to lynn about today if you guys want to ask some questions go ahead take it away um on the docks can we have the uh kayak and entry exit what is it called launch launch thank you well here's here's what the situation is for the budget 7th street is going to get a new dock so that's why they're putting it in there and that makes sense and uh new the boat ramp is going to be fixed and the sea wall probably all at the same time we've got an engineer looking at that right now when the price comes back if there's any additional money in this fiscal year then we can look at some others but the plan right now kyle established the situation in the budget where we save money every year for the for the uh sure seawalls docks so we can start a process of either renovating them replacing them or adding something to them so we have to wait years for that but that little nest egg to fill before we can dip into it no no so how can i get a dock how can i get a launch on a dock what's the process i don't want to go into front of city hall and no we'd have to we'd have to look at what that would cost and if the dock we're talking about is in good enough shape to handle that addition because if it isn't then you would have to replace the dot to do that how do i get that ball rolling where do i go how do i start what do you mean what how do you what how do i get the doc looked at i can't call people out no no we will look at it that's something we'll just have i'll have the engineer that's i contact you and say hey can we have this looked at and you're talking about second street i'm assuming yeah yeah and you know if there's enough funding in the budget that doesn't mean we can't add it so contact you yeah okay or kyle i mean we can contact lynn but he'll just contact i'm just going to tell kyle well the engineer that's looking at the sea wall and docks his name's rude carson and he's done he did the engineering for the sea walls on harrison bridge and and so we're having a look at that one what's the other sea wall 16 16th street we're having him look at that one because there's an issue with the sea wall there and we're having look at actually possibly installing a sea wall along the front here where city hall is because the scouring is really getting mad there you know and even though there's rocks there it's scouring behind them and basically you're leaving voids behind the rocks so brown you look into that he's doing the seventh street one yeah same person so it might be easy just to get an estimate from him yeah we can we can ask him to look at the dog that's not a problem okay and then we'll see what it costs does he have to put a plan together to show you here's what it would look like for a boat line he has to do a yeah they have to do a drawing yeah and so he gives the estimate and then what happens then we put it out to bid and get prices and then if there's funding available then we can do something like that but if if as an example we've got is it 25 we've got 25 for the dock at 7th street i think you're what we i don't think is it wasn't quite that it wasn't quite that so there may be some money left from that uh we've got 50 for the boat ramp and the seawall we have a savings program for that throughout the city so i think there's like 90 000 in there don't quote me on exact numbers it's just in my head what i you know know but is seventh street being worked on right now no we have to uh we're waiting on the engineer to come back and give us a plan to to decide you know well the doc's gonna come out regardless actually did you he's yeah they're all the same they were built by the same company so if he does an upgrade plan to show what it would cost to do a uh boat not a boat launch but a paddleboard or a kayak lunch yeah it's just really it's just another step down yeah okay so lynn can i'm sorry go ahead and some of the docks have had that but unfortunately they've either deteriorated or somebody's running a boat into them or they've you know so they've broken off unfortunately that's not so let me ask you so like say um the engineer looks at 7th street um 2nd street and 16th street and 16th street is showing a bigger need because it's deteriorating or like it's ready to fall off would that take precedence over second street or somewhere like the request thing is little that's what okay what we're talking about at 16th street has nothing to do with the dock and that's gonna do with the seawall but that's not the same budget no it's too different okay perfect okay or two different areas and then would it help if there's been several people that have requested the same thing from second street would it help if there was more than like one household being vocal or is it just that we can pass on the information no you can pass on the information but you know it's it's good if more people send an email or something that you can document that you know if you've got other people that are interested because barbara mentioned it to me your neighbor and she might send an email yeah just tell them to send an email and the simplest thing to send it to is info at city of bellar beach that's the simplest easiest address to tell someone how's the seawall in the dock coming from two different budgets the way the the way the uh budgeting process and you you have different uh how do you call it different buckets sure so we have as an example we have street paving and we have curbs so it's like there's different uh accounts that the money comes from and that's how it's about it's not like one big lump sum of money now you know it if we don't use as much in as an example in the dock then that money that's left over we can use somewhere else for another dock so on seventh street you have a boat ramp and a dock and those are coming from two different budgets actually three what what yeah yeah because you have to program what you're doing that's the issue it's like a project it's in the it's in the same capital budget but it's as an example uh we're getting ready to do a stormwater project on 12th and 13th street but there's also a project in there for our 17th and 18th okay they're in the same budget but we have a line item for that specifically so but that's government accounting so all these things directed towards you and kyle yeah okay and then we will pass them on to the council but you know some things we can take care of if they're not such a great expense so will we get a chance to review the plans the maps or whatever before it's sent to council or well then go out to bid you're you're talking about what well you said someone who has to do a design plan for the applications to the to the docs if we want to upgrade them to for launch for uh paddleboard or kaya yeah when we when we do you know i can have kyle bring him to the meeting that's so good yeah that'd be great because we'd be able to take a look at him and see how it works and if you have any questions that's that's just the process of how government works we have to get a design first and then we 7th street's going to end up being a bid because of its multiple things it's a sea wall it's the boat ramp and it's the subwoofer so seventh street has not just been sitting there it's been working this whole time yeah it's not waiting for a new budget it's not waiting on anything we were we were waiting not for the boat ramp or the sea wall but for the dock yes we were waiting for a new budget because there was no money budgeted for a new dock in seventh street actually held up the project to wait for the new budget to roll around yeah really so that's how it works you have to put money save money in the end because you're putting it all together as one project yeah you'll say we'll save money in the beer but like you said you can you know when there's money there was no money left over from anywhere i guess well at the end you know right but there was no dot budget developed right but let's say we didn't need a dock all year you know now we have that little doc bucket of money and you can put that towards a sea wall that is not over no no no what no you have to put it towards the projects uh so like the what is that called the there's like a little egress or um sorry oh you know what it's there's like a walking easement there's a little way there was talk about paving that yeah and there still is there's still talk about that and who's talking about it the council's talked about it and they want me to start with uh 12th and 13th now there's no easement bucket there's no easement money where is that coming from it's coming from baby from paving it just kind of categorize it wherever and you're going to start at 12th and 13th you said that's what we're they're doing the design for that that's the first one they want to do to go backwards yeah why why is that one well it's heavier trafficked just heavier traffic no it's it it's it would what they wanted us to do finally they finally said yeah do this instead of put shell down or something else do it with a project that we have going on which we have a stormwater project for that street and that's why we're doing it with that but you're doing one street yeah and there's lots of streets with it wouldn't it make more sense financially to do all the streets at once rather than tack on one street with another project um if you had the money to do it all at once it's but it's much simpler to put it as part of the paving and you know it's it's a small strip what is it what are those long pounds two 300 feet maybe maybe less than that yeah so uh the overall cost could be very expensive because i think you did look into that didn't you put an asphalt down everywhere for the whole yeah and it was what was it um i was like 170 and yeah it was a lot so it's much simpler to do little pieces at a time because the city council's position was when we discussed it was you know we don't want to expend 170 000 on a path because there is some pushback about it there is some pushback i was just going to say that like people are fighting it they don't want it so i didn't know if that had anything to do with the section yeah there's there's some pushback on it people who lived there yeah i imagine well in some instant well we had one we he moved his fence but there's some people that have encroached into those setbacks into the eastmans yeah yeah you know so and we you know the big encouragement at this end of town anyway has been taken care of because he was in like a foot two or three like 15 inches they would be a lot like higher traffic if they were paved right i think i mean i don't think that other communities are definitely oh i don't think traffic within our community and that's what it you know if we're benefiting our people in our community yeah there's gonna be heavier traffic at second street when there's a kayak you know thing there but that's generally people are miller beach utilizing soil in their town the i think the fear from the residents in some areas is you pave it then more people will use it and that's creating and in a lot of cases it's not people that even live here unfortunately you mean use it and abuse it more so yeah yeah i mean we have a lot of people that walk the accesses to come here and play tennis from indian rocks beach you know it's where tammy lives that street there uh that's a problem area because of all the people that come out of indian rocks beach they run the stop signs they speed we put speed ups in to try to slow it down and it's helped but it's still a problem the speed homes helped a lot huh the speed bumps for humps helped a lot oh yeah yeah they reduced it but you know before those speed bumps were there it was like a race white line and they wouldn't even stop stop sign they still don't they pull over people well you see the reports they pull over people constantly at that first street and yeah we we try to send the deputies down there and it's unfortunately there's not really a good place for them to hide to catch those people that roll through the stop signs and you know it's what i saw down there mostly it's it's mostly residents that are stopped it's not the contractors that the residents were saying we're you know running the stop sign uh i'm talking indian rock indian rocks beach yeah i'm on second street so i i filled the traffic but i was here before the stop sign was even there at one point and it was yeah everyone came in but now i notice at brown park they take a left it's easier for them than to stop twice or take a left you know first street and go over this double speed hub so yeah we have the stop sign problem on 22nd street yeah and you put the police down there and guess who they're giving tickets so if we're hearing that people want something just direct it send you an email yeah you know kind of spirit i didn't get the call rolling can i ask because we kind of thought that like you know we talk about these things in our meeting and they are getting sent to you right so we've talked about the boat ramps over and over well that's why we've added right money to the budget right so it is like when we talk about things here they are getting the information and they are doing things but that was really why we had lynn come in to explain like with kyle the progress that's being made and you can do one officer wherever you can ask for whatever you want but i'm just saying like we are being heard for things that we discuss in our meetings um they are getting passed on yeah i look at your your minutes and everything so i know what you're talking about what's going on what's going on with our sign ordinance that just it's still on hold yeah all right yeah it's everything's uh a constitutional issue you can you can have a sign ordinance that's five or six pages long and it's fine or you can have one that's uh six foot tall and you know you can't protect against everything in life and that's the unfortunate situation well it was written pretty clear on there that i think like what three or six months after an election it's over gotta pull that bad boy in a lot of 2024 so any other major questions nicole no i'm good you don't have any questions no gee whiz i want the dog [Music] the existing knock to see if it's you know if it's not then the option will be we'll have to put it in the budget for the next but we're starting this that's an issue that who's already started saving money for docs because the biggest issues in the past were sea walls and uh of course the boat ramp so we've been saving uh 12 500 a year for the last three years for the boat ramp and now we're up to 50 000 so we should be able to get a fix for that yeah i don't necessarily want to wait until that dock is no longer a working condition just to replace it i feel like it can be like amended i feel like it could just be you know it's not magic but cut out on one end and then built on to the side even you know well if the pollings are okay that's fine but i'll give you an example 7th street that i was falling apart uh that was falling apart yeah underneath it and when we did the project there for the stormwater it became more evident you know because most people are looking at the dock you see uh composite decking and that's really all you see you don't see anything else as far as the inner workings of it you don't even think about the stuff that's going on underneath the water where it's all going on huh that's where it's all going on too yeah that that's where the deterioration happens is underneath and you you know you don't visibly see that until you're underneath it so uh we decided to put starkbook money away which is a good thing it's kind of like what we did with the beach accesses at the other end of town we saved money for them and then we got a 50 000 grant from the county so that paid for those four uh walkovers i don't know they've been to those new ones have you seen those they haven't even didn't even know about it are you talking about a little bridge going over like the sand kind of thing [Music] like the sand key one um 21st um howard down by harrison the marina and there's one in between about 25th about see i should see 21st and 25th when we do the beach cleanups right no no probably not that far oh so you're on the street because you actually what they are they're accesses from the sidewalk then i haven't seen any of them and then they go back through you know uh like at montmartre they go through actually go through the condo complex we had an easement there's a sidewalk that goes through and then there's a dune walkover out there well in most of the cases those were buried in sand and they're very old so we went to the county and asked for fifty thousand dollars and we matched up fifty because it was about a hundred thousand dollar prize that that just got finished what was the end of the year less than a year ago but next saturday at the beach clean up i'll have to go down to the 21st street one right there it's right on the other side of the hotel yeah it's right next to the motel international it has the bike it's not hooked up well they got all the flags out there i know but that's just all right is there anything else for lynn philly beach resort isn't it yeah resort hotel or motel or something like that uh okay now we're good and we're very timely we said 2 30 and we're done by 2 30. thank you very much thank you any time we'll see how hopefully you get a big turnout for sunday we have good weather i hope so are you gonna come yeah supposed to be like a dry cold front of course i don't know if i can come because that's what i said this morning because of why why did he sink he doesn't look hair anymore oh no okay if you guys need anything you know just tell kyle [Laughter] that's it doesn't matter i'm here all the time so and i i'm not i don't have any electrical shock things or anything in my office i'm so afraid of that okay thank you thank you they're pretty good okay so um is there i'm actually going to go out of order i'm going to make number um other business because then we're just going to go and we're going to go set up for sunday like tables and what we're setting up for today we're going to set up whatever we can the wedding tomorrow now we're going to put the tables on the back oh okay so we're going to do the tablecloths the signs so basically we don't have two or three hours of setup on sunday we're literally just going to do what we can scratch because we have we're supposed to do the day before we're gonna you know i don't know and then like like kind of do some like last minute like say for example i just wrote down your cute little suggestion box i have a pack of blank like um three by six index cards so i'm going to bring those so like we are going to kind of like walk through like what the display is going to look like for all the wearables i came in early and did the inventory i'm meeting with um so i did get business cards from the t-shirt people they put and they put more in the box so like if someone says oh well don't you have kid sizes you can go no but you can go three miles down the road and go have one made or if you know they want that pink t-shirt in yellow instead you know we just they can take these cards and they know because i guess for years and years and years this place didn't have any bellar beach anything that's what some of the residents that have been here forever told they're like i've been in there 20 times they never had anything better beach so you know we obviously want them to buy what we have here and it's actually less expensive than what they're gonna pay down there but um if there's a one-off we're not having people go oh can you get this and you can you get this because we can't fill like individual like one-off orders so we have that pile of business cards um john from sunsets by brush is supposed to be here any time to drop off like maybe a sign or some business cards to advertise the november painting class on the beach tara is tara's gonna drop off some more business cards and then jessica for the stand up paddleboard so we're gonna put her a little easel just like more things we can put on the community table because i haven't had a lot of people call me and say hey i want to put stuff on there um but like anybody that's called me about this didn't read the invite they're like is there gonna be food there is there gonna be drinks there do i need to bring a blanket i mean they literally didn't read the invite so i was just like yeah no that's what it is it's just the music you've got to bring your own chairs pack a little picnic basket um there's going to be water and italian ice that you can get but otherwise you know it's kind of like bring your own deal it's just kind of a relaxing sit outside someone did ask me if they could bring an umbrella and i thought that was cute and i said sure you can't yeah just like the beach cleanup guy were they um residents you know yes okay cool yeah yeah good but even if they aren't is the mayor so we can have guests and they can be invited for residents too oh you know absolutely i'm just um in general this is like people that live on my block or like a few blocks about just like signs or something or they got the invite you know it's the details it's like you know they saw the date and they saw what it is but they didn't read like all and i'm thinking that's why no one called me for the community table like no one even got to that so i don't know if there was too much verbage on there but like you know how do you let people know so maybe people will just see it and then it will become a thing at the next one and speaking of the next one so kyle and i talked about this so we put our initial parade route together for the halloween parade and if you drive down fully yeah yeah i mean there's like it's blocked off there's a big huge thing so we're saying little prayers that it's going to be done before october 30th which is just a good sign that they're out there because they could have said that's true so i guess just in the back of our minds you know like obviously hope for the best prepare for the worst like if they're still out there working and it's still like blocked off and there's a hole in the street we have to rethink our parade route because we can't go around in a circle so um like kyle excuse me kind of suggested that maybe we just kind of go to it and it would be really hard you could also do a real short if you just went down see her because we have an easement from the end of cedar to our stormwater ponds you have to walk through the grass a little bit but if it's dry okay yeah oh we can look at that hopefully it'll be done and we can just stick to the original the original circle but um if anything like we could just do the big loop around the big yeah parking lot and then i mean worse comfortable i mean i always thought your route was pretty big but did you okay um so anyway just hopefully it works out and we're fine with that and all that good stuff and then i will or if anybody has anything i'm just gonna google it and find something like um what the judges use to like rate people and it's not gonna be real complicated but it's gotta have a little bit of substance i think as far as like what they're voting for and then if we have six judges we add them all up and then that's who wins and then we really haven't talked about who's gonna be like the mc um is anybody interested in doing that i know you can't even gonna be there but your husband might anyway we can talk about that too if anybody has any ideas i was thinking we could put jules chandler in charge of that but um she also wants to be a judge so like we'll figure that out later but if you have anybody if you know anybody or if you are interested in doing it just say hey i'd like to emcee and announce all the winners i'd be fine with that so you're all like tricky tricking down another chair looking the other way it's like the teacher when you don't know the answer and you don't want to call them no i don't think i don't think it will be but we'll see keep it simple yeah yeah definitely keep it simple um but i will come up with some kind of form and i'll bring it to our october meeting to make sure you guys okay or if you have any input i mean obviously i'm just going to type it up on a word document and print it out it's going to be simple we can make changes if we need to um so recruiting new members or help for events i think we kind of talked about like what we wanted to do as far as like who wanted to do what for um this sunday and if i'm perfectly happy with leaving it with what you guys requested so um my son is going to be here he is going to empty like the garbage and the recycle bins like into the big dumpster if they need to be and he's going to do it for the whole three hours and then nicole is going to do the merchandise table and initially said you're you're good for the whole time are you still good for that okay and then um nora you're gonna do the water and the um first aid table for the first shift and then george is gonna take the second shift is that still accurate george depending on it yeah i think that work okay do you want to do something else instead no i'm just trying to plan i think i think i can do that okay and they'll be i'm gonna bring a chair for that station so it's like yeah i'll bring a chair but my wife's in a wheelchair so i have to coordinate getting hurt to a spot and then getting me to inspire my chair so okay that's it okay well and then i mean i'll like we're going to be there we're going to have other help so if like if you if you just want to stay with your wife it's totally fine that's totally fine if you don't want to sit at that table for an hour and a half you don't have to what if i want to sit at the table but that was my wife since your second shift you have an hour and a half to find your cow for your wife before you have to go to the table okay so you have plenty of time like if you were a first shift i could see but i think you should be good like have time to set her up and then and be there and i'm gonna be a floater so it's like i'm gonna be working all the tables and like kind of directing people and if like say you have to go to the bathroom then i'll take over for you and if you have to go where's the comment box where's the community table where's well we put together a diagram that we had to present to them so we're going to lay it out exactly the way we submitted it it's got to be spot on yeah yeah so like just to recap so like the band is gonna be okay like so we're here the band is gonna be in this corner of that back patio the merchandise is gonna be on the other end and so and then we're gonna put the sign up hanging to read out and then we're gonna do like um kind of like a cute little like um clothes hanger line but not a clothesline and then clip so we have examples of of the shirts that are clipped too and then we're going to have like signs on either side how much are the license plates are they 10 petty said they used to be 10 but she didn't know i was in texas that's how it asks is patty oh yeah she's like that's what you used to sell for ten but i don't know that yeah i would say ten we'll do ten i got five now in my office but you always get more here yeah if need be if they start selling i don't know how they're gonna sell okay oh so you'll be here just in case we need to be super back up just in case like the cash draw overflows you need more cash oh no it's going to overflow i don't know all that's done problem okay no that's perfect and he um and koozies do you remember how much koozies are are they three and stickers three i think they ended up just under so both one was 250 and one was 333 so i think we did the average of three bucks on both yeah i don't look um say three dollars stickers aren't on her sign but i mean would we sell the four dollars the little ones that's so expensive i think i think we're going through three and three okay so that's one right okay and then we decided on so it's like all the t-shirts and tanks and then we did pick up the new order um two colors of new ones for men's two colors of new ones for women's the women's we did like a round neck t-shirt as opposed to a tank top and then the men's we just did t-shirts and we did them some of them in smaller sizes because their t-shirts seem to run really big and so like the extra larges are just like so we did like just we kind of sized them down a little bit so there were different options so t-shirts and tanks are 10 hats are 15. um they had light blue hats that george won't wear and um then they have we have 12 gray hats in um that look just like this except for their gray how much are the hats um the hats are 15. did we get the towels the towels are 15. we're going to lower them from 16 to 15 to make it easier for you as far as change there you go nora do you have a bell or beach tank top to wear i have a black one in a small but this pink one is a medium i look for the small before i i drip dry these just so they don't shrink do you want to take this and then i'll look for the black one for you sure so you don't have to buy one oh i don't wanna buy one it's up to you i mean i don't care like i have like five so if you don't want to buy one no i know i'm happy to buy one because that might be too big for you okay and there's yeah and then don't forget your name tags the lanyards with your name tag what am i wearing with my shorts shorts yeah your little jazzy dress there goes that well that's the other thing too because i was thinking about wearing a cute little dress too but i'm gonna be hot all the ladies will have the same amount and i'll be left out with black well that's where your sister wears a hat george yeah plus you'll have shade on your head she's making comments about my head now wow shade on your head we all do um towels 15 license plates 10 koozies three stickers three and the merch is i'll probably see it the tanks and the t-shirts are the same price yeah and what is that ten okay i'm just trying to memorize i'm sorry i'm going to do my life 10 10 3 the times and hats and everything with patty um their new ones are in kyle's office and then the original orders are kind of like if you go around behind laura in that room um and i did an inventory before like this meeting and so like we sold four so i'm going to give her like i have an excellent get into the stuff in my office i just figured that you didn't sell anything oh you did oh nice no okay i'll we'll look at it afterwards different order versus what's behind them colors and designs yeah so like um in the back room all we have for women are pink tank tops and there's pink and purple t-shirts and then on the new order the um women's t-shirts are yellow and um a different shade of hot pink and then the men's same print though no they're different okay and then in the men's in the original order we had some gray it was pretty much this color gray and some navy blue and the new t-shirts were seafoam green and light blue so and then there's light blue hats and gray hats yeah i didn't even inventory anything in your office because i didn't know so yeah we'll get so i have this yeah after this when we put everything together we can kind of just arrange everything okay perfect um i have like a bin in my car if we want to put the merchandise in that yeah like the extra so that it's like closed and then if someone's like oh i need size whatever i can just grab it out of the bin yeah and i haven't been too so we'll have a bin for like the t-shirts and tank tops and then a bin for the towels and then so they're not in cardboard boxes yeah and then we have lids in case it starts to rain or whatever and then like the extra stuff if it just like doesn't blow away or whatever like the um koozies and stuff so yeah okay so and then what i'll do is i'll combine like the inventory that i took from the original merchandise orders and then the new stuff and then i'll have a spreadsheet so every time you sell something you just make a little hashtag and then you just kind of keep track of how many you sell and then we'll just match it up with the money and okay turn it into kyle so and i'll just give it to you on is that cool yeah and then kyle's got the two um eight by ten like acrylic stands so we're gonna i'm just gonna yeah no pictures or anything like that so just the pricing that i read too t-shirts hats um whatever boom big print one on each side of the table and then maybe have a couple of examples out and a couple hanging and then you can just pull from the inventory like either underneath or back behind you on that bench okay and that should be pretty simple i mean and you do this way more than me so i mean obviously anything you need to do to make it smoother for you or where is the like clothesline thing going to be on the outside well what i was thinking was we could hang a couple t-shirts on the line on either side of the sign and then that's what we have to figure that's facing the lawn yes okay because that doesn't say i have like the little tags i could just write the price on what they are and stick it with the clothes pin like on it so they're not like coming up how much is that even though it's on the acrylic thing they're not gonna look but if they're facing it's like oh okay like the shirts only ten dollars like let me grab the money and then they come up to the table sure yeah whatever you want to do and then i thought either we could we that's what we have to see today like the easiest way to either hang them behind you or on the building wall i mean we're going to try it like i brought some jute which i don't think is going to be heavy enough to hang them on we might need some more cord like you have for the signs yeah and i was hoping yeah perfect so we'll probably use that and then just make sure that there's room to clip these should be fine yeah perfect and these are heavy duty so they should be okay if there's anything we need to get last night if we decide today okay yeah if not i have like safety pins at home okay like smalling and he got big safety pins for the signs on the table oh sweet okay yeah we'll figure it out not a big deal okay so we're good with that and then how many volunteers do we have like a good amount or well so this is the thing like deb and um anthony volunteered but then her mother-in-law passed away and they're in new york so i don't know if they're gonna be back in time and then like laura said she would volunteer but she's supposed to be here now for the second time in a row and she's not here so like i kind of take volunteers with like i guess but like as far as like what we need shift-wise i don't know what we need volunteers for like this is not like the next one we definitely need help we need at least 10 volunteers this one we don't need a lot of people um because like you guys like you have your shifts and then like i will be around too like if like i said if you want to take 20 minutes off and go sit and eat dinner or whatever i'll take your place or you know kyle can walk around make sure you have ice or if you what we decide as opposed to getting like six big coolers or whatever we're only gonna have like three and we're just gonna keep refilling them so he might help with that i could help with that my son could help with that like it's i don't really think he's going to be emptying you know garbage every five minutes so he can be the shepherd i don't think of the last one we emptied garbage right at the end yeah you're not going to fall we're not going to get that much going yeah just not people kind of keep a hold of it next to the italian nice i'm so excited yeah also that i mean we're in our water bottles and we can fit all the water bottles that we have and come up with big carts for recycles so cool um they trimmed everything up out there they yeah it looks nice all the surrounding garbage cans everything in the area is fresh yeah it looked nice when they drove by twos i could tell that they touched it up so that's perfect thank you um [Music] anything we do out there today as far as preparations for sunday it are going to be hi all the changes will be out there tomorrow and the park's open tomorrow no we're not doing anything out there we're doing everything and we're leaving it come on in laura how are you hi hello hi this is laura french hi um i'm kyle i work for the city nice to meet you i haven't seen you all before yeah she's another northsider george yeah it's good to have a north center he's like i'm here with all these soft weird southsiders i think you'll are making that up it's not a big enough town for there to be a north and the south side that's what i thought but he brought it to my attention i'm like who knew anyway so we were just kind of going through details for um sunday and kind of laying out so we like laid out the um we laid out like the work schedule and i know you want to help on sunday so like we really have like three stations and then kyle and i are floaters so like you might be able to just sit and enjoy yourself okay um but as far as like um but like maybe if george wants to go sit with his bride you could take over the water and the um first aid table for a little bit yeah i'll tell you you said that she certainly would like that tell her listen to the tape [Laughter] tell her it'll be posted online a bunch of giggling ladies in the background exactly um so [Music] anyway so we have ice we have water bottles we have the koozies that we're giving away um so this was a thought that i had like say for example like we don't have anything saying you know it says hydration station but it doesn't say like the water is free or whatever but we want to make sure that we give the bellar beach jacuzzis that we have made that we are that are complimentary to the residents out to people so that's another thing that like maybe you and i could be doing as we're walking around if people aren't coming to the table because they brought their own cooler of wine we're going to walk around and hand out cold water bottles in the bellar beach coozies and say thank you for coming because it's supposed to be kind of like a mingle and a meet and greet anyway and so just saying hey so that's like something you and i could do so we have a south side or a north side but that's something that we could do how many do we have to give away we have a hundred okay yeah how many do we expect will be coming okay no idea so i did do like the community table and nobody called me so i mean what we're going to put like i'm going to put my stuff on there nicole's going to put her stuff i'm going to call um they called you to do what to put their business cards or something they just had to bring it and drop it off i don't know but it said it call me so i had like a sign-up sheet and no one called me oh i assumed see and you've been in all the meetings so she assumed she would not read her invite just assumed i thought it was like call me if you have any questions i like what you can and can't do see and that's the thing that is welcome that's totally fine and so what i did is i did a sign up sheet that i'm going to put on another clipboard on the table and then it's going to say like so it says like my name my address and what my business is and people can just come up and write it in hey you know so that way we kind of keep track and then we kind of know what's on there and like i mentioned earlier we're going to have the november sunsets by brush the painting class john is going to pass out some tchotchkes so people know about that in case they don't see it on the website stand up paddle board is going to pass you know they have a sign and uh easel um nor uh what's her name tara yoga has like you know she's gonna do the same thing with either sign and business cards so more people can see that too so it's not really a bell or beach business but i think it's things bellar beach are offering its residents so yeah we'll have at least six to ten things on the table it won't look completely desolate like unless until people come and drop stuff off and i'm hoping that they will like i didn't even think of that i just i didn't know so i'm hoping they do drop off stuff is someone manning the table or is it just going to be um well the way we have it set up is it's just it's kind of like a silent sales person because there's no soliciting here but if you wanted to stay like if tara wants to stand there and answer questions about her yoga that's i told her she could totally do that yeah it's not you don't have to but she can't because people do have a lot of questions about how hard it is like if they have an injury like you know what kind of yoga what do you bring that's different because it's a city sponsored program that we do exactly here are we gonna put a sign up sheet um for this committee on that table so people come by and they want to sign up and join the committee that's a good idea there's a suggestion box um we can yeah we can figure out something to put that that's there it's always on online but people don't see that all the time so yeah that's a good idea we can do that okay um let's see hi and is that the same table where the um inventory will be sold no so yeah i think he walked in afterwards so like the setup we had to like present a schematic to the board to approve so like if you are staring at you know the back behind outside so the band's going to be at one end of the patio underneath the what um what do you call that pergola okay i keep calling it a gondola that's italy tammy so oh and then at the other end is the merchandise table so it's like she's kind of in that she's gonna man the merchandise table the whole time so there'll be a sign hanging going out and we're gonna do like a cute little like where we you know put up some pricing and we're gonna hang up some examples of like the tank tops and t-shirts and we have our inventory um like maybe hang up a beach towel and then she's gonna arrange it all so it's like you know pretty accessible for her and so her table she's got a great eye for that you're the perfect person she's like this is easy breezy i do this all the time and then like so if you're coming into the cul-de-sac so it's like the italian ice people will be kind of right in front of that little building right there is that that's not the what is that building is that just like the frontier building the frontier building so like they'll be right around there and then like um the hydration station and the um first aid will be there and then the community table will be on the other side so it's just kind of like a like obviously leave the sidewalk open so people can cut through it'll just kind of be along the edges on the concrete around the inside of the roundabout because no there's no cars that are going to be able to come back there once the band and everybody um unloads so like you know the circle the big circle i mean we're not going to block it off with like horses or anything like that but no one can drive back back there do you want to put some come with that oh we might want some yeah i just because there is a couple parking places yeah yeah cause they'll park all the way up the last spot of the year and then we can just come into you know yeah that's perfect if we can get a couple cones across that and then just like maybe leave a walkway so people know that they can't pull up there and then i haven't been out to that space yet to look around is it pretty shaded or a little there's some trees and um there's some shade in the park and there's a little bit of shade down by the beach but you can bring an umbrella to stick like either clip it onto your chair or like you know if you want to sit in the grass and you can bring umbrellas back there it's allowed yeah yeah for sure i didn't put that on the postcard but you're right i feel like i have a million umbrellas but i'm not sure about that so i might just bring a couple and just set them up i really have like a million chairs from softball days um that are like collapsible chairs so i can probably just bring are you going to bring your lemon tent i can yes she's a cute little lemon i think of it as lemon cello but she's a cute little lemon tint i have someone with gelatin i think it's in the freezer all right yeah she's going through a lot of reconstruction yeah um okay what time should we be there to help with the setup um okay so the band is gonna be here at 3 30 so i thought maybe three o'clock 3 15 because if all goes well literally all we're gonna have to do is take up the tables that are already set up with the tablecloths and the signs on them and pop them out there and kyle had a great idea because he said the wedding that's there tomorrow isn't like they're not doing a lot that has to be undone and it's not supposed to rain but people are still able to come through and go to the bathroom so he's going to leave some tables and chairs set up in case people are hot or if they're overheated i'm assuming they can come in and sit down and cool off because the doors between the merchandise table and the band will be open and that's another way like people will have to go to the bathroom they'll see the merchandise even if they don't you know see the signs or the pricing or whatever they're going to be kind of going that way to go inside yeah i think i told the ice people like four because they don't have anything to set up and that's fine besides like maybe they're like sign things but they stick in the ground but so do does everybody think 3 15 3 30 is good you'll be at three i'll be here at three yeah i can get here whatever time it's you're gonna i mean your table is gonna have the most set up because we're talking about yeah yeah i could be here at three and i can totally help you with anything you need help with that um so we'll have the i'll bring the coolers on sunday kyle's going to have all the ice and water we're going to have the science and deck already done you said we've already got the garbage cans and the recycle cans ready we've got the giveaways ready is there anything that anybody else can think of [Music] okay cool well then we'll just go try to set up some i might print some restrooms up this way signs just put on those doors and things yeah that'd be great okay last time i came a little early like that and helped set up but then i didn't bring my wife so i went when we were done setting up i went back and got her um so i might have to do something like that that's fine because you're on second shift you don't have to come set up you don't have no but i do have to come to get a handicap parking place out there last time we put a cone by yeah no that's good okay are we gonna go over the other regular meeting things or we well i kind of did the other business first so recruiting new members that's a great idea to put it on the table and then i have the beach cleanup is next saturday so it'll be posted nicole posted again i think moving forward because like last month you know we had somebody respond and say oh i'll bring my whole company and there was like 10 of them but they didn't show so we had way too many donuts so i think what we're gonna do is we're always gonna go with a solid three six packs and then if like 50 people show up i'm literally gonna take account when i give them the gloves because a lot of the adults are like no i don't want a donut no i don't want a donut so it's like you don't want to like not have enough um so like i will literally run over the bridge and get a six pack if i have to like when people are out cleaning it's i mean i don't know like what do you think i mean is it better to just have too many and give them away the way they do it at church is first come first serve whoever makes it to that gym first gets the donuts that's true i mean everybody drinks the water no but we have a cleaning station yeah let's just try to do our best like we've been i guess and yeah okay uh it's actually so she had to run to publix it with like no notice the poor girl and i was like i might i literally had the receipt that they were paid for and there was nobody there making donuts and i was freaking out it was like 7 15 7 30 in the morning i was like oh i know so yeah no and you know what publix is so much cheaper and the donuts were better better and i ate both that's fine i like public stuff it's better i ate both kinds of donuts in the public service were definitely better definitely more gourmet that's all you eat yeah so but i will tell you the donuts were actually better when she picked them up last minute than when you paid cause they gave us old donuts oh my gosh and they gave us they gave us they gave us the big boxes which like i have these bags you know those hot green hot cold bags that you can put ice in because that's the only way i can keep the donuts from melting and like while we're picking up garbage i'll try yeah it's easier to do three or like all um six packs not 12 packs because those big boxes don't fit in my they don't fit in the cooler um so yeah that's why we don't go to that dunk of donuts anymore because literally i want to say for a dozen donuts it was ten dollars more at sand key than it was publix and they weren't as good um okay cooler's eye signs everybody's been confirmed just meaning the band and the ice vendor and kyle ordered everything that we need and so the deputies are confirmed on here okay so i asked patty about that when you were in okay well she said that like they just post it and they get a volunteer so she doesn't know who it's going to be oh i heard from glenn if um it's going to be a normal deputy they're just extending their shifts on each end oh okay sorry people were if we have not enough parking here and people need to spill over onto the streets is there an option for that well we have 70 parking places and then we're hoping that people will like if they're like if they live on history that they walk and they don't park unless they they can't you know obviously that's a different situation but if they can park like i was going to even ask these two if you guys wanted to carpool like yeah i was just going to get dropped off so i was like and then hit your ride home or walk yeah and i can give you a ride home but yeah so it's like we're just we're trying to like have the least but we have 70 um i don't know we kind of encourage people to like either uber or be dropped off all those fonts is pretty good yeah yeah yeah people are gonna come out and sell them things at least we need people for car that's pretty good yeah okay and then i did ask kyle because you know it's obviously public parking they can pay to go to the beach but he said last sunday after four o'clock there wasn't a single car of people paying or playing tennis or anything so it's it's not like we had to close the parking lot because other people were parking so we have this parking lot and then we have the one on 12th street so that would be the other thing they could go to 12. okay um and walk across the street okay so that's where the deputy would probably direct them over there if if god forbid he had to put condoms and say the lot is full you have that many people yeah that'd be good because at that point it would be residents that could walk over there yeah and um do we think that the vote race that they're just having is going to do anything to impact us the boat race like what time is it sunday that late um i thought something was sad that it was until four o'clock on um sunday then sunday is like the better day so i just wasn't sure from a traffic standpoint if there was going to be any competitiveness yeah okay okay shouldn't be like the outback pole type traffic okay and kind of if you're here for the whole thing that should be cleared up by then if it's still four o'clock i think so then it should be cleared up by the time our event is over um okay but yeah i'm not sure where the ban oh the band i saw them in turban springs but i don't know where they're coming from us north siders might have a little issue we are a little more impacted you are trafficking every time i come over the bridge i'm like i had no idea i'm glad i don't have to turn right you should try to get out of 20th street onto ball but you can't do it you just gotta throw that old gun yeah maybe that's how your battery is tight maybe that's how your battery died you were he told the story before you guys got here he was like last week he's like my phone battery died my car battery died he's like oh my batteries are tied [Music] oh and the last thing is like we need to like um we can only eye it because we can't put anything up or the decorations so we're going to open everything up and probably leave them on this table and then you know it really doesn't matter they're just going to hang them by strings from in between the two posts um high enough so you know you're not hitting your head on them which would never be me but if you're six foot you might hit your head but you know just so they're higher but they just look cute and that's really gonna be it we're not doing something you want me to try and hang before or are we gonna have enough time hang before what three o'clock yeah well i was just thinking that's something we would be doing at three because we have an hour and a half all of us we should be able to all we have to do is put out some tickets i think we do as long as we have a plan and everything else is set up and we kind of work through like because i think our biggest things are going to be like making sure that the signs are up and we have like a way to hang things that we need to hang and otherwise it's real easy we just have to pop the tables down and put the stuff on them okay it should be and we're going to have the ice and the coolers in the water i mean and the water is going to be cold right you're going to put them in the water you got right now 120 in the fridge yeah so that's another like 75 on deck so okay yeah we should be good okay um next meeting all right i guess i should do that yeah even though we're not leaving okay so the next meeting um wednesday october 13th three o'clock did we move it from two to three or were we always at three and i'm just confused we were always at three you're at three thirty and then three three yeah two is just special to me yeah there's more stuff to do we don't want to do two i could do two george can you do two i'm looking uh i'm trying to find the calendar all right we are talking about october 13th it's wednesday until we're done nicole are you going to yeah kyle yeah i think two is probably better for you right yeah i mean anytime okay it's okay with you sure okay so yeah we'll move it to two thank you no worries okay and then um george would you like to make a motion to adjourn the meeting sure i make a motion are we going out we are but she wanted to just finish off this whole meeting and we're going to adjourn the official meetings because yeah we're not going to come back in here to do the journey and make a motion that we adjourn our meeting and i second it all in favor okay"
