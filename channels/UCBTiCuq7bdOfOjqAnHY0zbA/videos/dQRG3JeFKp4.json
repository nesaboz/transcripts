remember to correct all your questions and comments to the council many council members would like to respond assists and comments please hold your responses until we reach Council comments at the city manager or City attorney would like to address citizens comments please hold your responses until your designated report time would any citizens like to be yes sir things come up to the podium give us your name and address and uh and try to stand hi I'm Mike Kelly 2740 hibiscus Drive West I know it's not on the agenda tonight so I wanted to come up at citizens Commons and expressed at the council that I'm in full support of a city managers campaign to go ahead and consider purchasing a boat I know that he's got good intentions for the purpose of which this vote to use especially for his Public Works projects your Pro other objects that give the problem give us give us problems that the boat would would definitely help one of which and in 2003 we had our own police boat here and they actually did a lot of Maintenance of all things over the movies the buoys and Barnacles all the time they get heavy they start to sink and we actually had our police in our Public Works departments at that time going around maintaining the inside and the outside Louise so I just well I wish well wish God well moving forward on it and you've got my support if you need help thank you thank you Mr Kelly with any other citizens like to speak on this topic or any other topic okay do we have any citizens on the oh yes sir John Hanson 22nd Street I'm kind of a little on this one I've read all day feedback on the next door pluses and minuses I think there's good in it yes but the one underlying concern I have is the sea walls for private property I don't understand unless it's in the code that is the city's responsibility to inspect them if that's private property why is the city having to inspect it I give back the boys um the outflows and that sort of stuff and took maybe a lesser degree um traffic enforcement on weekends or whatever but I see the the sea walls on these properties waterfront properties and being personal property they should be responsible for it so I'm kind of in the middle right now but an account is still leaning towards yeah it might be a good idea but we just maybe need to do a little more research I'd like to get a little more feedback about them to see what expression aspect thank you thank you Mr Hanson we have anyone else in the audience before I call them promote them yes sir please Drive West as we return to what Mr Hampton just said uh yeah it's kind of interesting I heard about the boat I initially thought it's a ridiculous idea but it has in everything I started looking into it doing my own research listening to the city manager I think that's my focus to stand out today is to support the city manager right I trust what he's doing I trust that as a city manager he feels this is long term this is something that will help in the staff I don't think it's fiscally irresponsible which I think we need to step back sometimes and look at what do we do overall we're pretty smart right now we're pretty smart with what we're making decisions on so I trust that piece just to help with the argument on both sides I'll give you just a couple pieces of data um first of all did you know actually I wasn't even surprised that's our history that's like probably speaking that we used to have a boat and it did more than police it when we have the police department so that's a nice president other cities Clearwater Dunedin um even with Daryl sometimes we compare ourselves to them they have Arenas or municipalities it's uh it's nothing tied to some of the information I've seen fly around they have skips they do a lot of Maintenance I think if if I were the city manager you might want to step back and just revise some of your comments and this is something you really feel we need revised some of the comments and the use the case scenarios for the citizens I think I wanted Mr hands in the prom is not what I originally thought you were wanting to vote for was City inspections of sea laws which they don't think it is we do have code everyone should review it um I'm starting to see things around divers and boats and inspecting cracks and I just know that that's not your intent um I'll add that if you did land a boat for two times a month and in five years you just spent the amount of money on rentals that you would for what you're asking for which I think is around 80 to 85 000 but you put something higher in a budget can you always be better on research on What boat yes um just looking at that expenditure it justifies itself so I could go through this information I see flying around the city uh 90 of it seems to be addressed towards fear bad decision making liability a lot of legit let's take this terminology so maybe address the sea wall specific I think even without the seawall application you can justify this take our Pilots did you know that not scraping the oysters off you lose yield on the pilings themselves I didn't even know we had ownership of an island that you brought up that we should be maintaining so just to clear up some confusion maybe address that one that seems to be highlighted other than that there's a lot of misinformation in here just because we're we're still the best we're over the three minutes thank you I appreciate it thank you I support your decision we have another red all right in that case let's close a public Comics here and let's go to remote is there anyone that would like to speak remotely yes hello yes okay please give us your name and your address please Roger and Deborah 115 Causeway Boulevard and Roger you're going to give you three minutes in case I run over yes okay please go right in um I want to voice our opinion on the purchasing of 100 000 Post in the July 24th minutes from the city council work session the following reasons were stated to purchase a vote first of all to check storm water out Falls once a month a boy a boat with negate the need to get permission from private property owner to check these powerballs how many of these outfalls are actually on private property we've been here over 20 years and we've not heard that this is a significant problem if it is maybe it would be cheaper to rent a boat for a day a month to check the outposts that we can't get access to and I've actually talked to one of the rental boat companies and I I don't believe that we would it would [Applause] [Music] maintenance from the past meetings over the years we've never employed a person qualified to set degrees so I don't understand how we could have a person who would be qualified on staff to maintain them uh if you've ever swam out to the buoys you guys even know that the water is not clear out there and checking on them would require scuba or dive gear so does our insurance cover our employees to do this type of work uh you've heard people speak about the sea walls I do not believe we should ever get in that business I think it exposes us to problems with our citizens liabilities and other things we have other options available we can require homeowners to provide their own inspections on an annual basis and get a forget to have their Seawall as far as the South Island monitoring those we've lived here again over 20 years but it's never been a big issue our current vote can monitor and maybe we can put together a volunteer group as we do for the bridge and the beach remember we don't own the bridge and we don't own a good portion of the beach where we pick up trash and things so it would our Island should really take precedent with our own volunteer groups as far as another issue was objects in the water and underground debris our residents pay taxes that cover the Pinellas County Sheriff's boats and Coast Guard to handle this do we have anyone qualify on staff to remove underground degree most responsible voters will remove small objects from the water when they can and that they're too big then we do have agencies we can call a dead fish again our residents pay taxes and the county contracts out for this why should we double tax our residents to perform this task I realized that the smell effects Waterfront owners probably more than none of Waterford but they were positives and negatives to living on the water another issue that was listed was darably professors we cannot go aboard these buses it's trespassing and it can be dangerous again we pay taxes for the shares and the coast guards to handle daily lessons these minutes state that we would have two routine bi-weekly patrols plus maintenance issues and projects our Colonel Public Works staff is very overworked who's going to conduct two bi-weekly controls I assume it would need to hire a vote captain or at least on additional qualified person to do that would be a considerable respect at least minutes the pros and cons of running a boat were reviewed yet only cons were stated those cons were timely accessibility to a rental boat having a suitable model of above available that we've required and liability there was no mention of the pros of renting a vote such as no maintenance costs when you rent a boat with no insurance costs when you rent a boat and no budget item replacement costs when went to the boat liability is an issue with ivank whether we rent or own a boat however I would guess our reliability was higher for one minute I believe that because it is the council's job to provide our citizens with complete information and I think you dropped the call also I found the statistics that taxable values and conservative cost presented at that meeting extremely wise first to not include the condos in the statistics is skewing the data condo owners are part of our city and deserve to be included in all data to compare Harbor front property with our spinny Springs is a faulty analogy regardless of whether you live on the water you must use our streets to get to your house and to get in and out of the city so there's no relevance in comparing city streets to Harper flag poverty we have to maintain our city space for all citizens for the record another computer service made to spending fifty thousand dollars on a track here at Lake Worth Beach I'm actually not for this another Point according to who our city managers data we had 1.1 miles of beach in our city to spend fifty thousand dollars to rate four or five times a year is crazy again you could hire it out or do nothing we actually break more Bel Air Silver Beach than a Long Beach and most of that is private property do we get permission from each homeowner to access their property related and if we do black we collected food from them I'm also against the term when the changes on there as book codes we test tournaments a while back per week currently the maximum time resident concerned on Council is six years then they must take a break for one year one to move forward and again it changed for four year terms and expanding the limit do three terms means that a council member's pursue 12 years without a Time adapters you've exhausted your six minutes yes sir okay thank you very much do we have anyone else who would like to speak remotely nope all right thank you to everyone who spoke tonight we appreciate your comments all right we're on item three which is a presentation from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office I'll begin with a monthly law enforcement report good afternoon on that the Corporal I'm in with Pinellas County Sheriff's Office Harry presents your statistics for the month of June there's a total of 789 events in the city of Bel Air consisting of various directed patrols house tracks and traffic stops no crashes to report total of 192 citations and warnings were issued a majority of these being issued in Gulf Boulevard and Causeway Boulevard this thing of six assaults and four larcenes for reports for crime statistics and total of four people were arrested varying from traffic infractions to rewarding company arrest questions Council I do have a question without going into uh identity specifics what was the largest I don't have those specific Services is that it was just various tasks nothing major to know thank you very much right now we're on the monthly code enforcement report hello Debbie good evening Mr mayor council members staff and citizens uh Steve cochner for the record for the month of July I kept pretty busy again continuing keeping up with a lot of the uh growth problems as far as weeds and dead trees one of the biggest things that I had for this month or this last month was parking citations uh been pretty much controlling all the beach accesses and parking High areas to make sure that people are paying for for the parking I'm happy to say again that our unpermitted uh Contracting work is down again so I believe that the the homeowners and these contractors are abiding by the rules of Bel Air Beach and Pinellas County that's my report I'll stand for any questions councilman any questions no you're doing a great job thank you very much thank you sir you have a great evening and we'll see you next one all right it's Pinellas Suncoast here tonight yes sir please come up and please have your name and uh good evening I'm acting District Chief Steve Reich I'm here as on behalf of Chief Davidson at bsfrd to give your monthly report for July in the month of July there were 18 emergency responses in Bel Air Beach fire and EMS our fire training hours are recorded as uh 394.70 hours a year to date we're at 7 355 hours medical training hours 161 hours year to date is 773.5 hours total combined brings us to 555 hours and here today is 8 129 hours our update on fire prevention division our language safety inspectors are 68 annual inspections have been performed 127 re-inspections 197 total inspections 210 violations that were cited 35 contacts for public education in July our EMS division the district firefighters and paramedics completed eight hours of advanced cardiac life support training and July as part of a recertification with Pinellas County EMS that is additional to the medical training that I already listed above that is the final report for us okay before Oklahoma Council I'd like to make comment you gave us a lot of data okay we don't have anything to remember I could possibly run all that down yeah but we can either send you a copy or I can read I can give it to you again either way great if uh if whenever you guys present if you would leave a copy for the city clerk I'm still streaming to all of us great I appreciate it do we have any comments or questions from the household yeah all right all right thank you very much I appreciate you coming out tonight thank you thank you all right item five let's see the attorney report thank you and thank you uh Council for your Indulgence last month as I was traveling and unable to attend the meeting um I did want to take the opportunity ordinarily I would have done this last month but I do want to take the opportunity to briefly update you on some maybe some legislative changes that are starting to take effect between now and the month of October that that will impact some of what you see or don't see for that matter the first is Senate Bill 170. we talked extensively through session about Senate Bill 170. Senegal 170 goes a few things as it relates to the adoption of ordinances this is the statute that requires now economic impact statements for ordinances adopted after October 1st 2023 so there will be an element of the Staffing now that has to speak to for any ordinance via dog speak to its with some exceptions for sure um for instance if an ordinance is adopted pursuant to to make it compliant or consistent with state law or something like that um but with putting those exemptions aside absent exemption will have to have an economic impact statement or business impact statement those should be relatively easy in the city of Bel Air Beach where you do not have a commercial District to speak of however we still may need to know some of the more ancillary effects as you are part of the Barrier Island community tourism and the like so that's one thing that came out of Senate Bill 170. another thing that came out of Senate Bill 170 is the ability for litigants to challenge a city ordinance as recently as 2019 the legislature adopted a provision that gave litigants challenging an ordinance as preempted the ability to recover attorney's fees ordinarily in the American legal system you don't pay for the oversized lawyer win or lose unless there's a law or a contract that says so now there's a law that since 2019 there's been a law that says if somebody challenges the city ordinance that they can that they have they may have the ability to remember attorneys fees if that ordinance is expressly preemptive this has now been broadened from performances that are expressly preempted to those that are arbitrary or unreasonable know those terms are not defined um and so if someone brings a challenge that an ordinance is arbitrary or unreasonable and prevails they have the ability to cover attorney's fees up to fifty thousand dollars so that's a new provision with that there's also a new language that where an ordinance is challenged and as arbitrarily or reasonable or expressly preempted that the um that the ordinance should be suspended during the tendency of the proceeding suspension of enforcement so it's not enforced while the parties argue over whether or not it's legitimate and there's a lot more Nuance there but that's really some of the major things that came into effect with Senate building 70. um and those are changes to chapter 57 112 of the Florida Statutes and I've made your your advantage of therapies and we're talking about how we want to adapt as well as economic impact statements like another build you should be aware of here is Senate Bill 250. we've talked about this a little bit Senate Bill 250 is the bill that prohibits a community from adopting more restrictive or burdensome amendments to its comprehensive plan or Land Development regulations if that Community is within and partially or entirely a hundred miles of where Ian or remembering at the moment where each hurricane Ian may live it doesn't say first landfall it says landfall which is interesting since one of our Peninsula mainly involved Northern one place regardless we are as the pro flies within those hundred miles from pan Costa where Ian made his initial landfall and so that prevents the community from me from adopting any more restrictive Land Development regulations or comprehensive plan amendments through October of 2024 and it is retroactive to September 28 2022 the day that EMA went and so if an ordinance has passed that is deemed to be more restrictive or burdensome as a comprehensive plan or Land Development regulation and his team void AB initio meaning as it would perhaps avoid permanence Inception so that is a another gift from the legislature of the session obviously there's competing narratives on that that facilitates Redevelopment without government restricting it on the the counter argument to that is governments adapt based on what happened in the storm and change their regulations accordingly those changes can't be implemented now see what happens come October 24 when senate about 250s amendments go by the wayside but that is those are some two of the more notable ones I tell you that those two specifically because it informs what you're likely to see or not see in the coming months if you come and say hey Randy I want to make it so our Land Development regulations restrict doing a b and c I may say to you we're not in a position to do that presently and we'll have to analyze whether it is in fact more restrictive is it a Land Development regulation to begin with all of those things but that may inform what you and some of your support rewards to the extent that boards are his members of the boards are here tonight if you're on piano saying why haven't you seen anything that's that may inform the kind of business that the city does and also for your purposes when you start seeing economic impact statements or business impact statements in the coming months and you're wondering what is this new thing will you know addition you are already think that that's that's where that's coming from so there are a series of other legislative updates that I can provide and we've I've been providing those as they go I'm happy to answer any more specific questions but I wanted to make sure you're aware of those two more more notable changes as they relate to how local governments are thank you Mr Moore do we have any questions or comments yes Mr Banker where did you see that the legislator is determined uh Irma's mantle a number of Ian where I mean no and I just want to make sure yeah Costa um by the National Weather Service and I mean the chaos is down in Lee County and we are up here at the Nellis County at Miles like 91 to 99 in fact it just it occurs like just at uh Target now the reason I'm asking because I've been in a fight with being that you know getting some supportive federal government they're saying it was making landfill around Sanibel [Music] and that's why Elder Beach at least insurance and I said well let's take a quick survey here that's 100 and the thing also made statement [Music] in the circle would get impacted and I said well we're at 164 miles and is it in that measurement is that as the pro flies or by then you're a highway mileage yeah and we'll quickly in the Tallman says I think it's 200 miles nationwide's typical government management yeah the the generally accepted um knowledge is that it was Kia Acosta which is nearby but again it's skirted several businesses and so it has more than one landfall for purposes of Senate Bill 250 it just says landfall it doesn't say first event also for our purposes we're within the range outside of Oregon streams that they want to add this Thursday and Friday I think going on Saturday is the Florida League of cities annual conference I will be presenting there on Thursday for the four-hour ethics Sunshine month on the records presentation on Friday I'll be doing the presentation as part of the panel on Civility and efficient meetings you haven't already I'm sure they still take registrations if you're interested I know that's a last-minute announcement to make but I did want to make sure you're aware the other questions or comments from the council thank you very much Mr Moore all right now we are on the item six city manager reports Reaper thank you mayor so the first project we have on the report is our upcoming fiscal year 2023 24 budget the major piece that we're working on right now is getting the RFP turned in through the solid waste for recycling Contract Services we already issued the RFP it's on command Star we have three of the major waste players of the area which are [Music] and we have a mandatory preliminary meeting and they all attended so over the weekend we got the draft contract up and answered the first set of questions from the contractors and the deadline for the submission is August 18th so as soon as we get that in we're going to immediately start reviewing and being the selection process to a recommendation for contract negotiation so that's an important piece of the budget I just wanted to keep you up to date with that as far as dates there's also the in September is our first public hearing and on the budget and the proposed military so that's September 6th since day Wednesday because of Labor Day Holiday uh based on our last meeting our last Workshop Financial Consultant myself I've been preparing the draft for that first hearing the undergrounding project is moving on the contractors are put in the three and four inch conduit they have started a bigger six inch main conduit in the bolts with the concrete pads for the equipment so that phase one section of the conduit is expected to be sleep this month and from there it'll be pending on Duke Energy in Florida coming through and maybe with some wiring um which I expect to happen soon after unless we get some storms or something diverse resources um the stormwater Improvement products I have a meeting with Gemini engineering partners it was August 1st Avenue meeting and then reviewed the 60 submittals for the engineering plans we went over what they came up with so far as far as design worked through some key points that I and questions that I had I need to make sure we're on schedule for a work session this month because I design ideas so I tend to release schedule that for August 21st which is our usual third Monday of the month and then we will start working on the invitation event once we have our design completed the personal policy personal policy manual there is a ordinance that we're doing our first reading tonight the reason for that ordinance briefly is because in the history of personal policy changes we so in order for us to adopt a new personal policy manual we need to pass a new order so that kind of um relaxes and sets it up for adopter resolution which is okay to go because there's no need to have two readings um programs for personal policy we've just updated the resolution so that first reading is tonight I also provided the manual interest as a rehash we're at the first taking the city's handbook and current manual which is two documents with a HR consultant current school and we work through that to combined into one useful document to the employees and then after that passing through the city attorney's law firm and then you know review all the on the policies for uh to make sure it was proper proper legal wording and uh we finished that that's what I presented to you with the agenda the as an update I did the it um information on the intersection study that was mentioned was probably about four or five months ago it looks like the counties collected accounts that we talked about uh vehicle and traffic pedestrian traffic um they're consultant firm looks to put together the reports given me in a couple more months but they do have the preliminary numbers that they said they could start to assess that's what we keep it up to date on that um just as they go over some of the things that were brought up with with the uh the boat purchase the the sea wall inspection that kind of had a little out of hand um the main purpose was to be inspecting code violations on the water side of the properties um I know these do we want to thoroughly expect students or crypto or qualified to spicy laws I think the intention is to um which we see a lot more is knocks failing and lifts failing the the sea walls we have in the past have a problem with seawalls collapsing into the harbor um the hope would be to identify Seawall by General observation that there could be a major issue of failure and then do what's within our means I've tried to work out when people falling in that would be utilizing our city engineering um in our code violation process that was mine thoughts on that um the buoys so the buoys there is maintenance that you can do um before you actually have to you know we work the whole anchor system and uh some of that might be as simple as just unclipping Louis in the water and agree tying into a new movie and also the movies over time they they build up Barnacles around the bases of them so over time it kind of affects the buoyancy and sticks the booty under the water we actually are experience in that currently and that would be to prolong service purpose um there was some comments on the the fish from red tide and you know the smell of producers and they accumulate on the little fingers and the inlets and in the harbor the cut it is true that the county does contract out the fish pick up services but usually for that to happen it has to be an extensive fish kill and they had in my experience it's taken three weeks to give them an operation the last fish kill we have they didn't even activate the contractors so our staff went out there and picked up all the fish and got what we could out of the water but when the experience before that and we had a fish kill and they did activate the contractors we had all our fish picked up before they even got there and mainly the reason for that is it takes a very long time and um through our experience and the expectation of the residents to established fish up a lot faster than that contractor was going to get there so that's the reason of this stuff with other new staff was the reason we picked it all up before we got there um and there's I some mention of the stats and the streets uh versus the coastline um some of those stats are just uh perspective I was trying to give some perspective distance with some other assets no means is really trying to to write out the pair of boots the coastline so um Council any questions or comments yes Mr Roberts hi Bob um when I did speak with the transportation director for Pinellas County one of the things he told me they were going to take a look at was the timing of the traffic lights at Gulf Boulevard um so it appears to me that they did that what he was going to do was have some of his staff in India probably noticed that there's cameras there Causeway Boulevard and Gulf Boulevard so he was going to have his staff monitor those cameras and see how the traffic flow is going but and I have been verified this but it's pretty apparent to me that they changed some of the cycles for the good if you're traveling from north to south on York Boulevard and you're trying to make a left-hand turn to go across the bridge that light didn't stay the Green Arrow very long now it's staying green a very long time which I think has held significantly with the traffic in the morning when people are going to work to be able to make that left-hand turn so that that's a great thing also I've noticed that once that light does turn red for the left-hand turn if you come up to it it's apparent to me that they made some changes regarding if you're stopped there for the left hand turn there's no traffic coming from the south to the north that light remains red for just a short period of time and then the turn arrow turns green pretty rapidly and if there's no traffic coming that way so I think I've gotten feedback from some of the our citizens that make that make that travel in the morning to work and they've noticed that as well so I think that the county did a great job with that as it definitely has impacted shortening the left-hand turn lane and backing it up so that's a good thing so additionally on the 60 plan review just a couple of things that you had to discuss with the engineering firm and give them additional info to make some changes with regards to the 60 that you so when we looked at the 9th Street I told them that you know we needed to do whatever kind of improvements we can there at 9th Street and they they examined the whole elevation profile of that road and told me that um did there's really not much room to work but because it's basically flat from those inlets that are further to the West that come to um to the Sea World where the place would be at the end of the road so I told them when we need to find um and some way to give it some more holy capacity and the pressure necessary to make sure that um you know we're doing everything we can at that location so they're looking into possibly connecting from the junction of the pipe down towards the east side of the road connecting that with the system that is over by the retention pond so combine the two so we're going to see if if that makes sense if it will improve the flooding that one thing that in our discussion that we really came down to realizing is that that is by far one of the most crucial valves that we maintain because that that checked out is really what determines if it's cold water or not so it's you know if we can give that the attention it needs that are we doing it's always working that's really going to make the difference for those residents we're really looking at that I wanted to make sure that that we really explored what could be done in that area um some other things we talked about or just what areas does how's the condition of the pipe um is it better to line um the pipe does anything need to be done to the pipe at this point um also we talked about flow in certain areas do we have a problem with flow so is it necessary to change channel networks the am not still in new condition and we're not we don't need to do anything to it at all so a lot we looked at a lot of the different um streets and compare the systems and really instead of just following what was recommended originally we sort of use my experience of what I saw their new survey at out of the of those streets and kind of came up with the best course of action to justify what we're doing out there excellent thank you give me another Council all right Mr Rayford um going back to the crossing um the email to you and uh and you confirmed that we weren't discussing doing that removing that policy can you confirm that the county is not only that recommendation also they have not you don't have any I mean they're just collecting data at this point so okay they're going to tell us what they find unless they've got to you know rabbit in a hat somewhere I I don't see that as a practical solution ever because they'll never be able to leave their Street so I just wanted to go on record and say that um also I appreciate you clarifying easily convincing argument or justification of a boat however I think hopefully we've learned some some valuable lessons about how you present whenever you want to spend money in Bellaire Beach other than that um any last comments or questions from the counselor well all right thank you very much all right we're up to number seven my report is just an overview of the meetings and hearings that we've had this past month and the most significant being The Big C meeting where the topic was Beach nourishment and that's my report thank you very much

item number 12. consideration of ordinance 23-04 Mr Morrow would you mind reading the ordinance Captain Mr Mayor this is ordinance number 23-04 an ordinance of the city council of the city of Bellaire Beach Florida repealing previously adopted versions of the city's Personnel manual providing for the creation of chapter 2 Article 4 Division 1 Section 2-143 Personnel boss Emanuel making provision for the adoption and amendment of personnel policies via resolution providing for separability and providing for an effective date this has been a first reading ordinance number 23-04 by Title Loan Limited thank you Mr Mora this was placed on the agenda by Mr reefer would you like to comment on this ordinance Mrs yes I covered a little bit of it in the major report this is because we did some digging into the the past and found that ordinances were used to pass Personnel policies and to make it a legal document to adopt we need to passive markets to connect casual off the previous ones and set it up in a way that we can do it a little bit more efficient explicitively with resolutions thank you Mr Winkler before we go to the council and how would any citizen like to comment on this proposed audience no assessing comments Council I'm going to need a motion to approve this ordinance so somebody raising their hand but promoted no I need a motion to approve this ordinance all right this Livingstone do I have a second second taken by Mr Roberts Miss Livingstone you have the floor now I think Kyle the claims on very well and he is extremely important to engage your policies and procedures so thank you for our teachers thank you Mr Livingstone anyone else like to make a comment yes associates degree refers to a city manager and those places that just refers to suitable manager I'm assuming that's the same yes that is the same I can go through without that I could have that changed out to all city managers um the Personnel director we don't have one of those who said are we back to student manager how far down the page we're on page 11 um [Applause] Personnel director [Music] yes educational and and for clarity and procedurally speaking this ordinance the ordinance tonight does not adopt the draft you're doing these comments are well taken what I want to tell you folks is if you if you do sit down with this document and find concerns between now and your next meeting please let us know because it will be adopted on on by resolution which is only one reading at the next meeting this was provided to you now first so we can immediately get this kind of feedback and also so you can see what if we're feeling it what comes next which would be an actual question so just want to be clear procedurally where this is more of a strike ball ordinance the replacement is previewed here and your conference is Mrs are appreciated should I wait and just give you the other comments if if you have my Nets like that I think it may be easiest to get it to us in writing so we make sure we capture exactly what you're going on and I'm not trying to you as the council I work for you you're free to speak um I just wanted to make sure that if you have a series of substance of blindness that might be more more productive that way so material we're not [Music] I think the primary reason for doing this is for experience if we need to make a change and also we don't have to pay for an economic impact study well doing it now it definitely helps that way the other part of this is candidly solder with a bit of this as we went through negotiating with um manager candidates and otherwise that we were looking at policies and there was inconsistencies between what was called personal plan what was the Personnel policy which one are we pointing to and this is eliminating some of that confusion is streamlined it so we only have one governing document for individual purposes [Music] very much appreciated Mr Baker did you have a comment yeah are we but we need for this ordinance to adopt this personal name no sir we are voting to change the ordinance uh we're actually scripping things out of the ordinance so that we can alter a an employee handbook by resolution okay so this would be the handbook that will be so we are proposing a resolution next month that we'll adopt what we see there um it's it's sort of interesting because what we've done historically we did this as sort of a housekeeping cleanliness of the record matter uh you have periodically revised your personnel manual by ordinance but it doesn't appear codified anywhere in your qualified ordinances it's just we would adopt an ordinance and So to avoid any confusion on what supersedes what this says anything that was done in the past we're about to supersede by resolution and we're going to make it clear in our code that when we change this in the future it will be by resolution so there's no guesswork that was as to what is the best we ever see all right my biggest complaint is on page five appointment at will and age 11 part disciplinary action issue foreign foreign this is to approve coordinates 23-04 would you please call the rules council member Banker ordinance you guys council member Livingstone yes council member Notaro council member Roberts aye AmeriGas I so it passes unanimously 5-0 we will have a second reading in final of next month all right we are on to item 13. this review offer our city manager to execute an extension to the memorandum of understanding for accounting services Mr reefer you have it for taking America so this is our Financial Consultant Andrew tests he's CPA and honor Ian Works Heather who is our day today this is this agreement is a continuing agreement and it actually has written input that um 100 it would continue the agreement annually and negative three percent so um we started this with them as early as 2019 and uh we found out that three percent rate and this is uh official acceptance of that we're going to continue to use them at the new rate which is an increase of three percent and um but that is budgeted in our upcoming budget to to meet that requirement so I included the current uh memorandum of understanding and off the past along with the agreement s hey Mr Reaper let's go to the citizens for comments or you would like to speak on this topic all right assistant comments up close uh before we continue I'm going to need a motion of the council second second all right this material you have before any other questions or comments I just have a quick question was there ever a time in our history where we actually had an employee that provided this service yes actually no it's a 2019 so yeah it was shortly after our previous employee Who's acting as a Finance came over the official title um she resigned and then this is this is the solution outsources yeah any other questions all right let's do a voice code all in favor all right any opposed all right Mr Richard you are all for us to proceed thank you all right next up item 14 authorization or issues to authorize the city manager to execute a service agreement with Victor and I said it earlier period okay mystery thank you mayor so this is the outcome of past two meetings trial of this equipment that he's been setting up of basically when we started doing the zoom software for our meetings we purchased a kind of a classroom style camera it's a wide Zoom but when we put it into action we sort of realize it doesn't really focus in well on anything so the people at home watching and just see this hazy screen of what's going on and it's tough to follow so through talking to Mr granick we kind of came up with the idea of using these equipment which is a little bit uh well it's a lot better than ours high quality to integrate it into our current system to provide a better live viewing experience for the people at home which is you know multiple cameras he has a much better microphone that kind of picks up the room so uh over those two years we were testing and I saw the improvement from people associating the second meeting and he's continuing to improve the array um so this disagreement it incorporates him the extra Manpower and needed to to do all the administration on these cameras the operation the cameras the microphone and also the plus is like as we saw tonight when we have uh remote speakers piece at the helm to control all that from us so it's kind of a solution needed um so yeah I I believe that you know the price that he's offered to do this service is I recommend that we take it I take it drastically improves they've been doing for people that don't know what to read and the more residents we can get to participated watching readings I think it's a good thing thank you Mr Rayford continued with the council and you go to the citizens for comments we would like to speak right it says how much are closed before we continue I'm going to get a motion from the council to offer out a city manager for them to execute the service agreement [Music] but we allow our city manager to negotiate onto work with the firm that we're working with and execute this contract to provide additional service did you get all that hey would anyone like to second that Mr Roberts yeah before thank you yeah I think it's uh it's obvious that this is going to provide a better product for our citizens at a fee that's not really that bad so I think any time we can do that this allows more citizens to participate in our meetings that's a good thing so that's why I'm in favor of other questions or comments I would like to say that I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far I'm sure that this is a service the way that everything's changed there's there's a still room for improvement but I think that as we have more and more meetings you will definitely get dialed in my only complaint at this time is sound I don't know how we can get on top of it the sound was better but I believe it was It was a distance fee weird Echo that definitely threw me on it was difficult to listen to but I have a good feeling you're going to get that dialed right in and don't be afraid to if we move forward with this don't be afraid to to come to us and say pen to speak up a little louder in the next meeting or get the microphone closer or whatever any other questions or comments no all right let's take it to a voicemail all in favor any opposed all right congratulations Victor look forward to working with you and Mr Reaper you were authorized to proceeding thank you all right we are now on to unfinished business and we have a unfinished business nope all right we're now up to city council comments this month we begin with council member Liz thank you so I just wanted to um talk for a minute offices and comments I really appreciate everybody's feedback you know our job is to take the expertise of the city managers and with your guidance hope to make was right Institute and for the city so all City comments are very much appreciated I think sometimes there might be some data out there that's not accurate but the fact that that's why we come together to talk about that and to bring everybody back into perspective and I believe it was Mr Lusk I believe that stated there were several other Barrier Island cities that also had a vote I wasn't aware of that so that feedback I really appreciate it as well as everybody else's feedback so let's utilize our time wisely and use our citizen comments use our time to express how you feel about things because that's going to help us make our decisions and do what's right for the city so thank you thank you Mr Livingston uh I guess it was ladies first tonight uh Mr chair of your next security Mr Roberts nothing new and uh Mr Baker um I've been speaking about flood insurance and GPS meetings I've been working centers Scott's office became a frustrated to say at least finally what the team that I spoke about a month ago we got a generic political letter back to that I was pushing the issue a little bit farther and doing this and we found out that there's a case 2.23 cb01839 filed against the nfip and these are all the reasons I've been citing that towns and cities there's 10 states that have entered shoe against NFI towns and cities cannot find their discounts that they've been they've been afford it under 2.0 feet of 2.0 it also when a citizen like myself complains or arrest any complaints and says hey I've got a blood elevation certificate of the four feet of love this I should have gained 40 off of my flood ratings FEMA cannot give any answers to this so this suit was filed it's supposed to be expedited but we know how the government works they're hoping to get an answer back sometime this year I don't know if there's going to be retributions you know recovery of money or whatever I definitely this is a mess and a half um I just want to chime in on the purchase of the food too I don't think it is still our best interest within our city to buy a boat for a price of 85 or 100 Grand reasons one we do not have the staff equipped to maintain or reform the task for your water I want to know we only have two maintenance workers here barely keep up with your agenda now we further has to purchase underwater equipment or some other other duties noted if you do buy a remote expecting buoys and everything like that possibly going into the water remaining three deep before the Coast Guard stands renting a boat we could enter in the movies this would emits maintenance storage insurance I want to know boat Insurance presently is four grand a year arguments of leasing encouraging I've been talking to citizens some say it's better to just buy the boat and in a couple years if we lease the boat it would pay for itself I did some research on that if I'm in torch and I want to go buy or rent a pontoon boat it'll cost me 500 for six hours times two okay we're going to use it twice a month that's twelve thousand dollars a year times five that's sixty thousand dollars minus four thousand dollars times five years for the for the insurance that's 20 000. we're now down to forty thousand dollars and that's using a pontoon boat as he tours we could simply enter a lease with a boat company get the boat whenever we want it use the boat when we need it probably cost us a fight here period under twenty thousand dollars leasing a boat we don't have any maintenance anyone that's owned a boat I'm sure there's maintenance on it I had a boat years ago it was a big hole I threw my money all right um I found out that we did have a boat as we know me tonight when we had around uh police department where the hell is it I heard we gave it to the Pinellas County please whatever the sheriff's department took over our entire operation they got all the equipment called inventory of Sheriff's Department so I'm totally against why you know oh Kyle I think you're a great guy I think he uh some of you are actually they if we do need to use a boat every now and then but I just don't think this city can afford a hundred grand for a boat we don't have Commercial Business in the city if we keep these spending habits up what's going to happen I don't believe any rocks has vote saying he doesn't have a boat thank you thank you Mr Baker all right concerning Beach nourishing on the 26th of July Bellard Beach hosted The Big C where County Administrator Barry Burton and Public Works director Kelly Levy discussed the Dilemma created by the Army Corps of Engineers and they're digging in on requirement or required 100 easements which by the way they got ours they also responded to the multiple commands that have that they've received from myself and other Mayors to immediately self-fund the nourishment projects with the TVC money that has been reserved for that very purpose uh many of you may have seen that it's uh about 36 million at this moment of our money because anybody who has a fair tax it goes into that fund and by the way that's only a half cent on every dollar collected the rest of it goes to advertising primarily all over the world to bring people here to guess what see the beach that's no longer here so uh last week there's some good news last week the board of County Commissioners voted to place me on these you're not going to believe this the tourist Development Council by serving on the TDC my primary function will be to keep reminding its members the importance of maintaining our Shoreline while urging the county to increase the bed tax and to do the right thing and let's go it alone and quit waiting on the Army Corps of Engineers to change their mind if others are able to put an end of the stalemate at a later date they should have no issues with us protecting our land during the course project blackout also last week I had a web conference with representative Lunas the chief of staff and Clifford Gibbons of Bel-Air Beach I wanted Mr Gibbons to have the opportunity to share his ideas on how to motivate the Army Corps this material you may have recalled he was uh he was an important player in that in making that happen they were receptive to Mr Gibbons ideas but assured us his suggested tactics had already been tried in Fallen flat they have another plan to permanently resolve the problem of the course requirements but will not be able to implement it until sometime next year basically what they're going to do is they're they're going to insert some language that will prevent the Army Corps from being able to do this ever again supposedly we'll see if that actually happens or not but right now I have no reason to believe otherwise I was assured that representative Luna had made each nourishment her top priority while she is in office and plans to hold a q a session for all Mayors on the big sea on August the 14th let's hope that she has some good news for us finally I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to contact me directly concerning the possible purchase of a city on boat even more so I'd like to thank all those who cared enough about our city to look me on a social media Post in an anonymous email from a fictitious Organization for the whole tree as always and I'd like to thank everyone who came out tonight and to those who also watch this meeting remotely would anyone like to make a motion pleasure said Mr Bankers do I have to say Mr Roberts all in favor aye any of those good night everyone"
