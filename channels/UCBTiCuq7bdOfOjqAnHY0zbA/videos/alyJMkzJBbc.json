which is why we're here today so Kyle has um so graciously and the the guys set up the room for us the only thing we need are two more tables the welcome tables ah to check eight letters six letters six letters okay yeah two six Footers that go right up one outside each entry door um and then so today we'll just basically be putting tablecloths on all the tables and setting up um the little stations we don't have a whole lot the the coolers are here though the paddle boards here so Nicole and I will set up the foundation table um all the drinks should be cold except for the water except for the water I can stick water in this fridge yeah that'd be good so everything will be cold tomorrow so like right when we get here everything's cold we can just put it in the coolers and put it on ice but the coolers coolers will all be here and we'll have I think five five coolers we'll have one for maybe we need six coolers because we have Bud Bud Light Stella and Michelob Ultra and then we have Coke Diet Coke water and then we wanted a little cooler of clean ice which that's what likes I brought cups and an ice scooper in case someone who wanted a Coke or Diet Coke and they wanted a cup and they didn't want to drink out of the can so all of those coolers will be against the wall behind Dev D who's bartending tomorrow so like and then the table will be set up where we'll have a display one can or bottle of each of what we have we have a bar menu we'll have a bucket for her to put that use she can rip them up and put them in the little white bin um and I'm tasting notes for the two wines that we have I brought a wine key I wrote a wine bucket like how many times have I been here I mean I've been here so many times this week dropping loads off so like everything we need just needs to be literally set in place so it should be like that because um the only thing that's gonna be maybe take a minute is to the signs that I made for like to say this bowl is gluten-free crackers like I made a little sign that says gluten-free so we'll tape it underneath that bowl but I brought like you know those acrylic rolls that I bought like in a set of 12 so those are for all the crackers I brought tongs I brought Scoops so nobody will be touching the food you know and that's one table just the like fluffy stuff yeah the condiments because it's an eight foot table we're gonna have the condiments on one end because it's really just like three or four bowls of crackers and then at the other end of the eight foot table will be the voting section and we have voting instructions on every table there's going to be a printout of the voting instructions and then on the other end of the condiment table there'll be the three buckets so say we use red blue and yellow and they'll each get a red blue and yellow ticket when they check in and we'll go through all of this tomorrow too because there'll be at least two people at the entry door um so like say they come in and um they didn't buy a ticket we're not going to have it we're not going to say 12 at the door we're gonna say 10 now because we don't want to make change well I was I was that's what I was like yeah so it's going to be 10 and then so like if they're brand new they pay you the ten dollars you check their ID you give them an ID bracelet they have to sign a waiver and then you give them um the voting the three voting tickets that they need and then you give them like basically like a spoon and a napkin which we will have on the entry tables and then they can um and I'll go through that again because I can tell you're I'm just looking at this you're very organized yeah well it's a lot and it is we have to have the waivers and the wristbands I had a restaurant yeah so it's what about if we put the like if we had a cup and we put like the spoon and the napkin and then we put the three tickets on the bottom of the cup and then they just take the cup yeah do we have cups for that if not I think I might have some red cups if not I'll get them well we could probably find enough I mean it's not that many cups yeah but it would just be like you know what I'm saying like oh they get their first cup to be wasted then though because you're not gonna be able to use it yeah okay well what I was thinking is um like to maybe have just a a piece of paper printed out and I didn't I thought about this but I never said anything that says you know chili cook off with the tasting notes and then staple the three tickets to the top which might take us a hot minute but then like if they chilling and just say chili one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and then if they want to make notes as they're tasting them and then they know that the red ticket is this category the green assistant Depends for everybody then yeah there's gonna be pens on every table and there's gonna be pens on the voting table so like in a cup and then the instructions will be taped and then a cup with pens on each table I think that's what we talked about um but still but if they bought their ticket in advance then they should be able to go hey here are my tickets I already paid and then you still have to ID them give them a wristband sign the waiver they get the cup so the only difference is they're not handing you the money um and you're not giving them the drinks and they can only pay in cash yes right yes because we have no way to take the credit card what happens it doesn't have cash hopefully and go get some or borrow something yeah like with like Andy Anthony wanted something and he then moaned me and I had cash and then we do have I have 200 well this is for the foundation Kyle has cash like a drawer for park and rec I have a bank for the foundation so um that'll be separate or whatever well I have cash at home so I can always like put in my person if someone wants to venmo me or something because I think I I don't know what you had me assigned at but I can always help at the front too yeah because that would be great I don't need to do the foundation and my mom knows she has to serve two chilies so well I didn't really have any like I just was kind of thinking like Deb's like I'd like to be the bartender so I said okay perfect and then like Deb the smell of Chili's kind of making her a little nauseous so like if people want it better if people want to come out and buy more drink tickets they come out and she's going to be out in the entryway like you don't have to stay out there the whole time but you just kind of have to man the table right um because like that um they don't pay cash at the bar ever if they want to get another glass of wine or another Coke or another beer they have to come back to you and buy more tickets and the tickets are five dollars a piece they don't have to buy two for ten they can buy one drink ticket at a time for five dollars so it's the same thing so a Coke is five dollars everything's the same price you're supporting the foundation I'm not I'm not the foundation I'm not making comments no it's good yes maybe we'll see it's for the alcohol and everything else I mean it's just all that we could charge ten dollars for the alcohol drinks and charge 250 for the cokes if you'd like but we just thought it'd be easier if you just it's five dollars across the board right yeah that's great and I would think most people aren't going to have them with the two anyway yeah but if someone like wants a third they can have one We're not gonna like monitor especially you know it's I think people will be responsible so um we can get into all of that because I don't want to repeat all of this when Deb gets here which I'm going to have to repeat all of that again anyway but just like the gist of it but to answer your question like we're just gonna divide and conquer because I want to make sure that everybody knows every job because everyone's going to have to give everybody a break so everybody can eat except for you bring your sandwich bring your power yeah so you don't have to each other you can have Saltines um so does anybody have any questions on that for right now until later because once we get all the boxes out and drag them in the room it'll make more sense um okay so the holiday social and tree lighting the only change on that it is still December 5th um it's only from five to six the setup will be exactly the same as last year except for we're going to have two tables of food and it's because we're actually going to have real food this year because a lot of people come right from work to the event and so they don't have to scrounge or starve or eat a cookie for dinner we're going to get sliders ordered from belar market and then we're gonna go to Costco like the Friday before and get some fruit and veggie trays and some cheese and some hummus they do a good job yeah and then we'll get like a sweet tray there and we'll get um like maybe a bag salad just if someone wants like a sandwich and a salad as opposed to you know chips or whatever um so we're gonna have real food and a sweet table and then we I don't know if we want to deal with the hot chocolate again this year or if we just want to do water what do you guys think I would say just water yeah and partial I'm impartial too but I have a lot of hot chocolate last year I don't even know you know what I Nora made it and I didn't clean it up so I don't know how much we had left over I'm just thinking everyone will drink water and I know not everyone drank hot chocolate I'm thinking a lot of people won't eat food either but you know we'll it'll be a good lesson you'll see what happens yeah because they won't be expecting it they might even before they come it's just five to six it's not like it's like they're thinking they're gonna be here for a long time well they're just heavy apps it's not like we're you know right cutting board and slicing yeah I think the water goes better with the food and because last year we just had desserts and then we had the hot chocolate so so water is good it's easier too because the hot chocolate and the dispenser and all of that and it all depends on the weather like if it's 80 degrees um and then four o'clock is set up on that one okay I think we got here at four o'clock last year and we had like what are we selling that one are we selling anything yeah we're selling um everything so that's it'll be the same setup as last year so we'll have one merchandise table and then the only thing is we're adding a food table because we'll do like water and sweets and the plates and stuff on one and then we'll do the food on the other and we're not gonna go overboard at Costco we really aren't and we're not going to go overboard on the desserts either how many people do we have last year I would say 75. pretty good I think so too yeah laughs so let me get more so otherwise everything else is the same and then she's gonna post about what is being sold and I I think that'll get people here too so we'll see how that goes do we get this stuff I know we got the towels but do we get the bags yet or no no not yet okay um Kyle thought like maybe the logo was a little too pinkish and so she ordered a lighter peachy looking one and it should be in but if it doesn't get in time she's going to make them the same color as the towels and then we'll move forward with it being Peach because even that one doesn't look Peach that one looks tan yeah yeah and then the last one he had on was gray so it's not like they're all the same anyway so if they may be pink she said I should have it any day but if I'm not getting any time I'll make them did you see the bag it's really cool it's like a little fanny pack like black and it has the logo on the front because like you know people walk the bridge yeah jog so just like kind of cute and then at an event like instead of like carrying around the like bag you can just put all the money in there and stuff so we'll be cool something different yeah it'd be good and then we'll um we will post and put on the sign the toy drive and we're what was the dates of that again I think it was just the first through the ninth remember is that toys from tots again yeah we'll just find a drop off for Toys for Tots yeah does anybody have a um a preference or a suggestion for the dates no that's the first of the ninth I think a smaller window is probably better what day of the week sorry about and they're unwrapped yeah the ninth is a Friday and it's on Monday so if they can't come on Monday it's so a Thursday through a Friday the 1st through the 9th yeah because if we post then by like the fifth is the event so hopefully they'll bring it with them and then if they forget they have four days to get it here yeah so that's good and then um as far as the update on the health and wellness Fair we're pretty good we're sitting at like participants like health and wellness participants right now we probably have at least five pendings so like we have two months to you know double back with them but um otherwise we're in pretty good shape with that so we have a couple new people that weren't here last year and then quite a few are returning so it'll be good and now they kind of know what to expect and right that's better yeah we get dollar coffee working on it I haven't been there and then the dog's age so I need to go back there and show myself no I just gave up coffee but oh really but um yeah I'm supposed to that's one of the reasons my stomach has been right now yeah I tried okay anybody have any questions on that okay like we have two events before that so it's like it has not been at the Forefront of my mind but I will send out a text an email a plug when I think how do they pay just cash day of cash day was fine or they can venmo in advance or they can come in and pay city hall however they want to do it so I'll just on the on the tracker that I have that's all color coded I have a pay box at this point so we'll just see we're charging 25 for the health and wellness fair for the um people that are participating and they're basically to pay for the bags and some food in the room for them but mostly because it's like people like last year they had giveaways and people were walking around with stacks of paper and samples and and so it'll be good for like a little bag so we'll we need to work on the bag but that won't be a big deal and then does anybody have a question about that for now okay but we're in pretty good shape for that and then um I don't know why that says that December 5th holiday oh yeah the next meeting December 5th holiday social setup so yeah four o'clock we got here at four o'clock last year and I remember just standing around for a long time but do you want to make it later just kind of keep it that because of the emergency but exactly four yeah or even if anyone needs to come at 4 15 it's fine okay so we'll just leave that because we'll have like more food and stuff this year to put out and stuff right okay those last year we only had like two trees or whatever we had dessert and we're gonna try to get rid of the um not get rid of but the existing inventory like the t-shirts and the tanks and the hats um we'll have those out and then we'll have the new beach towels we'll have the hand towels that we only have a couple of left maybe six six or eight hand towels left and then we have whatever towels are left and let's say we have at least 30 32. and then we'll have the bags Deb has bought like quarter of the bags about five I'm like I don't know the whole inventory no they're cool I think they're different we'll see how they work I think if she posted They're Gonna Fly and the um the beach towels are like truly beach towels they're like 50 by 70 or something they're big so anyway so four o'clock for that unless you need to come at 4 15. and then proposed dates for our January meeting um I'm gonna have Patty send it out to everybody because I'm hoping to have all five people at the January meeting before the health and wellness fair so it'll be early in the month um I have the ninth or tenth down but it needs to be before the 14th um and then we don't need to do set up the Friday before the health and wellness Fair we didn't last year right because you guys set up the tables and they do their own tables all we have to do is set up our welcome table which takes 32 seconds right so if we get here half an hour for you we did the layout last year you know whatever you want yourself what do you mean remember how much we moved that stuff around the table yes with the numbers that's when George lost his crap we like moved the tables well why would we do a different leadership over here over there we don't have to change the thing from what we ended up with last year did you hear that is that okay if we leave it as we had last year yeah and the people can even take the same exact spots because like whoever needed electricity last year is going to need electricity this year the only thing is the only ones I didn't like were those two Corner diagonals because they didn't seem to get a lot um I would have in retro the Telehealth I was in the Hall of Georgia the whole time I hardly saw anything in there the Telehealth though she had to be there because she had Steven's yeah a three-year-old so that was kind of her choosing but like by the kitchen you know it didn't really those two those two didn't really work out that well and then we had people that didn't show up last minute so it's like we should have you moved Tara up to that point instead of moving that table out or whatever we did but I think pretty pretty much people can go exactly where they were last year and we had how many repeats you have versus him um I would say 75 are repeats so a lot give me all your repeats and I can stick them at the same tables okay oh yeah because you kept going back in the room and changing the did anybody use it did anybody use those what I was watching you guys change things no no no like I'm talking about the map yeah because we changed tables you had to go back and then I can change the map you were adjusting the math yeah so we'll try not to do something new just we'll be better this year so are you saying we need to come in on Friday I am we're just sad I think you can pull it off we were here at nine o'clock I need to come back we were just here at nine o'clock on Saturday and I don't know sure we'll see as it gets close here like we can decide at the meeting on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or whatever day we have it we'll see where we are and what we have laid out but I have a feeling we won't need to okay okay and then does anybody else have any other business I'd like to make a motion to adjourn today's Park and record meeting May I have a second ah the second it all in favor okay so what's your"
