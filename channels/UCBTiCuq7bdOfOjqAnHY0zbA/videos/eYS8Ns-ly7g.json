will now come to order let's do the Pledge of Allegiance please the United States of America and to the Republic which stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all Eddie would you please call the roll Pleasant council member Leslie notero here council member Mike zabel mayor Dave Gattis here city manager Kyle riesler yeah and City attorney Randy Moore president and council member Livingstone and Roberts and vice mayor Shirley are not in attendance yet and for the record we do have a quorum all right uh before I asked for approval of the agenda I think uh it would be fitting to flip items two and three so that we have a presentation of our current state uh so uh uh would anyone like to make a motion to amend the agenda do I have a second second all in favor aye aye any opposed all right the agenda is amended uh now we need to approve the agenda as amended do I have a motion I have a motion from Leslie natera do I have a second and Frank Banker all in favor aye any opposed all right the amended agenda is approved uh so we'll go right to uh item number two which is Emergency Management update by city manager reefler thank you mayor so as you've probably heard over the weekend the uh National Hurricane Center has been reporting that tropical depression number 10 has turned into new tropical storm iwf and it is still on path for the Florida West Coast including Palace County area uh the last situation report I have from the county I know right now I'm still projecting heavy rains starting later to now the prediction is six to eight inches um so it rains as soon as Timmy enter tomorrow on six to eight inches and there's a significant amount especially at ballet boots um so we'll be aware with the tides that we're going to experience this week we're looking at um 3.6 relatively around noon um so with that alone over there when our check rentals everywhere throughout the city um that they won't really empty midday we forget uh large amounts of rain we're going to expect fresh water flooding in the streets um on top of that we're expecting tropical force uh store travel refers runes uh as early as 7 P.M on Tuesday night um a hurricane Force wins as late as well excuse me as early as uh Tuesday night um and that would be up to a cat certainly at this point is projected [Music] um certainly right now is it's the timing is looking to be Wednesday morning which is beneficial uh based on the way the tides are coming to the real estate area it won't be during one of those pink high tides but they are predicting as a last report uh storm Soldier four to seven feet which is significant um regardless of what the tide is at that will affect residents of dollar Beach as always with hurricanes for water spouse tornadoes ESC for the camera will be at full activation starting tomorrow I'm wearing level one it may be sooner um depending if they have an executive policy group meeting at noon today um I expect that there'll be decisions made shortly after we started posting uh information on the website on the semiology constant contact to the residents about our sandbag station activation started at 7 30 a.m this morning I'm going to go to at least 6 PM I don't know we have two twin yard loads scheduled to be delivered should be coming late this morning when the truck leaves um one will go to start another policy and replenish the soon going over at Bayside Park and depending on when that second one is timed um and where our lines are at well I'm considering going to uh alone at the marina right now we have three operational staff our public World staff working in the same bag station s around if we do decide to go to um at an alternate location at the city marina I don't know in terms of the volume and the uh you know the demand goes up high enough it'll be beneficial to have two locations working um depending on how fast that sand goes I plan on ordering more sand uh but there will be a point uh because the storm is moving fast and we're looking at Tropical force winds by 7 pm tomorrow uh the city staff will need to abandon the sand station just leave it open for residents to get sand leave the bags um start locking down securing you know City buildings parks um so just that's something we're at the player playing with um if we if our level any evacuation starts um the storm continues to move as quickly as it is then we're gonna have to start you know through um through fuel in the equipment and moving equipment and securing down the building and starting to blend when we started last week but um I have nothing [Music] um going around to the construction sites getting those secure so from the for the wins that we're expecting um we have eliminated a hurricane reentry passes right now I spoke to Deputy fowling with parents kind of Sheriff's family he was bringing their passes and uh early this afternoon um [Music] currently the city could use volunteers at sandbag stations and um possibly with the uh the re-entry passes we tend to have people come in that have had them and they're registered they just don't know where the pass is so right now with the limited amount we're doing one pair I said [Music] um but depending on probably going to stick to just the one per household right now so we don't run out um I imagine it's going to be the same situation if uh not everybody has a past there's going to be alternate means to get back on the island like they did for Ian so so it was uh just to keep in mind is to reach out um it's still coming it's coming fast we should expect fresh water flame um [Music] after it gets past the startless past Cuba it'll have a good idea of what it's doing um but we have to plan for the worst and hope for the best at this point thank you Mr reefer um can you give us an update on uh what the county has done uh so far so so far the county just had a commissioner that outcome Commissioners moving by Kenny and no declare listing of local emergency [Music] hours to do a level any imagination it takes about 72 so I think they're gonna have to make a call soon on that um so there will be an update we I have a city managers meeting with the county in Australia at one point and then there is a um Rock much Rock call which is all the emergency Personnel in the area at 3 pm Council question the re-entry passes don't expire do they yeah okay okay any other questions for Mr Reaper no no all right uh thank you for that update uh I I would like to add on to that that there are certain areas in our community that already flood uh without a storm like this um I would advise everyone in those areas to go ahead and make serious preparations uh if uh whether they have a mandatory evacuation or not they should prepare for the worst and uh and start thinking about uh the best way to seek shelter and a Higher Ground um also if you have any elderly neighbors that are not upwardly mobile please check on them and uh and make sure that uh that they have a way out also if necessary I do expect some of these homes uh in the first through nights area to have water around them so let's all think about our neighbors and uh remember that we are Bellaire Beach and we're a loving community so um any other questions or comments for the city manager no all right so we will now move on to item three which is consideration of resolution 23-05. Mr Moore would you mind reading the uh another resolution please happily Mr Mayor this is resolution 2023-05 a resolution in the city of Bellaire Beach Florida declaring a state of local emergency in Beller Beach due to Tropical Storm Medallia slash hurricane Adalia and its potential threat of harm to the Sid to the residents and property of the city of Bellaire Beach this has been a reading of resolution 2023-05 by title only thank you Mr Moore before we move forward uh let's go to the citizens for comments uh would anyone like to make a comment on this resolution uh did we see anyone remotely that yeah let's just check that right quick I guess unneuted uh Mr Roberts can you name this ah can you hear me now I don't I don't think he's he's able to speak Mr Roberts would you like to uh all right can you hear us yeah I can hear you guys and I can see you perfectly all right uh I'm gonna close citizen comments and uh now I'm gonna need a motion to move forward with this resolution move forward with the resolution all right motion made by uh Frank binkler do I have a second second a second by uh Mike zabel um I guess we need to do a Voice vote on this one all right so um before we do that uh what any Council like to make any comments no no all right Patty would you please call the roll mayor do we include council member Roberts or no uh we can uh we can put him on record if he's able to use the vote okay yes um councilman Otero yes councilmember Roberts yes Mr Robert shake your head up and down if you uh okay yes I see the thumbs up thank you thank you council members either yes mayor goddess yes mayor um vice mayor schroederer also says yes okay all right please add uh she's she must be texting in she texted me she's listening is that a vote yes yes we can accept it okay thank you all right so the resolution passes unanimously um and that concludes this meeting would someone like to make a motion to adjourn Mr Mayor yes sir would be property arrested in the future could we give it there during his term the authority to invoke the Declaration of her emergency without calling the council uh yes and and they have you have the ability to make that Proclamation without the need for a meeting and then ratify it after the fact retroactively which is also done in other communities um so that's something we can we can make sure is explicit or clear if it's not already in your policies okay and I can make that motion right now okay the motion is for giving the mayor the ability to for state of emergency to make a declaration of it so so we would have to codify that um just procedurally we've already done it for NASA we're good for now right um as far as going in the future we would get a resolution of remnants in our code to make that clear um so we don't in as much as it's desired I think it's clear that's desired and I can make that a an action item okay or we don't need a motion or second at this point okay great hopefully we won't need that right all right uh do I have a motion to adjourn motion made by Frank Banker do I have a second second uh Mike said it all in favor aye any opposed aye all right thank you so much uh for making this coil Randy can I see you guys in the private place with the mayor don't worry that's why I hope you're bringing the City attorney in that's right all right thank you take care foreign"
