    "transcript": "so it's five o'clock and uh i'll call the meeting to order everybody i've got everybody here and the only one out here is jody shirley and put a check by i just should be here all right i assume he'll be here i mean she mentioned to me she last night she'd be here yeah she said she so um can we get approval of the agenda i'll move that it be approved a second all in favor more any post okay uh the meeting minutes did you guys get a chance to review the meeting minutes if there's an extra copy of the minutes this is your chance i'm not going to worry about it i think here oh okay [Music] yeah okay thank you bro really fine with you yeah but that was over an hour those them i was not at the meeting and i see about the recommendation to the council about the height of hedges and so forth what's the next step for that it's going to go into an ordinance and they'll take it to a all right so john seconded it all in favor of the minutes any posts five zero all right so discussion of the sign orbit so we talked last night we looked through the ordinance and we had made some changes which were in the minutes of the certain sections and and uh i think the spirit of today's discussion was around um patty sent us all some of the other uh we got longboat bel air balor bluffs and indian rocks beach uh sign ordinances to review uh mostly looking at the political signs is what i did i didn't think i didn't want to go through 30 pages of certain ones so i mean i think we came to the conclusion last week or last meeting that the ordinance was the existing side ordinance was good the whole purpose was to address political science so i guess we'll throw it up into discussion as far as what we viewed on the other cities you know the first thing i as i read through all this stuff i thought first did we get any answers on what's legal what are the legal constitutional restrictions that the city can pose because that's going to be the big dripping block right well fred had done a rather wimpy sign and remember there the only thing that was really in it was days to remove the sign which was 30 days after we removed the side our ordinance now is much shorter than that i think it's like two days or so i noticed in the other ones that nobody know what none of these examples she gave us does anybody provide a you can only put signs out x number of days prior to the election a lot of them talk about how long you have to take them back down some as short as 48 hours some 30 days but nobody evidently well goes into hey you know you can only put them up 45 days before or whatever and that goes back to what the mayor said was that you could have a political sign in your yard anytime you wanted to if you put one there and somebody didn't like it too bad it's free speech you can have a politic or some sign or whatever in your front yard which makes you think based on the maybe we can't so reddington stores didn't have what we had before is that you had to be a qualified candidate yeah yes well but you can't qualify until typically 45 days no it's december our qualifying december so 90 days the 45 days really started in like january they qualify and yeah some of the sign ordinances say you've got to be a qualified candidate to put a sign out well that's not all that's telling you is they've got to be qualified you can't doesn't mean that you are running for the office but you need to qualify to run for the yeah well i can i interpret qualifying for office as you're a candidate i mean you file the paperwork to run for said office okay once the supervisor's order of elections that's how it works once you get like here we'll say once you yeah you let's use you know you get the cards all signed they're turned into the supervisor of elections and you're not qualified until the supervisor election qualifies you right because they've got to verify that the card you turned in are voters and sometimes they're kicked back so when they say you you're qualified then that's when you're qualified until that time you can say you're a candidate but that's that's for a candidate if i want to run for office i have to wait until i'm the supervisor elections says you're qualified now i can put signs but if i wanted to put a political sign in my yard right now there's nothing stopping right well as a regular citizen it does i see nothing in here that says that i must only display a political sign from a qualified candidate say i want to draft lin to run for president in 24 i could put elin reeves yeah if it meant the size and the location specifications so i guess apparently that's so that's what i was going to say it appears that everybody is staying away from start dates as when you can just display these things because of the constitutionality problems but but it's okay to say you have to place them all up x number of days after the election but your sign for someone who didn't qualify to run for president my my next question was what what is the problem we're trying to solve or that we are going to recommend that the council do something to solve what is the problem we need to put parameters around political science so like how bel air as you know section n political signs points one two three four uh but is that to get more definition on that is it really just the start how soon prior to election you can put the sign out if you're a candidate is that really the problem that's that's what brought the things yeah it's a lot of ah yeah yeah so if we if they modified the ordinances to take that out no earlier than 45 days or whatever it is is that so i guess the question is if we just say you have to be a qualified candidate the art sites go out qualified candidate and then we have to say they have to follow these guidelines right can't be on public property right and it can only be within most of the signs you see around the city are all like that's because we suspended that we suspected right well technically and i asked you this question last time we suspended the entire science no just the special political the political sign part that was one of the things in our packet last time it was just it just addressed waving right but that's not what the mayor said in the city council meeting he said and it's recorded we have suspended our entire sign with us no we have not and that's why i asked you that question the only the resolution was to suspend is it in the section 80s was in the package 86 yes that's all of us yeah only that one one part of it right okay so in dealing with that i think if we're careful enough to say that if you're qualified 665 by the way who qualifies in the board of election supervisor elections so you can't have a political sign if we say you have to be qualified by the supervisor of elections to have a political sign in your yard then that's going to enter into this first amendment stuff saying that i can have a political sign and i'm not qualified at any time so we're wasting our time trying to put something in the ordinance that would be challenging and was challenged i agree yeah what was challenged was the 45 days yeah right right because that was the complaint somebody complained that somebody else came out earlier somebody complained that there were signs out in last year's election we went and talked to them and the people decide he was asked to put it out like five days later he took it back to his house and said it against his house and i'm sure then he came to a council meeting it was an attorney and he said you can't tell us 45 days right yes sir so that's really we can't right so we're going to be spinning our wheels if we try to put something like that into the signs [Music] yeah i agree i think all we can do is specify the size limit and then that type thing must be qualified by the i like the qualification or the director or the uh that our advisor if elections i don't know go ahead finish up well just to put a sign up for a particular office that is coming available so that from a federal election standpoint you've got primaries and i think that was the issue is this individual was running for the primary so i guess she was a qualified candidate if you're on if you're if you've been approved to be on the ballot then you you should probably be able to put your sign up anytime you want we may have to ask the city attorney if this is the sort of recommendation this is where i was headed was okay as far as how soon we can hope residents can post a sign and we're leaning towards qualified per supervisor of elections um the city attorney may have to uh determine if that violates first amendment i mean i get it you know you look russian let me be an example of my frustration as well as my wife's prime example is directly across the street and i know that the the or that portion of the ordinance was suspended there were multiple signs from the same candidate from one end of that person's property to the other that's clutter and my interpretation well what about the big banner sign that's not legal that's on this house coming over to the right that's for the lawsuit i know but that's not illegal to have a banner sign in your yard for a non-political reason yeah i know is it i didn't study to see with temporary side action so i'm looking at our current ordinance how it was written we just don't want to spend a lot of our time and energy and have somebody shooting down saying it's unconstitutional you have to go back and change it that's that's the only reason i'm to if you look giving these scenarios out yeah if you i don't anybody have section 86 65 once yep 86 what i don't know i just grabbed what i've had over the last time i've got the whole code 86 86-65 is political science permitted temporaries and then the second thing they gave us last time was the proposed 30 pages right yes from june of uh 20 yes but that's not in effect right no right so the current one just says for political science yeah and this is the part that was allowed without permit for any fee ballot issues of qualified candidates by temporary political science and private property consent to the property owner one sign per candidate well i think you could you can limit one side to them and they got size even i saw a lot of the other ordinances had sizes right well there would be there would be violations right now of multiple that's what it says that's what it says now but there's there's there's other cities that we looked at that said you could do one on one on the other street but we didn't but then there was another city that had we chose now if you had more than one sign in your yard they had to be fifteen feet apart oh jeez yeah if you kind of look at like reddington yeah reddington no that they just put up that they have a stipulation not how long in front other than the fact that it says political signs for qualified candidates for any office and in the election that's what they have many elections right okay then if you look at indian rock speech it says it doesn't really say any of that it basically says shall not extend closer to an eight feet from the curb uh they can't be bigger than signs tonight's seat six square feet per side face so they could be twelve and any sign found in violation needs to be corrected within 24 hours and the sign shall be removed uh what's this what city is that in israel no okay yeah if it's out of like if somebody put a sign like they are right now right away the city in indian rocks they just go pick them up because they aren't supposed to be in the right way because that's considered technically public property but we haven't enforced the the we've kind of stayed out of that other than the right-of-way we've stayed out of if they're on public property like if somebody put a sign on somewhere on city hall property not the right-of-way i'm talking city health property we would tell a little movie even though we don't have a political sign ordinance well it says no sign there's another section in the ordinance it doesn't say it's political it says no signs can be in the on public property so we had that issue with someone put signs on the stormwater pod over here and they they put them out there and then somebody kind of grumbled while it was done over the weekend and we came in monday we told them they needed to be removed were they inside the fence no they were down on the bank of the pond you know i mean they were still visible but that's that's public property it was out of the right way i mean if i went through the city right now i'd probably pick up a bunch i'd probably pick up there wouldn't be but maybe 20 signs left because all of them are in the right way yeah yeah all right well back okay looking at our current um code 86-65 paragraph b one it says ballot issues and qualified candidates may display temporary political science on private property got it up and then you go over here to paragraph three and it starts it says temporary political science may be displayed 45 days preceding the election or referendum day so i guess my question would be because somebody's going to probably throw this out there um [Music] you know in in b1 it says one thing in paragraph three it gets a little more defined so i guess the question would be historically the supervisor of elections would certify or approve the qualification of the candidate prior to 45 days okay so then what we've got right now as far as posting signs prior to meets that requirement and then um under b2 it will be on page six of six to the next page they may not be less than seven and one half feet from the edge of any road surface and not less than two feet from any existing sidewalk within the residential property and then you know it kind of tells you what you can do what you can't do other than i think what we had the number of signs the size one per candidate um the removal time frame is met the time limit for setting them allowing them to go up is met and it says can't be on a right away so we've got that like you said the sticking point is going to be the 45 days the way around all of it is none of it addresses if i'm a non-candidate what political sign i can put in my yard yeah right it says if you're a qualified candidate you have rules to display them but the rest of us i mean could do anything we want it basically you can put up a sign that says anything qualify camp for a candidate that's qualified or something that isn't right under the yeah you have to meet all the other requirements for temporary signs yeah right yes but if you if you break it out as a political sign and therefore it's got its own set of rules then there are no rules that apply none of that addresses me as a private citizen they only address the candidates so we really can't have people putting up all kinds of signs in the yard for no i agree we don't want that but how how do you how do we make those two things mesh without stepping you could charge a fee of a thousand dollars a sign that wouldn't minimize something like that that would create some first of all no lawsuits here [Laughter] would that be something i see your point i really do but i look at what fred did and fred really simplified it yeah yeah the political portion fred did simplify it he just said basically said you can put it up at any time and but you have to remove them 30 days after the election um it's 30 days enough i mean that's a non-political no it says you got to remove them oh the okay the proposed one because right now it says three days yeah believe it even 30 days is too long yeah i agree i think it should be so i think i i mean most of these that i've looked through they're you know they give them you know well okay what ours is to seven they don't give them yeah two to thirty yeah two days right 48 hours is the lowest one i sell yeah which is what ours used to be right ours was three days through the race yeah right but the spread yeah and he basically he summarizes you know hey we're here to protect first amendment temporary employment signs a lot about payment or fee subject to the following conditions ballot issues and qualified candidates may display temporary political signs on private property with the consent of the private property owner occupant we restrict signs to 48 inches high he didn't re strip oh there is two feet no that's seven so he didn't restrict the side though to like four square feet yeah right here that's that four square feet does he yeah paragraph two the old one was actually six square feet oh there it is i see it so you know he did numbers and then he did words so i was lost yeah so he's got four square feet size 48 inches in height not less than seven and a half feet from the edge of the road surface or two feet from any sidewalk removed within 30 days subject to two dollars per day after that penalty i saw other cities put there could be a penalty but they didn't put a dollar amount yeah i don't think anybody's ever collected on that and you know to be honest most people for the most part a day or two after the election the signs are going yeah oh yeah so the rob's point which i'd almost take take friends they are they are responsible to remove okay i take you know fred's wording and then add to rob in paragraph one of what fred did says ballot issues of qualified candidates and maybe just put in any election may display temporary political signs but you know the whole thing is is people run for federal office before they're even qualified well they can't you can't run from any office unless you qualify to run well i mean i guess they have to do the signature thing like you know the process is right for a primary yeah the primaries are early in the year they're certainly running all this and advertising while they're still gathering signatures well they have to i don't know about the federal but don't they have to pay them pay a fee or have the signatures before they can start posting signs before they even are on the ballot yeah before they're on the ballot like i went to a a veterans town hall with amanda mackey last week and she one of the things that they had there was that will you please sign the petition to get her onto the ballot that's what they were asking i got one in the mail from her yeah yeah right and so she's clearly not on the ballot yet but she is absolutely campaigning now i don't know i don't know that's a good question i don't think i've seen any signs so maybe that's it you can't until you're qualified even for the federal offices i don't think you can um yeah i haven't seen any of those yeah i haven't seen any of hers or lunas or anybody else's for that congratulations or chris yeah even though you're talking about the santas for governor yeah i haven't seen any of those right so maybe is andrew going to run with this or is fred's still going to it i'll be giving it to andy i fred's situation is kind of not last time i talked to him he was having rough times okay yeah no so i mean i agree with ron i think the recommendation would be to go with the base wording that the spread did here on page 24 and 23. i think so too and then just paragraph one to rob's point ballot issues and qualified candidates just but of any election or is it assumed it's an election i guess you don't really i agree with you i just yeah yeah i i agree with mark that we are 30 days is too long let's go with seven seven seems reasonable after the election so one sign per candidate the property okay seven days all right so let's do this okay so i can when i put these notes together for um patty so we're looking at the consensus is one sign well you basically you're taking uh fred's section 86-65 it starts on page 23. i got it yep okay so you're taking fred's 86-65 and then in paragraph one [Music] do we need to add i don't think just leave it as is yeah well people are going to interpret that to me more than one sign per candidate no no i think it's in paragraph number two because that's kind of where we had it before yeah we could add it to paragraph two so in our old sizes in our old b1 we had ballot issues qualified candidates may display temporary political signs and private property with the consent property occupant period one such side per candidate or issue shall be allowed for property there you go there you go add that to it all right paragraph one yeah okay one sign per candidate what's that per candidate before issue per property shall be allowed for property shall [Music] property okay got it two looks all right yes the only my question is seven is seven feet seven and a half feet realistic in most people's hearts well the sec now we're talking settings or are we talking this is how close i mean yeah what's the issue right well the the right away in my yard right the right of way 15 yeah yes my yard 15. yes right away so they were trying to so i think the real thing is we don't want them right up on the street you know i agree with it's seven and a half feet i think it's reasonable yeah no closer than seven and a half feet so paragraph two looks okay and in paragraph three we changed 30 days to seven days yeah i agree with that okay pair of three change 30 days to seven days it was this longboat didn't address it at all yeah indian rock says eight feet uh reddington doesn't say anything about it do we need to clarify sidewalks for those like on the gulf boulevard that's why it's two feet behind what it says it's already in there right it's not less than two feet from any existing sidewalk adjacent yeah that's in there with all the uh work sessions that this ordinance had and council sessions this audience had i mean it was crazy the conversations and the discussions and they just went round and round but we were so over you feel maybe an issue in what friend drafted with these modifications well i think some of the concept that some of the council members have said 30 pages is a lot you know and there are a lot of pictures in there and maybe what i'll do i think we suggested maintaining the old sign right ordinance and we made a few changes in the minutes to the last meeting and then take fred's wording and modify it to the old sign order just through it and then uh we'll be adding the electronic which you guys already did yeah that to it but that's the stages itself electronically what i'll be doing is whatever you come up with i'll be giving that to interim attorney to look at yeah the old over six pages so if we just modify the old one to the 65 and the changes that we gave in the last minutes right because they hit the electronics i think we addressed temporary signs we talked about like some of the construction sites how they need to come down and whatnot and then and then add the electronic piece that we did a couple meetings three meetings back yeah anybody have any other questions or comments on you know part of what makes his full draft of the sign audience or sign ordnance so long is that he goes into all these definitions and the constitution and the statutes and you know then he cites case law all because he's expecting an argument yeah which i don't think you need to have all that stuff in the ordinance no it doesn't need to be the ordinance or anything you should have it ready available to defend you right so that would shorten it by several pages yeah and so much of it doesn't apply to us because we don't have any commercial right yeah got a little scope creep but i think based on the uh listen to discussions dj i think vj and i had that uh same terminology when we talked about the bellevue estates so that's what he you kidding is whenever i see him that that was introduced to me in uh 2001 when i was working on a project for the chairman of am south bank you guys are getting scope creed cream this rated it any other questions on uh the sign ordinance discussion i i think it looks like we covered it any other business you guys want to talk about um you know um councilmember gunn brought up to me uh after committee last night that if there's anything we're seeing going on in this city you know we should raise our handle in to say let's have some conversations around it well there's i was surprised that we weren't a part of the buoy thing after the buoy meeting that where we would sit around and discuss it it got i mean sidetracked it down so many different paths first it was over here in the intercoastal waterway the discussion then it came out to the gulf where it is and where it should be but um i would think that that would have been a perfect thing for us to draw out and say okay let's make the beach things longer and cut down the number of both things and we're done but you know the the side comments that were made what i heard last night on that item 14 really disgusted me in so many ways especially about the buoys i mean i know frank has really been busting his tail you know to uh get this done and you know i guess he's kind of taking a bull by the horns and gone in certain directions without specific guidance or clearance or whatever but you know i know where his heart is on this because you know my wife and i we use the beach access by the hotel and we've seen boats come right up to the water the edge of the water well they can right now you know when they go up into the condos and get their coolers refilled and you got people out there bathing you know the other issue is you got people who want to want to uh surf fish that becomes an issue but everybody's gotta you know everybody's gotta take personal responsibility but the one thing that really bothered me was the comment was well people want to swim they just need to go to a lake oh gee give me yeah i heard that yeah i really said that yes that's a ridiculous thing to say why would anybody say that yeah i don't either especially in florida yeah somebody who lost his boat on the beach what's the point just the buoy thing i they're they're we had renewed our permit and we were fine with the way it was okay but because of the stink raised with another community it created the problem for us because we we renewed our permit bell or shore didn't renew theirs and they don't want it they don't want the buoys is that the deal 15 years so if we renewed our permit to frank's comment last night are our buoys fine they were until we got into this you know well this is illegal and this is this so now the state has told us you got to correct your buoys and it's got to be a swim zone it's got to beat the statue but until that time there was no problem there was no problem you know if unless the propeller shore doesn't want to put their buoys in that's not our issue right it's another community and you know that that's really the the gist of what the situation is and unfortunately there was a lot of how do i say that not [Music] not nice conversations so the florida fish and wildlife said the only person that's going to talk to you guys not or to the customer or banker is the lawyer and i mean they talk to me but they ain't gonna they'll it's they're done with it they're that's what he said but you know it's kind of like well if you're gonna threaten to do this to me i'm gonna yeah but that's the problem starting up with neighbors who you have been friendly with and everything worked for so long somebody's going to get upset right so so at this point i've got a call into because what frank's made it sound like last night oh we were grandfathered until we split the permit that's a really a moot point because we renewed our permit for the city of bellar beach this town of bellershore which we did the permit together 20 years ago did not want to replace our buoys well that's their prerogative we're we're replacing our permit is standing alone yeah and that's what we did and florida fish and wildlife didn't have any problem with that but i think the issue is because you got the beach access down here and it puts people in jeopardy if that's where they would congregate if you will um to do their swimming or adjacent to the north or south end of that but those buoys haven't been there for probably i'll say 10 12 years people been swimming there all that time yeah thank god there's been no accidents where where is bellar beaches boys starting at the city limit right in front of me i mean i see them yeah do we have to replace them i missed this oh right on the yeah like warning no it's got a and we were fine till we got into the okay so it's kind of like unintended consequences classic what he's saying in front of city council doesn't accurately reflect what's really happened and what's going on and yeah it's unintended consequences that's that's you know it's kind of like if you tell somebody one thing and you just think oh well this is a good idea to do this and then you find out later it's not a good idea because you know you can we don't know we have all of our buoys still north of 19th well there might be one or two that are gone but that's just from title yeah i mean and i don't know about the intercoastal i know the ones by me have all been shifted moved and yeah yeah i guess there's no rhyme or reason for those to get replaced if you scream on them yeah technically technically the booze in the intercoastal are not authorized by the current statute but the fish and wildlife people put them out with no they put them out no we didn't talk about the ones in the inner coast no we didn't city but the buoys all of them yeah oh you know back in the 90s that was so and we've replaced a few of them but the fact of the matter is you don't want to go up there and talk to them about that permit because if you start talking about that permit then they're going to start telling you blah blah blah and they told me they told me that they were honest about it they said we aren't talking to you about this permit we're talking to you about this permit and it's you know blah blah blah and i'm like the so i guess mark to your comment sounds like you fwc still is trying to define what needs to be done well their statute is already like i said the meeting the statute says if you don't have a boat ramp or a fueling thing or this you can have cannot have a i don't know wait zone that's what it says their statute it has to be you know you got to be 500 feet from a gas station well we don't need any of that qualification uh but when we renewed the permit almost two years ago and replaced the buoys that were missing we were fine until we got into the but you can't have a swim until you can yeah yeah yeah and you could have a large zone for people to pull their boats up right yeah you just have to define you just have to define or then you have to define the swimsuit horizon or vertically out from the beach not just a long line well you can go out three you have to eat yeah you have to have something is this something whether you think you just need to play out with the fwc or is it there's not much we can add to the value of the discussion it's what it is how hardcore the fwc is going to be you know i i after the comment that was made last night i'm a little concerned that some of that information was kind of misconstrued because i know what the fwc has told me yeah well i mean that's i mean why is he even presenting to fwc well that's that's what started the whole you know and putting one buoy in that that was the discussion to put one buoy at 12th street 6th street 12th street and 19th street that was the his but you can't do that and have a swim zone it's not delineated but it's not it's sixth off tall street is ours that's bella shore yeah and they are the ones that's gonna have to say yes you can do that that's what where the rub isn't or is i don't because it used to be both of us together now it's not nothing's nothing's joint anymore he went to the banker went to the bel air shore council meeting and talked to them about this right right i remember him mentioning that what answer did he get from them we're not doing we're just not gonna do it we're gonna we'll discuss it after april basically how they said they don't talk about anything no no they wait until after the election yeah it's it's kind of you know the whole i've been i you know and i've said this many times this would have been resolved if we had just waited to send a letter tell them you're going to assume if we had just waited because they were willing to talk and there was a verbal agreement to some degree but between the time that that verbal was discussed with them in the time of their next meeting they got a letter not from the mayor they got it from uh i think it was debbie paul and rick shock saying they were the sewell so when that happened their next meeting let's show everything they said we're not going to talk to you anymore right that's that's basically what happened and then the mayor decided to file a lawsuit that was probably coached by they were afraid coach to yeah the letter was sent by rick and debbie who never advised rick and debbie to send a letter i think we know that that was well i don't know who did that but all i know is that's the process that happened all right i do have another question what is there a status report you can give on the bearing of the electrical on the east side of gulf boulevard status like is anybody doing anything we're not doing anything at this point we're pulling the money to resolve that and then the recommendation of this group we'll discuss with the council of the work session very shortly about the because of that american risk we talked about taking the money budget dollar the american rescue act dollars and then repositioning the existing yeah budget dollars and putting it to that break put it into four yeah projects and what about the existing communication lines still spectrum spectrum going across the road no files isn't there it's just spectrum yeah well i think we need to get tough on them because you can get about as tough as you want you can call your supervisors you can threaten them but do you have any leverage you need leverage well there's nothing there's nothing dangerous in them if one of the tree trimmers happens to the cross wires are gone down here they're moving that way and all of them are going to be gone oh great and anything on the west side that spectrum is going to be gone the east side there's there's about 180 thousand dollars we have to pay in for the east side but from first through 12th everything will be going on both sides of the street and they're there they told me this end i met with them i don't know a week 10 days ago they told me by the 15th they'll have a better situation part of the problem spectrum too is it's like you start with this guy and then it's another guy that's another guy that's another guy you know there's no uh what you want to call it uh there's no continuity and there's no that makes them do anything it's kind of like dude there's no utility their utility and there's nothing in any of the public service commission that you can force them to do it you know like we can do a contract with our like the next one that's out to bid for 12th and 13th street i i got a stipulation in there that says 90 days utility there's nothing that you could do that with yeah what is this work that got done down here uh there was a kind of like a little bit of sinkhole and they repaired it and that's where the hole was at the sidewalk that i called you about and nothing happened i called the utilities and nothing happened and i was about ready to call the county commissioner and say you need to light a fire under somebody before somebody gets hurt and we call them too i'm sure you did what did they put in a new they put it in a new manhole looked like an hole some piping piping and everything i they buy sewer or water or was it an update to sewer water it was uh yeah well they paved and striked they're getting close to being done with it because they're done they're very close yeah well they paid not all of it well they got the curb still to do yeah i'm a little surprised that they paved without putting the car back first exactly but i was also wondering why would they plan to do it at the start of spring break yeah they've been this weekend they moved to a contractor and the contractor said i can do it and then they told him to go ahead and if they get it done this week that'll be good because next week next week is going to be hillsborough county pinellas county pasco manatee and you got yeah fsu ucf and usa [Music] yeah so at least it'll be done by then no it should be done this is a few days yeah um they've got the side down there already really quick the other topic we talked about was the resident from bel air island estates about the edges and everything where's the city council on that that's where we're going to take towards yeah he mentioned earlier it's going to go to the woodwork session oh okay so is that the it's tom ferrara oh i thought it was yeah 12 foot back yeah that's what they want to do okay well he wanted to go back to the original 25 yeah yeah and then again the reason was is that's the the minimum setback for a pool was 12 feet from the seawall okay but was there any talk about grandfathered in or are you gonna you have to everybody on the water has to go and trim everything that's kind of gonna be up to i guess the city council and you know how that's gonna go where let's just say we're not going to go tell somebody because they're hedges unless there's a complaint a message unless the people who are that's that's or it's impeding the roadway or the house is sold then we're going to tell you that you have to no co ah no co well until right high vote the okay yeah yeah we are gonna uh that that's how we've done it with in the past and then we told the people that you know there's a house just around the corner from you they had to cut the heads before this that was the one yeah they had to kind of up front they had to cut them up front right which looks great now yeah wow why don't we cut mine out front i went back my wife and i it's been a few weeks but we drove back there just to see how things were going you know because we see all the construction equipment and everything and i tell you there was there's some residents back there that that four foot from the the gutter if you will the rain gutter back some of them's a little bit higher than four foot and they're a little bit shorter than they need to be cold enforcement have a holiday back there four foot yeah you know if you got shrubbery um down your property line like a natural fence if you will i think the the maximum height yeah i think there are some tree hedges yeah supposed to be a certain height and it's got to be that height so far back six six feet back and forth i think about those palms there yeah yeah yeah it depends yeah some situations for that piece of code help when you're backing out of your driveway and see if there's people walking down the street or somebody turned up i can tell you there's been a couple of times because with me on 22nd i historically go down 21st okay so i make i slow down for the term i'm checking to make sure there's nobody coming or going or whatever nobody in the bike path so i slow down to go around that corner and the guy that lives on the first house in not the one right on the corner his head went all the way down and i can't tell i've lost count a number of times he's backing out of the driveway and we've almost collided yeah and i'm not like i said i slow down for turns that's old habit drive a fixture like two wheel turns just take it on two wheels i could do that at two wheels but i'm i'm still my wife tells me he says you're not driving the 18 wheeler no more i did pull the stunt one time though up in a house somewhere i wanted to see what a trailer did under snow and ice i got to wear a distribution warehouse the parking lot was just completely open going back there so i got out there and i wasn't going all that fast and um locked up the brakes and i just locked them brakes up and i started looking for mirrors and next thing you know that trailer's coming around and bite you in the ass trailer gets in front of you it's a problem that's a big kind of problem so then you know take get off the taillight of the dog get off the accelerator and she straightens out and then of course i remember the training in a situation like that too we call it the trolley brake because you there's a handle on a steering column that you can pull and it'll engage your trailer brakes before your tractor brakes without touching the brake pedal on a tractor that's before i moved into the office and became a personnel manager i start it's like everything i've done in my life seriously it's like everything i've done in my life i've started from the bottom and worked my way up all right well we're coming right at you let's make questions to discuss i'm going to move to we adjourn okay second set all favor all right"
