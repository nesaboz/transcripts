    "transcript": "me to conduct our Town's business we thank you for your blessings that you so graciously provide to us we ask that you give us wisdom and knowledge so that the decisions we make will be according to your will Amen to the flag of the United States of America and to the rep for it stands one nation God indivisible with liy and justice for all thank you okay councel under item five open form public comment is there anyone who has not signed up that wants to speak under open form okay real quick some guidelines the council shall provide at least one period of public comment per month during a regular meeting unless no regular meeting is held that month any individual or group that wishes to address the council shall inform the town clerk anytime prior to the start of the meeting and provide their name address and subject matter about which they wish to speak persones must be present if they wish to address counsel and comments to five minutes per speaker I also ask that you put your mobile devices on vibrate or silent or mute while in session okay first person I have is Mr Edie per hello Eddie Peru 1312 Laurel Street and I just was thinking on the Ware that's a seventh home I paid taxes on here in the town um hope you enjoy the next few minutes because I've got nothing but positive things to say I want to thank you people for all the work you've done when you think about the LA last 6 months you've accomplished a lot you should be proud of it and I really appreciate how hard y'all are working I've never seen a council have more meetings more committee meetings and uh work on more uh things in a short period of time uh some of the things you've gotten done already is you had a first ever strategic planning session here in vales where the Cog assisted you with find out what a Citizens really think is important in our town and I see yall five of y'all taking action to fulfill what the citizens have asked for you established three citizens committees and I'd really like to thank what's going on at the facilities committee and also the drug and homeless committee where I see much progress being made on both of those committees we had a situation where the pool bubble that we knew everyone in town knew for a long long time it was a problem it had been kicked down the road nothing had gotten done and in short order this Council the five of you folks came together came up with a good solution and maybe by November December January whatever it takes we're going to have a lot better facility at the rec department as far as the pool goes than we've ever had um I just said to David Anderson a few minutes ago when I'd go in that bubble look around it was depressing it like you couldn't see anything it it just was nothing compared to what you're going to get done and I appreciate all of y'all's efforts to try to come up with a solution that'll help the citizens for many years to come also the Rock School renovation is being done and if anybody's been there you can see what wonderful work's going on you should be proud of yourself for doing that for taken on that project and we want to thank Marissa for the effort she put in getting the grant and overseeing the project as it started we didn't know if we'd get new seats we or not and now we're going to and there's just a lot more getting done than we originally thought was going to get done so there again thank you Council that's great also uh you fired an architect that seemed to be able to get nothing done after two or three years on a building that was really going to be built in the wrong place so what did you do as a council you have bought land that I think every fireman and every policeman in town as well as the citizens would say is in a better place than pineur so thank you for having the foresight to buy that land which will be close by here and we can get a facility put there you also hired a new police chief I've lived here on and off most of my life and I haven't heard one negative comment about our new uh police chief he's here tonight he's doing a great job rather than say we don't have a homeless and drug problem he is working with the committee to do something about that so I congratulate you on hiring him in short order and getting the right person for this important job also want to talk to you about the fact that most politicians talk about doing things and never do them but it does look like you're lowering the tax rate and you're balancing the budget as far as I can tell we'll find out tonight but last year even with the horrendous tax increase you still dipped into the funds for 238,000 it looks like you're not going to do that this year you've also given I understand going to give raises to employees which is much needed much deserved and I appreciate your efforts and I'm sure all the employees do as well we have a lot of great employees we need to keep them I understand you're also looking into Paving more miles I mean getting more miles per dollar paid by looking into the do doing some of that and the great thing too is that people said you can't lower the tax rate without cutting services or getting rid of people but correct me if I'm wrong nobody's been fired and this Council doesn't really seem to intend to fire people like other people might say so for me I'm really pleased with the direction the trajectory the town is going on and in the words of the Rowan Stones You Can't Always Get What You Want You Can't Always Get You Want but if you try sometime you just might find you'll get what you need okay mram come out hello everybody uh my name is aam Camal 329 North Ro Street I live on the famous street that always has sewer problems the last one was Miss Kaplan uh currently it's our house uh our backyard has been um demolished to get into the find out what's going on we have a manhole in our backyard we have pulled uh towels shirts out of our basement currently we have three plugs that the plumber put in um over the toilet in the basement the shower and the drain we cannot use any of that stuff it's plugged up with this yellow I can't I don't even know what it's going called but um I talked to Allan um I know there is a CIP is that the right uh acronym that needs to go through approvals and all that but that's two threee uh problem in the meantime I have a plumber who needs to know what to do with this manhole sitting in the back porch and potential nothing against Nationwide they we didn't have a riter to cover the cleanup and the fixes because but we did add it but I'm afraid now it's the same issue if it happens again is it is it grandfather then is it ignored because it's the same issue it might happen again I can't we can't wait two years we got to get it fixed now and it is a mess in our yard right now it's a total mess um and we can't we started we got to go ahead to start using our washing machine and and and uh because we couldn't earlier it always backed up so um I just need the town's help to figure out what to do um that's why I'm here uh I got two two minutes and 57 seconds but that's all I got so thank you thank you okay I have no others signed up to speak during open Forum moving on to consent agenda there is no consent items to be considered we'll move on to item seven new business first item a is a uh public hearing and at this time Council will call for the public hearing on the 2425 budget public hearing and ordinance adoption since this is a public hearing I'll now declare the public hearing open and ask for Boer or our manager to come forward please thank you Mr Mayor members of council I don't know if you want to allow public to speak first or if you would like me and Bo to say a few things y'all go ahead Mr Mayor excuse me may I make a request could we clarify for the attendees if there is the possibility of making any amendments changes to the budget before we adopt it tonight or is this just uh for future consideration this is for the adoption of the proposed 2425 budget yeah I think the citizens would like to know if they comment and have a request such as we heard one that may have to do with sewers but if they have a request is that something we can if there's a problem if there's a need is that something we can deal with tonight or is that something that must it can be in the future it'll have to be in the future no changes tonight no all right thank you Mr Mayor folks you know we've had several meetings and worked through the budget with the council and um there were opportunities for input from council members and when we had a consensus of council we made those changes and those reflected all those changes in what is now the budget ordinance or the budget for the coming year here and if you'd like him to to go into some details or if there are questions Council might have be glad to try and answer them Council you have questions okay hearing none thank you are there any members of the public who would wish to address the uh budget ordinance miss ciso you would be first since you signed up ma'am Karen Caruso 805 Michael Avenue um before I begin I would like to make sure I understand as well so there will be no changes to the budget correct as presented tonight okay it is possible to make modification before it's voted on that would require an additional meeting is that I think that would depend on what the modification is and whether or not Bo and our manager need time to react to it it could require us to continue to another meeting before the actual budget as modified is voted on by Council thank you for that clarification because if changes were not permissible then my comments would be moved so thank you uh good evening mayor and counsel I'm here to ask you to approve the 5% employee pay increase in the proposed FY 2425 budget please consider these reasons inflation continues to erode purchasing power and has for several years the latest unemployment rate for Berke county is at the lowest rate it's been this calendar year competition for employees among local and state governments is not going away your own strategic plan places a priority on employee retention and employees shouldn't have to fund their own training the Consumer Price Index or CPI measure measures the change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services the annual CPI for 2021 was 7% in the FY 2122 two budget Town employees received a 2% pay increase the 2022 CPI was 65% employees received a 5% increase in the FY 2223 budget CPI in 2023 came down to a 4.1% and employees received a 5% increase in the FY 2324 budget these CPI numbers include prices for food but anyone who goes to the grocery store knows when food is broken out of these numbers by themselves The increased in cost is well above these percentages you can get by without without buying a lot of things but food is not one of them at the last council meeting it was heartbreaking to hear that a citizen witness Town employees receiving food assistant from area Church Ministries full employment is generally considered to be an unemployment rate of 5% or lower some economists questioned this and suggested that it should be 3% last month the unemployment rate for Burke County was 3.1% that's full uh employment by most Economist standards and indicates that anyone who really wants a job is likely able to find one it also means it's easier for those with jobs to find another one if they're not satisfied with their current employment situation you can bet all the municipalities in the unior and the state institutions in Morganton are aware of the competition for good employees Western pedmont Community College has 10 full-time positions available there are nearly 100 full-time state job openings at various facilities in Morganton a quick look for full-time munic Municipal jobs shows multiple openings in morgon Burke County and Hickory some of these positions even include generous signing bonuses but the competition for our folks is definitely not limited to governmental entities the private sector is much larger and they have deeper Pockets employee retention emerged as a key priority of your SWAT analysis during the Strategic plan process support your own plan by giving the town's most important asset competitive pay the Optics the Optics of not doing so are going to be very poor on the heels of giving yourself a huge raise at the last council meeting I'm all for employee training and think it's a great idea but don't do it on the backs of employees by reducing their pay increase to fund it the Strategic plan mandates that you must do your part to retain our experienced dedicated employees who serve us so well please do not erode your employees buying power further and continue to force them into seeking food assistance vote Yes for the uh 5% pay increase thank you thank you is there anyone else who wishes to speak hearing none then I will declare the public hearing closed Mr Mayor I have some questions for the uh manager now if I might about the budget go ahead I was I was told we were have a few charts presented but we're not going to do that or we are are we or are we not yes we are I got a small presentation pardon I got a small presentation we can do oh okay I I didn't know I thought you know would have been nice to have that before the hearing perhaps but just two or three things real quickly what what cost of living increases in this budget 5% five thank you is there a training uh allocation as well yes sir how much 25,000 30,000 including police oh 30, I'm sorry all right have any essential service has been cut not that I'm aware of thank you you still want to do the presentation coun anyone else have questions it's just going to be a recap okay okay all right so just kind of give an overview of of what we're doing here tonight so fund G categories that Val uses so these are North Carolina um statute based budgeting tools that we use um in in North Carolina so annual budget ordinance is one type and then we also have a capital project ordinance the difference between the two is the capital projects we heard that that word a lot those funds Remain the life of the project so we don't have to renew it every year whereas the annual budget ordinance which we're talking about tonight those funds expire at June 30th every year so that's why we have to adopt a new uh budget before June 30th Under the Umbrella of each of these the annual budget ordinance is a general fund and water and sewer Fund in vales so remember the general fund is supported by taxes and then our water and sewer fund is supported by the sales of utilities uh mainly Water and Wastewater under Capital project ordinance we have the capital project funds so these aren't all our funds onen here but I've put a few samples and these are all either supported by the general fund contributions Utility Fund contribution grants things like that so you got the pool structure the uh public safety building those are all capital projects that fall under this so once that project is established by Council that's the end of it until the until that project is done then I close it out we don't have to renew a budget every year for it but what we're doing here tonight is focusing on a general fund and a water and sewer fund so that's our annual budget ordinance that we want to get adopted so I'm just going to run through some highlights of the general fund and we'll do a few highlights of the utility and just answer some questions if anybody has any so for the uh general fund budget we're looking at $7.6 million budget so that's a balanced budget between revenues and expenditures it includes a 41.5 cent tax rate in the budget includes $500,000 for Street resurfacing there's a $2 recycling fee increase our two top Revenue sources in the Jal fund are property taxes so we're looking at about 2.2 million for that and then uh sales taxes so any any food or items are purchased at $1.8 million so remember sales taxes happens anywhere in Berke County so as long as the purchas is being made within Burke County we get a cut of those sales taxes debt represents 3% of the total expenditure so 3% of that $7.6 million budget uh is allocated to Debt Service payment we have $25,000 in there for townwide training as you heard a little bit ago additional 5,000 for police and then some Capital Investments I didn't put them all here but just some of the highlights uh we have bowling center upgrades in the budget at the parks and rec center uh Clock Tower repairs downtown and then uh some Public Safety Vehicles including a met medic truck and a patrol car so that's it for I got for general fund is there any questions on the general fund side Council instead of trying to go through every number and stuff I thought this might be a little more interactive that's Ahad to utilities okay so Water and Sewer fund this budget we're looking at $6.8 million a balance budget between revenues and expenditures and just to note that we this budget serves about 5,450 customers top Revenue sources uh easy to guess here Residential Water sales and Sewer discharge so about 3 and a half million for water and 1 and a half million for sewer so we have a zero increase for inside water rates SE base fee will increase $2.50 per month and then there's a 1 and a half multiplier built in to outside water rate so we look at the inside rate which is going to be $38.50 so that's remaining the same multiply that by one and a half so that gives you your outside rate of 5775 uh something new for this year the the old triple Community customer base uh will now be included with the outside customer rate so that one half multiplier debt represents 5% of the expenditures and then some Capital Investments that included with this budget are water plant replacing the air actuated valve operators uh also over at the water plant upgrading the booster station and tank to lemetry the Wastewater PL uh getting iteration based in upgrades and under the water and distribution Department uh is replacing a jeder system to help clean out the sewer lines so any questions on that just a couple please okay we have uh 5450 outside customers roughly how many inside customers do we have 5450 is all our customers combined oh okay yeah and it split we have about 2200 inside and and the remaining are outside roughly half and half so a little more on the outside correct so VES is providing water to more than the number of people we have using it yes sir got it uh one more if uh if uh this this uh fund supports itself through fees right if there's a crash of some type uh the River dries up cuz Charlotte took all our water or uh our water plant crashes and we can no longer sell water outside we'd have to limit it to just all these residents we end up with uh a big chunk of uh debt who's responsible for that debt the town would be responsible for it thank you taxpayers in the end um end ultimately I guess if you want to look it that way it could be yeah okay yeah thank okay I got one more slide Bo I've got a question oh yeah yeah so the general fund uh we have 3% of expenditures and Utility Fund is 5% so looking down the road at you future needs for facilities you know most importantly the police and fire uh facilities are we in good position to take on additional debt obligations if need be I think we could handle something like that um you 3% of a six 7.6 million budgets our our payment is 234,000 a year so that's a very small percentage of our general fund so you feel comfortable with our debt um load obligations I mean we're it's pretty low compared to our total expenditures yeah um that would be a council decision though okay all right one more slide so what's next so um the next next few minutes Council decid in adopting the budget once that happens between tonight and the end of the month I'll be keying all these budget numbers into the accounting system June 30th our current budget numbers expire the next day July 1st the new budget opens so that's why I got to have these numbers keyed in so that new budget opens and then between August October those time frames we get an audit on the current budget that we're in right now and the financial transactions as happened during this budget year so then the whole process starts over again after October we start the whole new budget so but I just want to give you an overview of what's what's kind of the process and what's next okay okay two more questions please real quick one the most important one will this 41.5 Cent tax rate be implemented by by the Burke County when they collect our taxes and send our bills out next month yes sir okay second one could you elaborate just a little bit on our Reserve funds where they are uh what how how much we have uh how they're invested how they return uh income to us yeah so the general fund reserves um we last year we ended around 6.6 million um our revenues projected at we're looking at to the end of May so projected revenues are going to be about uh I think of 675,000 over expenditures so we're going to have a surplus there throughout this past budget year um we've pulled about 73,000 out of fund balance to supply um some projects and stuff and I got a detailed sheet if we need to see that but included things like the Strategic plan iner manager things things like that so those two two almost balance each other out they wash so I'm still projecting and estimating of course the Auditors do a real measurement on June 30th what our fund reserves are but I'm thinking we're going to be around that stay around that 6.6 million Mark which is good after pulling out 700,000 over the past year so that's good there um far as what we we do with those funds we maximize our investments as much as possible um I keep about two weeks worth of operating money in our checking account just enough to pay the bills the rest of it we get we invest um and some liquid Investments and we're very limited on what we can do as far as North Carolina laws um we use the right now we're using the Capital Management trust as an outside advisor to help with those Investments but they're liquid so I transfer in and out so that as we need the money we can bring it in if we have excess in our checking account I send it back out to be invested our current rate of return is 5.21% um I'm hoping last two months I think two months ago Council approved us going with another outside firm called NC class I don't remember what AC stands for it's kind of long their rate of returns slightly higher so I'm going to try to diversify to them as well I just haven't had time with budget things going on to to finalize all the paperwork and stuff on that end but so I guess big picture of the 6.6 million we're investing as much as we can so we can get that rate to return in and that's actually helped out a lot having that 675,000 of revenues over expenditures um I think about 500,000 500,000 of that was unexpected interest income so so it was unexpected why I'm sorry just interest income that we we've gained because we're we're pushing now Investments as much as we can so we ended up with how much interest income this year um I can't remember exactly but I think it's going to be we're going to end up around 600,000 and how much are we budgeting next year um I think it's 300,000 because we just don't know what the markets are going to do no the interest income next year in this I have to I have to take a look but I can't remember at 243,000 okay 243 okay is there a little margin of opportunity there that we may end up not having less interest income in the next 12 months than we had in the last 12 it it's yeah I can't predict the future so um we could have the same amount which I hope for but we want to be conservative so that's why we have 243 built into the budget what could happen to drop it in more than half would it be Anything Could Happen uh I I don't you think banks are going to cut race in half in the next 12 months I I can't predict it I don't know I'm not an economist so I'm sorry our economists are not predicting that but we don't have to that's fine it's good to have a little cushion and it looks to me like we might have3 $400,000 cushion there is that possible I hope so okay yeah thank you okay any other questions on the budget Council hearing none then I'll entertain a motion to adopt the 2425 budget ordinance as proposed and if who when you make your motion if you would include all four of those items that's listed under a and we'll do it in one motion I'd love to make that motion if I might anyone had any questions and I appreciate that clear presentation we had and that information was very helpful and I'm sure our citizens appreciate it as well so I therefore move and I don't have the right wording here but that we adopt the fiscal year 2024 25 budget public hearing budget as presented including the adoption of the fiscal year 2425 fee schedules adoption of the fiscal year 2425 general fund capital approv plan adoption of the fiscal year 2425 utility Capital Improvement plan and Adoption of the budget ordinance okay second thank you have a motion of second any further discussion Mr Mayor i' just like to make a comment um this has been a lot of hard work we put in a lot of hours and time in working out this year's budget and I compliment the Council on the hard work that they've done and also Bo and Brian on their their guidance but I think we've you know it's been give and take and I really just wanted to compliment everyone on the hard work that they absolutely I appreciate the hard work that all the council's put in and Bo you and Brian thank you and the department heads okay all those in favor signify by saying yes and raising your right hand yes yes seeing none opposed motion carries okay Item B Facilities Review Committee report I'm Rog re Greg R for we're co-chairs of the facility committee and uh just a short update on the public safety facilities last week we a site visit to the public safety building by tally and Smith architectural firm this is a group that has hired we've hired to develop a new public saf facilities this tour was conducted by fire chief Truman Walton and police chief Mark Shar as in previous inspection by several engineering and architect tal firms has been suggested fire and police officers be relocated to a different facility the reason being the walls are deteriorating and creating a potentially dangerous condition this coupled with the fact that it's probably going to take two years to complete the new facilities there are several potential locations in the valley to fill these needs after looking at different locations is being recommended by facil reiew committee the Old Town Hall be renovated for temporary fire and police offices there are numerous reasons for this some of which being close proximity to all police and fire facilities such as Armory computer equipment trucks and available parking once new Public Safety facilities are completed this Old Town Hall will become very markable as a potential lease or sale property these Capital Improvements will only enhance this property this time is there any questions from the council or comments questions councel is there enough um I'll ask is there enough room for both groups in the old town hall facility and the I know there are certain uh requirements for a public safety for the police particularly and will we have um the things that are needed for the police department to be functional that's up to architectural firm we feel like that's a good a true statement that there's room there's there's more room there they aree in the police Police Department their offices okay there is more room right it's actually about twice as much space okay you know when you're talking about the Old Town Hall if you look at the the building the far it's over there to the left cor yes okay and that needs to be renovated it's going to to be renovated it's going to have to have ceiling tiles drywall floors bathrooms but it's one AC unit ac y recommending that police and fire both go into that building right okay and there's enough room for offices and that yes they've already got a lot of cilities there now and they'll be close to the Armory and their computers uh you know internet and all that stuff they'll have their Network they'll be all close to that and trucks and everything so and that will get them out of the current police chief's office yes Police and Fire Chiefs and that is counting both floors I guess there's two okay there's two floors Vis that there there is a lot of room in that building upstairs and downstairs there's no question and once we get it renovated I mean it be be a marketable for release or maybe a sale or whatever but uh you know it's it's probably the best option we have to get them out of the existing town I mean Fire Police Department evidence room there's room for evidence room and keeping um see they can keep all that all that stuff in already existing offices okay so okay so you leave that stuff over is now whatever's whatever be safe yeah probably the Armory and they can leave all there people people's what we looking at moving people excellent my my question is this and being familiar with the codes and Ocea regulations if we evacuate our people because the the architect that's what he said that correct that was my understanding if we evacuate our people and they still have to go back in that building for for supplies or to to get to the Armory or to get to our the town the town's uh all over the town's it equipment is in that building that controls our phones and everything and we have to have uh maintenance Personnel like they want to work on the phone system or the computers in there what challenge does that present to us well Excuse excuse me we're I think we're getting the questions ahead of of the uh horse the architect and engineering firm has not yet come into that building with their engineering staff have not sat down with the police chief and the fire chief to identify exactly what the needs are and what the opportunities are so we I think the committee just gave a report of what we learned last Thursday and now we're we're letting people know we're moving ahead and as fast as we can we need to get together the uh police chief the fire chief the architect he's got an Engineering Services firm he's going to bring in and they're going to analyze this okay find out what it's going to take this was just this was just a recommendation okay okay that's what I was thinking we were going to move on this thank you thank you he said they recommend that we move the police and fire out it's not a catastrophic event he said it's a recommendation okay thank you thank you so the police and fire chief will have input on this process absolutely well I also know that the uh uh efficiency task force recommended using part of this building for police and or fire well it's it's like I said we've got several options yeah there are seever and that that also would be an option right that we could look at uh as you look at the number of people I'm not sure eight or nine people here with this large facility that we have I think it's very visible that we are visible or visible whatever the word uh that we can use this building but it's you know you got it's in close proximity to their existing facilities now so it you know it's got several options look at and so this would be at least for now it' be a temporary Sol probably a twoyear process because probably going to take two years to build a building so it's probably two-year process okay but we'll still meet with the police and fire chief and the committee and our just a start okay thank you Roger I appreciate everybody M police chief and the fire chief have been copied on every communication on this project theyve been every meeting you know so we're we're working with them I just want to ensure they have their input they we've been working with them I appreciate you all what you're doing thank you we do thank you okay Street Paving updates Mr Hudson let's good evening mayor and counsel um as you you had in your packet the uh the street Paving panel we come up with a A list of streets which was uh 30 streets that has been sent to do and got back some information from them wording that uh by the end of the month first July we should have some numbers in and then we would be able to go forward from there as far as what we can or can't do with the with the numbers and pricing um it I mean just depends on how they come back got a email today that you know once we get those and then we can meet with the uh the contractors and the the supplemental agreements and things like that but once we get the numbers back uh we'll know more about which which direction or what we can do in the footage or the mileage that we'd be able to do sounds good Council questions uh if I if I might uh thank thank you alen alen's done a lot of work on this which is great uh the old school teacher in me and the old incurable planner just throw out a couple of things our our budget this year for repaving is $500,000 our budget last year for repaving was $500,000 last year the town repaved 1 3 four miles of streets based on the preliminary estimates using Do's numbers uh do would be able to PVE 2.4 miles of streets for $500,000 that's not quite twice as much but a significantly greater amount uh on top of that doot would handle the entire project they would manage it from beginning to end uh so that leaves the council then in the future when we get these numbers back for all these it's actually 32 streets if you add those 32 streets up which I did it's 7.36 miles Al together 32 streets if you look at that list that covers a lot of Val but it's only 73. 36 miles it's still only 1 fth of our streets the total cost using Do's estimates for that is one and a half million but if we rounded it down to uh five miles of streets that would be a million dollars that would be the equivalent of this year's allocation for Paving plus one more year or if you went to six miles it would be $14 million or for all seven miles well for seven miles it's one and a half million so I think I just want to put out to the council and to the citizens because I think when citizens see this list of 32 streets they're going to say oh my list my Street's on here but we have to make some decisions and one of the decisions the town's going to have to make is do we limit our Paving this year to $500,000 and 2.4 miles still almost twice as much as we did last year but do we limit it to that or do we consider what it might cost to borrow enough money to do two years or three years of paving at this time under current costs will we save more on the potential increase in the cost of asphalt and Paving if we spend a little money borrowing money or one other possibility is we saw that we have about $6 million in our Reserves the town has the option and it has done it in the past it did it three years ago to borrow money from the reserves and then pay it back for the next three or four years or whatever length of time it takes out of the power bill funds that we receive each year to use for piding so it's a it's a it's a very optimistic picture and an opportunity and the question that's going to come down to the council is do we want to do we want to stand ourselves as Private Industry might by investing in the future or do we want to just continue pay as we go or pay as as pile Bill funds let us go so I just want to try to make that clear but the choices are again last year this past year we did 1.3 miles of streets for a half a million dollars this year dots estimating we could do 2.4 miles for half million doll and we could do all 32 streets for a little over a million and a half if we could come up with a creative way to raise another million dollars yeah and I have it broke up into into four segments based on the preliminary pricing uh we could do you know five streets 10 streets 15 or the 32 streets and I've got those broken down into different pricing right per mile of of what those would be but like I said that's just from the preliminary pricing once they get the other pricing to to a more closer number then I can break it down into and may add some or have to take some off so it just depends on what the pricing is when I get it back to what we can do and then it'll be up to y'all's decision how y'all want to do it and what what we want to do okay great effort thank you thank you very much we just don't want to get into feuds and with the people on Tron Avenue feuding with the people on Harris Avenue because the street got they doesn't get so thank you Council anyone else thank you Alan okay item D consideration of local Realtors listing Town own properties Mr stain sir yes Mr mayor council members uh some weeks ago we were talking about this y'all instruct us to reach out to our real estate agents in the area here in Valdes so I did I sent out the document to them asked them to fill it out and return it to me of the four companies we've had two that actually returned responses and they you should have those in your agenda packet so I just need direction on which firm or what y'all would like to do would this it's like a motion on this action we need to decide which firm we want to go with I'm sorry we need to decide which realy firm we want to go with well that emotionally do that I guess uh I look I looked at these two I it was really it was great that two of our local longstanding reers are willing to help the town and and try to get the best uh possible sale price from this land that we do not use there are vacant Parcels not necessarily Prime Building spots so they're going to need some marketing uh two of the real estate firms came forward with proposals uh the uh they talked about what their fees would be and they talked about uh Hollywood Market them and they gave the re the history of the number of listings and sales they've had in the last uh two years uh the one with the U least restrictions and the most sales would be uh Thompson realy and as I went through them I checked off pluses I mean I just counted up the pluses on each one I thought Thompson reality had uh the most check marks on my list so I'd like to move that we engage Tom sterility for that uh if if there's a second any further discussion anybody wants to suggest something alternative I'm fine with that too okay I have a motion second thank you any further discussion is it possible that we could use both firms and divide the properties in half is that a possibility yeah I I think uh I think we need to look at at all or both there's no question I don't think we need to limit oursel to one well I'm sorry I we only we only have about five sailable properties uh they're not prime properties we're not talking about million dollars wor property here we're talking about $100,000 $200,000 of a property for if you if one of these firms goes out and markets some they're going to spend some money on that I don't know how you could two of them could justify doing that there's one other difference one of them has a minimum fee of $1,500 minimum listing fee the other one has no minimum listing fee so that could be a problem you know if we have if we have to end up selling one for $5,000 the fee would be $400 time and have to pay $1,100 extra for the listing fee so I think we ought to go with the better of the two options that's why I made the selection I did an a motion I I agree I don't see that there's enough property there to involve two realy companies yeah any further discussion okay those in favor of employing Thompson realy to take care of our vacant property signify by raising your right hand and stating yes yes seeing none opposed motion carries thank you Council okay item e consideration of encroachment agreement town rideway with Cana Ultra Broadband LLC Mr Johnson good evening Mr Mayor and counsel uh this should be brief um a local business that has relocated into the old curtsy Funeral Home Building uh Kataba Valley Health care uh they're seeking fiber and uh Cana has aligned along Main Street and they're seeking uh to connect to their uh the fiber to their business and I'm just here to present and ask for approval of the encroachment agreement to allow that business to get fiber to to their operation it's approximately 108 ft it's along morgon Street uh Cana has complied with all of our requirements and encroachment agreement liability insurance performance guarantee uh pretty much anything we have asked them for they have provided so only thing I'm asking this evening is that you just uh approve the the encroachment agreement so that uh Kataba Valley Healthcare can can get U fiber to to the to the location simply put Council questions I have a few from my great interest in Broadband uh internet capabilities is is this what this this is a fiber optic cable is that right that is correct Cana has a fiber optic cable that runs along Main Street that was installed years ago matter of fact I think as you know uh I think I informed you in an early conversation uh the town of valis is also connected to uh Cana by through fiber so Cana would have how much cable already installed under the I can't speak in terms to the linear footage of cable already installed I can tell you that it is installed along Main Street and I believe it even extends all the way to ruford college and possibly to the hospital possibly connecting the two hospitals possibly yes sir now are they so they've been around for a while uh did do we have any problem with the installations they did in the past no sir and of course I've been around a while too but uh you would know that's the reason I that's the reason when I looked up Cana I found out that they're based they're based in Charlotte they're a multi-billion dollar fil and we haven't had any problems with them though and how many miles of uh underground encroachment are they going to be doing here um not miles feet uh footage uh 108 ft 108 ft yes sir just from the intersection of of Morgan Street right there Jack B quick just back to one 108 ft to the property line or to the property where the business is loc being located or Curr Crossing very many streets no sir just running uh along Morgan Street okay now how what can we do to make sure they fix it up repair the way they as indicated U as I indicated in my presentation they have provided a performance bond okay uh to do that of course they also have liability insurance which where which they also signed off on any and everything that we're required to them uh required of them to ensure that they do the appropriate job or where about Council wouldn't be getting calls or even if they're given the length of this line uh they have they have done so we have a performance uh bond that for $10,000 uh just run 108 ft a performance B of how much $10,000 $10,000 yes sir for 100 ft yes sir I hate to ask this question when I have to go for it this is the elephant question in the room always this huge multi-billion dollar company that's been in vales for years and CA no they've have they've not torn up any streets that we know of that we remember they're going to encroach 108 ft of of our Earth to move to to connect two fiber points and we are forcing them to spend the money for a $10,000 performance bond versus a startup company that has cut up 35 miles of our streets with no uh with with no leverage whatsoever to ensure they finish them so I know I don't expect you to answer that question but that's a hypothetical question I'll answer the question you may not agree with the answer but I'll answer the question your question is why would we allow someone go through a a new company startup company go through a no that's not my question my question why did we not require a year ago that's my question if you want to answer the question that's the question I can't speak to a year ago because I wasn't I wasn't well let if I may answer the reason I can't answer that question was because I wasn't part of the decisionmaking process uh to allow Foothills but I am involved in Cera thank you and that is that is the reason thank you okay anybody else okay I'll entertain a motion to approve the encroachment agreement with Cana Ultra Broadband Mr Mayor I'd like to make a motion to approve the encroachment agreement with Cana Ultra Broadband LLC okay second I second it okay any further discussion those in favor signify basing right hand stating yes yes SE none opposed motion carries thank you Mr mayor council Larry okay manager report sirry thank you Mr Mayor you have several items um first family Friday nights continue each Friday in June on Temple field from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. uh B special called meeting scheduled for Friday June 21st 2024 at 8:45 a.m. at Val town hall to go

council meeting is scheduled for Monday July 29th 2024 at 6m in council chambers here at the Valdes town hall and item e next regular council meeting scheduled for Monday August 5th 2024 at 6m in council chambers here in Valdes Town Hall okay thank you sir Council any comments I may have a couple always but I don't want to go first if anybody else wishes to speak have it it well thank you uh first of all I want to I want to thank everybody for tolerating the amount of change we've experienced this year I thank the citizens who came forward and participated in uh in uh strategic planning effort and helped us set the priorities for the year uh I I thank the citizens who stepped forward even further and agreed to serve on committees uh I thank the staff for hanging in there and doing all their hard work and as somebody mentioned earlier this evening in spite of what you heard for the last prior six months nobody got fired uh and especially the message to all the people that we heard from who were suffering under their tax bills last year uh the good news the good news is that you're getting a 20% cut when you receive your 2024 Bill 20% cut in the Val tax rate Burke County rate's the same as it was last year as far as I know but you're a 20% cut in your Bel e tax rate the good news along with that is there were no cut and services and the great news for all the people who feel we should not we did not need that tax cut is you can take that 20% that you sa please write a check to the town and designate on it what you'd like to go for you can support the old rock school renovation or future renov you can support the new public safety building you can designate it to the permanent structure at the swimming pool and you'll get a letter from the Chief Financial Officer that you can use in your tax return as a charitable deduction because your donation of that 20% that you're going to save on your taxes this year will get you a tax deduction just like it would if he would pay in the taxes but it does the sound good so thank you for all that uh I don't have any bad news I think the other thing is that we're we as you as you may not as you may have noticed or may not have noticed the Town Council doesn't have another formal meeting until August I think it's the 5th first week of August so this meeting is takes place in the July meeting so we're

manager in place and uh we're all looking forward to a great another year with vales and oh committees I want to remind you that uh we we brought up the issue the Poss well we approved three additional committees at the last meeting I don't know how many applications we've had from citizens who are interested in serving on those uh but I know there have been some who who want to serve on the merchants advisory committee U but uh Mr Mr Kamal I think is left but his his point that he brought up this evening is the kind of thing that the uh utilities advisory committee could help with it's not to do the engineering work of our utilities but it's to have a place that citizens can go to a group of people look around the town where are the problems that need to be that we need to have the solutions of these engineering firms applied so that's that's that's the purpose of this kind of advisory committees it's not to do the work of the experts it's not to take over the work of the staff is to get citizens input and help guide the staff and the councel on what needs to be done but thank you all very much for coming tonight anybody else I just want to say thanks to everyone who
